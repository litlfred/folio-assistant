# `index.config.json`: what this checkout instantiates

The schema is `folio-index-config/v1` in
`cat-harness/schemas/kg/index-config.ts`.

**The index is the ONE config.** Each instance's config is written inline in
its `instances[]` entry. A `<name>.config.json` is a legacy file: imported
only as a migration step, then retired with `index-config:migrate --inline
--write`. **Never create one** — not to make a tool find a recipe, not for a
new instance. If a reader only finds config in the file, that reader is the
bug; fix it to read the index entry first.

`index.config.json` holds three facts about how a checkout is instantiated:
which harnesses are instantiated, which one is `/` (a checkout has one
`<base>/index.html`), and where each one comes from, so each is stated once
rather than spread across every root config. **When it exists at the root it
is authoritative.** When it is absent, readers fall back to the root
`*.config.json` files, their `site.landing` flags, and `remoteMounts` on the
root declaration.

```json
{
  "$schema": "folio-index-config/v1",
  "instances": [
    { "name": "folio-assistant", "source": { "local": { "at": "." } } },
    { "name": "cat-harness" },
    { "name": "my-ig", "source": { "remote": { "repository": "owner/my-ig", "ref": "<40-char sha>",
        "overrides": { "my-ig": { "whole": true } }, "trust": { "consent": { "...": "..." } } } } },
    { "name": "my-guide", "contentType": "document", "site": { "build": { "sourceSteps": ["site:document"] } } }
  ],
  "site": { "landing": "cat-harness" }
}
```

## Instantiated is a different fact from declared

A declaration (`<name>.json`) says what an instance **declares**. It travels
with the harness into every checkout that uses the harness. An
`index.config.json` entry says the instance is instantiated **in this
checkout**. Without an index, a `<name>.config.json` at the root says the
same thing. Tiles, the landing and the hub listing are all drawn from the
instantiated set, which `instantiatedHarnessNames(root)` returns. Never
derive that set from declarations or from a directory listing.

The dependencies of an instantiated harness are not instantiated just
because a mount's closure brought them in. They keep a group of their own
rather than disappearing.

A harness that a KG subscription chose is instantiated the same way:
`kg:instantiate` adds its entry, with its config inline, when the checkout
has an index (and only without one writes a root `<name>.config.json`).

## Inline, over a legacy import while one remains

Each entry's effective config is built like this:

1. Start from a legacy imported file, while one remains. That is `import`
   when it is given, else `<name>.config.json`, and only if the file exists.
   The target state is that no such file exists.
2. Overlay every other key of the entry (everything except `name`, `import`,
   `source` and `_comment`) as an inline `HarnessConfig` field. Objects merge
   key by key, and arrays and scalars are replaced. Inline fields win.

`effectiveInstanceConfig(root, name)` computes it. `readHarnessConfig(dir)`
returns it for any instance that an index lists, walking outward from the
instance root and stopping at the first directory that holds either the index
or the instance's own config. An instance the index does not list is read
from its own config file. Readers that are handed a root and a name (the site
recipe in `build-instance-site.ts`) use `readInstanceConfig` in
`cat-harness-tools/scripts/instance-config.ts`, which reads the same way and
REPORTS every legacy file it reads.

**Retiring the files** is `index-config:migrate --inline --write`: each
imported file is folded into its entry by exactly the overlay above, so no
effective config changes, and the file is deleted.
`index-config:inline:check` fails while one remains.

## Local or remote

- `source` absent: local, at `<name>/`.
- `source.local.at`: local, at that path. Use `.` for the instance declared
  at the root.
- `source.remote`: a remote mount. It is a `remoteMounts` entry minus
  `harness`, which is the entry's `name`. It **reuses** `RemoteMountSchema`
  instead of restating it, so it has `ref` (not `pin`), `overrides.<name>.whole`
  and `.path`, `note`, `trust.consent` and `track`, and every field added to
  `RemoteMountSchema` arrives with no edit here.

There is **one read path and one write path** for remote mounts:

- **Read:** `readDeclaredMounts(instanceRoot)` returns the index's remote
  entries when an index exists, else the declaration's `remoteMounts`. If both
  carry mounts it **throws and names both files**. It never picks one.
- **Write:** `writeDeclaredMounts(instanceRoot, mounts)` always writes
  `index.config.json`, seeding the index from the checkout first if there is
  none. It refuses while the declaration still carries `remoteMounts`. Nothing
  writes `remoteMounts` on a declaration.

## Which harness `/` is

`resolveLandingInstance(root)` is the only reader. It applies these rules in
order:

| condition | `/` is |
|---|---|
| the index is unreadable | **`invalid`**: the gate fails. There is no fallback to the flags, because the index was written to override them |
| the index's `site.landing` names an instance it lists | that instance (`by: "index"`) |
| the index's `site.landing` is `"hub"` | the neutral hub: the harness listing and the todo panel |
| the index's `site.landing` names an instance it does not list | **`invalid`**: the gate fails, and it is never a silent fallback |
| no `site.landing` (or no index), one instance | that instance (`sole`) |
| no `site.landing`, several instances, exactly one config flags `site.landing: true` | the flagged one |
| several flagged | the hub |
| none flagged | `ambiguous`: `check:landing-instance` fails, because the answer is never guessed |
| nothing instantiated | `none`: a state of its own, not a default |

`gen-landing-data.ts` and `sync-docs-harness.ts` ask this resolver. They do
not use their own location.

`check:landing-instance` also checks that the index and the root
`*.config.json` files **agree**:

- A root config that the index does not import **fails the check**: without
  the index it would instantiate a harness, with it it does not, and nothing
  picks between them silently.
- An `import` that names a missing file also fails the check.
- An entry with no config file at all is the target state, and passes.
- A legacy file an entry still imports is reported every time. It passes
  while it is a **pending migration** (every key it holds is either not inline
  or inline with the same value). It **fails** when the entry overrides one of
  its keys with a different value: the file's value is then dead text that a
  reader of the file alone takes for the config.

## A harnessed repository runs its checks on its own pull requests

Instantiating a harness in a repository includes turning its checks on there,
through **one** reusable workflow the harness owns, never a copy per
repository, so a layer is judged on its own pull requests and not only when an
index re-pins it. Switching off a repository's builds must not switch off its
gates.

The workflow is the tools layer's `.github/workflows/layer-pr-checks.yml`. A
repository calls it from a workflow of about fifteen lines that runs on
`pull_request`:

```yaml
jobs:
  checks:
    uses: <owner>/<tools-layer>/.github/workflows/layer-pr-checks.yml@main
    with:
      mode: layer              # or `index`: the repository is its own index
      instance: <instance>     # layer mode: its directory in the folio-assistant index
      path-in-repo: <instance> # where the instance sits in the repository ('.' at the root)
```

- **`layer` mode** is for a repository that an index mounts, such as
  cat-harness or the DAK layer. The workflow checks out folio-assistant and puts
  the PR in place of the locked mount.
- **`index` mode** is for a repository that is its own index: an IG
  repository over the DAK layer, smart-ra, or a folio. Its own `index.lock.json`
  is replayed.
- **The gates** are the harness's graph checks over the repository's own
  instance, plus every `check:*` / `*:check` script of that instance **and
  its whole dependency harness** (its transitive `needs`). Each is named
  `<owning-instance>:<script>`.
- **A PR fails only on what it newly breaks.** Each gate and test runs on main
  and on the PR. Anything already red on main is listed, never hidden, and
  never counted against the PR.

**A layer PR that declares a new directory is red on two index gates it
cannot clear.** The index README lists every declared directory, so the PR
leaves `index:render:check` and `readme:sync:root:check` stale, and only the
index re-pin that takes the PR regenerates the README. Read those two as
expected when they are the only new failures, and run them green in the
index re-pin instead.

**Disabling a repository's automatic builds is not disabling its checks.**
When an IG repository's automatic gh-pages or IG Publisher triggers are
switched off (the onboarding question in the FHIR IG layer's `ig-build-pipeline`),
the harness caller stays on.

## The exemptions of the index's own workflows

`.github/workflows/` belongs to the index, so the steps CI runs there that the
local gate set does not are exempted HERE, under `gateExemptions.steps`, each
with a `kind` and a `reason` (`GateExemptionsSchema`, the same shape an
instance declaration carries). They land in the same change as the workflow
step, never ahead of it in a layer: an exemption for a step CI does not yet
run matches nothing, and `gates-workflows.test.ts` refuses a stale exemption
as it refuses an unclassified step.

```jsonc
"gateExemptions": {
  "steps": [
    { "match": "bun run cat state:push -- --id health", "kind": "ci-only", "reason": "…" }
  ]
}
```

An instance still exempts its OWN scripts and steps in its own declaration.

## `index.lock.json`, and the legacy name

The lock records what the declared mounts resolved to. It is generated by
`mount:remote` and kept as a **separate file**. The legacy name is
`<root-instance>.mount-lock.json`. The rules for each reader and writer:

- **Writers** write `index.lock.json`. `mount:remote` first renames a legacy
  lock onto the new name, so the old file is moved, never dropped.
- **Readers** take `index.lock.json` first, then fall back to the legacy
  `*.mount-lock.json`, so downstream folios and old branches still replay.
  The readers are:
  - `mount-from-lock.ts`
  - `mountedInstanceRoots`
  - `mountedUnder` in `git-corpus.ts`
  - `mount:remote:check`
- **Both files present is an error that names both.** Two locks are never
  merged.

`mount-from-lock.ts` imports only `node:*`, so it restates the rule inline
and its test holds it to `lockFilesIn`.

**A re-pin ends with one commit per layer, and moves pins only forward**
(owner ruling, 2026-11-06, card "Pin target", A). Every layer the change
needs is pinned in the same re-pin, and the re-pin PR holds the pins and
nothing else: a change that needs the new pins stacks on it (owner ruling,
2026-11-07). The one exception is a change mutually dependent with the
re-pin, where neither passes alone. It may share the PR, and the body says
why. The rules are in [`remote-mount`](remote-mount.md) §"Re-pinning".

## The reserved `index` stem

`index.config.json` ends in `.config.json`, so a scan that treats "each root
`*.config.json` is a harness" would find a harness called `index`. The
`index` stem is therefore reserved across the board:

- `rootConfigStems` skips every `index.*` file. It is the one root scan;
  every other reader calls it or `instantiatedHarnessNames`.
- `findDeclarationFile` skips every `index.*` file too.
- The index schema refuses an instance named `index`, and `hub`, because that
  is the landing keyword.

Do not add another copy of the scan: a new copy is how the reserved name
leaks back in.

## The generated `.gitignore` block

```
# BEGIN index mounts (generated from index.config.json — do not edit)
/my-ig/
# END index mounts
```

The block holds one `/<path>/` line per remote instance in the index, where
the path is `overrides.<name>.path`, else `<name>/`. After those it lists
every further instance root the lock records, because a mount's closure can
land instances that the index never names. Three things write the block:

- `mount:remote`
- `writeDeclaredMounts`
- `index-config:migrate --write`

`check:index-ignores` fails when the block is missing or disagrees with the
index. When an index exists, `mount:remote` **does not append to
`.git/info/exclude`**: a local exclude rule is invisible to every other
clone, so a path the committed block does not cover is reported as not
ignored. Without an index, it still appends there.

## Converting a checkout: `index-config:migrate`

```sh
bun run cat index-config:migrate                 # print the index it would write, and its findings
bun run cat index-config:migrate --write         # write it; move remoteMounts; write the block; rename the lock
bun run cat index-config:migrate --check         # exit 1 when --write would change anything (a gate here)
bun run cat index-config:migrate --inline --write  # also fold each <name>.config.json into its entry, and delete it
bun run cat index-config:inline:check            # exit 1 while any imported <name>.config.json remains
bun run cat index-config:migrate --root <clone>  # a separated repository's standalone checkout
```

The converter reads only the files under `--root`, so it runs on a
standalone clone of any separated repository.

- **Which root configs it imports:** a root `<name>.config.json` is imported
  only when `name` is an instance the checkout declares (at the root or one
  level down) or mounts. Anything else becomes an **`unmatched-config`
  finding** and is not imported. A repository cut from a fork, for example,
  can carry the fork's own `<fork>.config.json`; importing it would
  instantiate a harness the repository does not hold.
- **Re-runs:** it is idempotent. A re-run moves only the `remoteMounts`
  entries that the declaration has gained since the last run. An entry the
  index already holds identically is dropped from the declaration. An entry
  the index holds differently **throws**, and you reconcile it by hand.
