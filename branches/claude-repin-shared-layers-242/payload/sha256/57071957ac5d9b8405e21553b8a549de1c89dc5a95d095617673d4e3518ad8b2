  The translation watcher: a scheduled fresh session that keeps every locale
  of every layer current after the source moves. Cold start, then, per
  layer, detect, refresh the templates, merge them into each locale,
  translate only the new and fuzzy strings with the fixed terms, run the
  gates, round-trip the changed strings, write the QA report, open one PR to
  main, merge it only where the layer declares merge-when-green, and report source
  mistakes as one issue. Use for "refresh the translations", "a template check
  failed", and when scheduling or running the watcher.

# Translation refresh — the watcher

The watcher is the last step of a multi-locale translation, and it runs for as
long as the translations exist. It is a scheduled fresh session in the
`translation-source-lead` lane of
[`translation-refresh.bpmn`](../../processes/translation-refresh.bpmn),
which [`multi-locale-translation.bpmn`](../../processes/multi-locale-translation.bpmn)
schedules. This page is what that session follows, cold, with nothing
remembered from the session that scheduled it.
[`translation-manager`](translation-manager.md) is the reference for every term
used here; read its §"Translating into several locales as a team" first.

**Generic on purpose.** Nothing here names a layer. Where a step depends
on the layer (where its pages live, which extractor writes its page
templates, how its terminology supplements are built), the layer's own
`AGENTS.md` names it, and you read it there.

## What wakes it

- **The schedule** set when the watcher was armed. A run that finds nothing
  to refresh ends at once, and that is the usual run.
- **A template check that failed**, on main or on a PR: a source change that
  did not refresh its templates. Run the watcher for that layer before
  anything else touches its catalogues.

## Cold start, once per run

1. **Clone each layer** the run covers, and follow its `AGENTS.md` cold
   start to lay down every pinned layer from its `index.lock.json`. In a
   composed checkout that is, in order: clone the mounts the lock lists,
   `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun run cat mount:lock`,
   `bun run cat mount:remote:check`. Never mount a layer at a floating ref,
   and never edit a mounted layer: a fix to one is a PR to its repository.
2. **Attach each repository** the run may push to. In a hosted session that
   is the session's add-repository tool, with push access. A repository the
   run cannot push to is reported, and the run goes on with the others.
3. **Note the merge policy.** Each layer's `AGENTS.md` (§ Translations)
   declares it. The default, when nothing is declared, is **open only**: the
   run opens PRs and merges nothing. A layer may declare
   **merge-when-green** (step 9).

## Per layer, in order

`<root>` is the layer's directory in the checkout. Every command below
takes `--instance <root>`, so one checkout serves every layer.

| step | command | moves on when |
|---|---|---|
| 1. detect | `translation:status --instance <root>`, `translation:drift:check --instance <root>`, `translation:obsolete:check --instance <root>`, and the layer's template checks | any shows something to do |
| 2. refresh templates | the layer's extractors (`translate-bpmn --instance <root> --extract` for diagrams; pages and glossary as its `AGENTS.md` names) | the template checks pass |
| 3. merge into each locale | `msgmerge --update --backup=none`, or `translation:obsolete --instance <root>` | every catalogue matches its template |
| 4. translate new and fuzzy | by hand or by agent, with the locale term base | no empty or fuzzy entry is left |
| 5. gates | below | every gate passes |
| 6. round trip | [`translation-round-trip.bpmn`](../../processes/translation-round-trip.bpmn) on the changed strings | both drift and not-drift are recorded |
| 7. QA report | `translation:page-qa --instance <root>`, and the report | it is written |
| 8. one PR | one per layer, based on main and targeting main | it is open |
| 9. merge | only under merge-when-green, all green, round trip no fail | merged, or left open and reported |
| 10. source mistakes | one issue on the source | filed, or none found |

### 1. Detect

```sh
bun run cat translation:status --instance <root>        # new, fuzzy, empty, per locale
bun run cat translation:drift:check --instance <root>   # each .po against the .pot beside it
bun run cat translation:obsolete:check --instance <root>  # msgids the source no longer yields
```

Then the layer's template checks: `translate-bpmn:check` for its
diagrams, and the page and glossary template checks its `AGENTS.md` names.
Any of them failing, or any count above zero, is a change to refresh.

**Exit 2 is not "nothing to do".** These commands exit 2 when they cannot
determine the answer, for example when a layer declares no
`translation-sources` directory. Report it for that layer and go on to
the next; never read it as current.

### 2. Refresh the templates

Re-run the layer's extractors, once, for every locale. Diagrams:

```sh
bun run cat translate-bpmn --instance <root> --extract
```

Pages and glossary schemes: the extractors the layer's `AGENTS.md`
names. A generator that writes below a mounted layer leaves that mount
modified; re-lay it from the lock afterwards, as the cold start says.

### 3. Merge into each locale

Merge each refreshed template into every locale's catalogue:

- **new strings arrive empty**: they are the work of step 4;
- **changed strings arrive fuzzy**, with the old translation kept as a hint;
- **obsolete strings are kept as `#~` entries**, never deleted, so the
  translation can be revived if the source comes back.

With gettext installed,
`msgmerge --update --backup=none <locale.po> <template.pot>` does all three.
Without it,
`bun run cat translation:obsolete --instance <root>` marks the obsolete
entries, and the layer's `AGENTS.md` names how its new strings are added.
Then re-run step 1's `translation:drift:check`: it fails while any catalogue
still differs from its template.

### 4. Translate only the new and fuzzy strings

Translate the empty and fuzzy entries in every locale, and nothing else. A
string already translated is not re-translated, even where you would have
worded it differently today. Translate with the locale term base
([`translation-manager`](translation-manager.md) §"The locale term base"):
a term a lower layer fixes keeps its fixed form. Clear `#, fuzzy` only on an
entry you have actually re-translated.

FHIR terms go into the locale's one CodeSystem supplement, never into the
resource. Translation-node manifests stay `official: false`,
`generatedBy: "agent"`. Write no `status.json`.

**A mistake in the source is not fixed here.** Translate what the source says,
and note the location for step 10.

### 5. Gates

```sh
bun run cat check:translation-officiality
bun run cat translation:catalogue:check
bun run cat translated-links:check
bun run cat kg:locale:check --instance <root>
bun run cat translation:glossary:check --instance <root> --locale <locale>
```

The first three read the checkout they run in and take no `--instance`, so
run them from the checkout that holds the layer. Then the layer's
supplement build: the locale's CodeSystem supplements
compile with no SUSHI error and pass their structural checks (the command is
in the layer's `AGENTS.md`). Placeholders, tags and URLs are preserved:
`translation:page-qa` reports a lost one as `translation-terms-preserved`.

A gate that fails is fixed in the `.po`, the manifest or the supplement, and
step 5 runs again. A glossary hit on a platform term in text of another
subject area is a sense check, not a violation: read it, note it in the
report, and change nothing because of it.

### 6. Round trip on the changed strings

Run [`translation-round-trip.bpmn`](../../processes/translation-round-trip.bpmn)
on the strings this run translated, and only those. The method is in
[`translation-manager`](translation-manager.md) §"The untainted round trip,
as run". When two separate parties cannot be dispatched, record "could not
dispatch" with the reason: it is never a pass, and the PR says so.

### 7. QA report

```sh
bun run cat translation:page-qa --instance <root>
```

writes the per-catalogue sidecars under the layer's
`test/results/translation-qa/`. Beside them, write the locale's report: the
strings refreshed, each gate's result, the round-trip counts (sampled,
flagged, drift, not drift) with every drift ruling and its fix, the glossary
violations and sense checks, and the source mistakes found.

### 8. One PR per layer, to main

One branch from main, one PR to main, carrying every locale this run
refreshed for that layer. Never push to a source PR's branch, and never
to a branch that has already merged. The PR body links the QA report.

### 9. Merge, by the layer's policy

The policy is the layer's to declare, in its `AGENTS.md`:

- **open only** (the default): open the PR, merge nothing, report it.
- **merge-when-green**: merge the run's own refresh PR only when every check
  is green **and** the untainted round trip on the changed strings records no
  fail. Anything red, uncertain or failing is left open and reported to the
  owner; the next run looks again.

Either way the translations stay unofficial: merging is not sign-off. Never
merge a PR the run did not open, and never one to a repository the owner has
said only a person merges.

### 10. Source mistakes: one issue

Every source-text mistake the translators noted goes into **one** issue on
the source repository, with the location and the reading the translation
took. Not one per locale, and not a fix in the translation: a fix to the
source is a source PR, and the next run carries it to every locale.

## Never

- **Never re-extract per locale.** Templates are refreshed once, for every
  locale.
- **Never re-translate a finished string**, and never delete an obsolete one.
- **Never write `official: true`.** A person makes a translation official
  ([`human-translation-workflow`](../../processes/human-translation-workflow.bpmn)).
- **Never read exit 2 as clean.** "Could not tell" is reported, every time.
