/**
 * Graph-aware search across the authored corpus and the ingested library.
 *
 * `searchGraph` answers "which nodes contain these words". `neighbors` answers
 * "what is adjacent to this node". Both already exist, both already span the
 * authored and ingested populations — and they are disjoint operations. To use
 * one with the other today you search, copy an id, walk its neighbourhood, and
 * repeat per hit. The graph therefore contributes nothing to a search, which is
 * the one thing it is uniquely able to do.
 *
 * ## Why the graph belongs in the search
 *
 * The corpus-grep checklist an agent runs before declaring anything open asks
 * *"has anyone worked this topic?"*. A lexical search answers that for the
 * words the asker happened to choose. It cannot answer it for a prior result
 * written in different words — which is the case that actually costs a
 * session, because the grep comes back empty and reads as a clean bill.
 *
 * The graph is exactly the structure that survives a change of vocabulary. A
 * block that never says "Temperley-Lieb" but `uses` one that does is one hop
 * from the query. So: seed lexically, expand structurally, and say which is
 * which.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT do
 *
 * It does not invent a relevance score. `searchGraph` deliberately refuses to
 * rank, on the grounds that a made-up order hides the fact that everything
 * matched equally, and that reasoning holds here. Ordering is by facts the
 * index actually knows — which field matched, and how many hops away a node
 * is — never by a similarity number. `hops: 0` reproduces `searchGraph`'s
 * result exactly, so nothing is lost by routing through this.
 *
 * ## Provenance is reported, not merged
 *
 * "Open in this corpus" and "settled in a paper we hold" are different
 * verdicts, and conflating them is the specific error the checklist's fifth
 * path exists to prevent. Counts are split by provenance in every result, so a
 * caller can see at a glance that a topic has 40 library hits and no authored
 * ones — the shape that means *cite it*, not *derive it*.
