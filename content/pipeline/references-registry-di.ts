/**
 * Dependency injection point for the bibliography.
 *
 * The reference database is CONTENT: in qou it is
 * `content/schema/references.ts`, ~7900 lines of CSL-JSON entries. It belongs
 * to the folio, the same way the values registry and the Lake package list do.
 *
 * Six pipeline files imported it directly as `../../schemas/references` — a
 * path that does not exist in this repo. They did not merely fail to
 * type-check; **every one of them threw `Cannot find module` at import**, so
 * `validate-bib`, `bib-qa`, `export-bibtex`, `export-json`,
 * `validate-references` and `validate-references-human-review` could not run
 * here at all. The whole bibliography subsystem was dead code, and nothing
 * said so, because `content/**` was outside the tsconfig program (bean
 * `folio-assistant-tsca`) and nothing else imports these entry points.
 *
 * This mirrors `value-registry-di.ts` exactly, including the Proxy that lets
 * consumers keep writing `references` as a value. Downstream runner scripts
 * call `configureReferenceRegistry` before invoking pipeline functions — see
 * qou's `scripts/run-validate.ts` for the established shape.
 *
 * @module content/pipeline/references-registry-di
