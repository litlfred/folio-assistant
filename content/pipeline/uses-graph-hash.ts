/**
 * Hash of a chapter's `uses[]` edge set — the invalidation signal for
 * graph-scoped QA criteria.
 *
 * The detangler axis answers questions about the GRAPH: forward references,
 * dependency cycles, cone depth, graph energy. Editing block A's `uses[]`
 * therefore changes block B's verdict while B's own `.md` / `.ts` / `.lean` are
 * untouched. Keyed only on its own files, B stays `fresh-skip` and keeps a
 * verdict that is now wrong — observed live in qou, where breaking three
 * dependency cycles left 15 blocks still recording
 * `detangler-no-dependency-cycle: fail` for cycles that no longer existed.
 *
 * Criteria opt in via `also_invalidated_by: ["graph"]`; only their entries
 * carry and compare the resulting `field_hash.graph`.
 *
 * Its own module rather than part of `qa-sweep` so it is importable without
 * executing that CLI, and rather than part of `qa-utils` because
 * `content-graph` already imports `walkBlocks` from there — this would close an
 * import cycle.
 *

 * import cycle. `qa-sweep` is a leaf consumer of both.
 *
 * Hashes the EDGES, not the manifests: an edit to a `.ts` that leaves `uses[]`
 * alone must not invalidate the detangler axis, or this would reintroduce the
