/**
 * QA checkers for the `dak` adapter — WHO SMART Guidelines L2/L3 blocks.
 *
 * The adapter-scoping machinery landed before anything was registered in it,
 * which meant `dak` blocks would sweep clean by default: every paper criterion
 * correctly `n/a`, and no DAK criterion to take its place. A corpus that
 * reports no findings because nothing was asked is the exact false pass the
 * §5 integration contract exists to prevent, so these are the first axes that
 * actually ask something.
 *
 * ## What these check, and what they deliberately leave alone
 *
 * Structural presence and well-formedness — does the manifest have the
 * artefact its kind promises, does the artefact parse, does it declare the
 * thing its kind says it declares. **Not** semantic conformance: whether a
 * profile is valid against its base, whether a CQL library compiles, whether
 * a DMN table is complete over its inputs. Those need the real validators
 * (`fhir-validation`, SUSHI, a DMN engine) and belong to the L3 pipeline in
 * `docs/workflows/l3-fhir-pipeline.bpmn`, not to a grep.
 *
 * Reimplementing them here would produce a second, weaker verdict that
 * disagrees with the authoritative one — the argument §2c of the ingestion
 * proposal makes against a second copy of the corpus, applied to validation.
 *
 * ## The `depends_on` trap, deliberately walked around
 *
 * `dak-companion-present` exists to catch a manifest whose artefact is
 * missing. It therefore must NOT declare that artefact in `depends_on`, which
 * gates applicability: doing so would `n/a` exactly the blocks it exists to
 * flag. It depends on `ts` (always present) and looks for the companion
 * itself. That is what `also_invalidated_by` is for, and it is the case
 * `schemas/block-qa.ts` documents.

/**
 * The companion each DAK kind must carry to be more than a stub.
 *
 * **Only kinds whose artefact is genuinely one-file-per-block appear here**,
 * and the list is what real WHO content actually contains rather than what the
 * authoring skills describe. Measured across `smart-dak-immz`, `smart-dak-bds`
 * and `smart-immunizations`:
 *
 * | Kind | Artefact | Evidence |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `business-process` | `.bpmn` | 8 processes, 8 files |
 * | `cql-library` | `.cql` | 279 files, pairing 1:1 by stem with 279 `.fsh` Library instances |
 * | FHIR kinds | `.fsh` | 739 files |
 *
 * ## Why `decision-table` is NOT here
 *
 * An earlier version required a `.dmn` for `decision-table` and
 * `scheduling-logic`, on the strength of this repo's own `dmn-authoring` skill
 * and the "Decision logic · DMN tables" activity in
 * `docs/workflows/l2-dak-authoring.bpmn`. Measured against real content there
 * are **zero `.dmn` files across all three repositories** — WHO authors
 * decision-support logic as a spreadsheet
 * (`input/decision-logic/IMMZ DAK_decision-support logic.xlsx`). The
 * requirement would have failed every decision-table block for a missing
 * artefact WHO does not produce.
 *
 * The deeper reason those kinds cannot have a required companion is that one
 * workbook holds **many** blocks: a single decision-support spreadsheet covers
 * every decision table, one dictionary covers every data element, one
 * indicators file covers every indicator. A per-block companion does not
 * exist until an extraction stage splits them, which is the DAK counterpart of
 * Stage B and is not built. Requiring one now would report a defect in every
 * such block, in a corpus that is correctly formed.

 *
 * An earlier note here claimed no per-block artefact exists for these until an
 * extraction stage is built. That is true of the *source* and false of the
 * DAK as published: WHO's own tooling already splits the workbook, generating
 * one FHIR instance per row — `IMMZ DAK_functional and non-functional
