/**
 * Per-criterion checker hashing.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `computeCriterionScriptHashes` used to record `script_hash` as the hash of
 * the WHOLE checker source file. The freshness gate (`entryIsFresh`) treats a
 * changed `script_hash` as "this verdict was produced by a different checker,
 * re-run it", so a whole-file hash means:
 *
 *   editing ONE criterion invalidates EVERY criterion defined in that file,
 *   across EVERY block in the corpus.
 *
 * Checker files are large and multi-criterion — `qa-checkers-extended.ts`
 * defines 40 criteria, `qa-checkers-voice.ts` 10 — so a one-line fix to one
 * checker rewrote thousands of sidecar entries whose verdicts had not changed
 * and could not have changed. In qou that churn grew large enough that no
 * feature branch could carry it: PRs #4843, #4596 and #4597 each had to revert
 * 18-408 files of it, so the provenance was never committed, so the drift grew.
 *
 * Hashing each criterion over only the code it can actually reach fixes this at
 * the source. An unchanged criterion keeps its hash, stays `fresh-skip`, and its
 * sidecar entry is never rewritten — which also means `script_commit_sha` and
 * `reviewed_at` stop churning, without any schema change.
 *
 * ## What is hashed
 *
 * The criterion's dispatch entry (its property in the exported
 * `*_AUTOMATED_CHECKERS` record) plus the transitive closure of module-local
 * declarations it references. Cross-module imports are NOT followed — that
 * matches the previous whole-file behaviour, which never hashed other files
 * either, so this is not a new gap. Declared `extra_inputs` remain covered
 * separately by `deps_hash`.
 *
 * ## Failure mode is deliberately one-directional
 *
 * A hash that is too NARROW is dangerous: it silently keeps a stale verdict
 * that a checker change should have invalidated. A hash that is too WIDE only
 * costs churn. So every uncertain path here returns `null` and the caller falls
 * back to the whole-file hash — over-invalidate, never under-invalidate.
 *
 * ## Coverage, and what still falls back
 *
 * 50 of the 66 automated criteria resolve per-criterion. The two files with the
 * worst fan-out are the ones this fixes: `qa-checkers-extended.ts` (34 of 41)
 * and `qa-checkers-voice.ts` (10 of 10).
 *
 * The 16 that fall back do so for a structural reason worth recording: the
 * analysis looks for the dispatch entry inside the criterion's declared
 * `source_file`, and for some criteria the dispatch lives in a different module
 * from the checker logic. The 9 `qa-checkers-python.ts` criteria are dispatched
 * from `script-sweep.ts`, so their entry is not in the file being hashed. They
 * keep whole-file behaviour — no regression, and their mutual invalidation is
 * contained to those 9. Teaching the analysis to follow a dispatcher in another
 * module would close that gap; it is not needed for the churn this fixes.
