/**
 * Typed content dependency graph — editorial + formal edges, unioned.
 *
 * ## Two relations, deliberately distinct
 *
 * A content block participates in **two different** dependency
 * relations, and conflating them is a category error:
 *
 * - **editorial** — from the block manifest's `uses[]` array **and its
 *   `interprets` field**. Answers "what must a reader have read to follow
 *   this block?" Authored: agent/human maintained, part of the content. See
 *   `schemas/types.ts` → `BlockBase.uses` and `RemarkBlock.interprets`.
 *
 *   Both fields state the same reader-facing fact, so both are editorial: a
 *   remark interpreting a proposition cannot be followed without it. This was
 *   `uses[]` alone until 2026-08-15 (owner decision, bean `i8ad`), so the graph
 *   answered "what must a reader have read?" while omitting 342 authored
 *   statements of exactly that, and they were absent from every cone, energy
 *   and reachability measure.
 *
 *   Note what this does **not** change: `loadChapterGraph` in
 *   `qa-checkers-extended.ts` builds its own `uses`-only adjacency and does not
 *   consume this module, so `detangler-no-forward-ref` is unaffected and its
 *   count stands at 195. Ten `interprets` edges do point forward, and that gate
 *   does not see them — a real gap, now visible, and deliberately left as a
 *   separate decision rather than folded into this one.
 *
 *   Each editorial edge carries `editorialField` so a consumer can still tell
 *   which field an author wrote. That matters for anything *proposing* an
 *   edit: `uses[]` is a curated list, `interprets` is a single structural
 *   claim, and they are not interchangeable to a writer even though they are
 *   to a reader.
 * - **formal** — from the Lean dependency graph, resolved through each
 *   block's `lean.ref`. Answers "what does this proof actually invoke?"
 *   Machine-derived, never hand-written, never stored in a manifest.
 *
 * They diverge in both directions, legitimately. A proof invokes
 * `simp` lemmas nobody needs to read about (formal, not editorial). A
 * theorem is motivated by an example it never formally cites
 * (editorial, not formal). **Neither divergence is a defect**, and
 * nothing in this module or downstream of it may "reconcile" the two
 * by writing into `uses[]`.
 *
 * ## What this module is for
 *
 * Graph questions come in two flavours and want different edge sets:
 *
 * | Question | Edge set |
 * |----------|----------|
 * | "What must a reader read first?" (ordering, forward refs, graph energy) | `editorial` |
 * | "Is this provable block downstream of a conjecture?" (soundness) | `formal`, falling back to `editorial` |
 * | "What breaks if this changes?" (blast radius, triage, impact) | **union** |
 *
 * So every edge carries an `EdgeKind` and every accessor takes an
 * optional kind filter. The default is the **union** — the honest
 * answer to the impact question, and the safe default for a caller
 * that has not thought about which relation it means.
 *
 * ## Degradation
 *
 * Formal edges come from the Lean Atlas ingest cache
 * (`docs/audits/lean-atlas-deps.json`, written by
 * `content/pipeline/lean-atlas-ingest.ts`). When that cache is absent
 * — no Lean toolchain, no Atlas, a non-math folio — `hasFormal` is
 * `false`, the formal edge set is empty, and the union degrades
 * exactly to the editorial graph. That is the pre-existing behaviour,
 * so no consumer regresses when the cache is missing; consumers that
 * need to distinguish "no formal edges" from "formal edges not
 * available" must check `hasFormal` and report `n/a` rather than a
 * false clean bill.
