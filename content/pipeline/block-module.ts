/**
 * Load a content block by **importing** it, rather than scanning its
 * source text.
 *
 * A block's `.ts` is a module whose default export is the result of a
 * builder (`theorem({...})`), and the builder validates against the Zod
 * schema before returning. Importing therefore yields the block the rest
 * of the pipeline sees — right kind, right label, right `uses[]` — with
 * no parser to drift.
 *
 * ## Why the scanners existed, and why the reasons do not hold
 *
 * `conjectural-propagation-audit` carried this note above its regex:
 * *"Crude but sufficient parse … Avoid running TS — too slow + needs
 * deps."* Both halves were measured on a 300-block synthetic corpus:
 *
 *     regex scan      34 ms   151 blocks read, 149 SKIPPED
 *     module import  197 ms   263 blocks read,   0 skipped
 *
 * "Needs deps" is false — Bun imports TypeScript natively, and
 * `prune-transitive-deps` in this same tree already imported blocks to
 * read them. "Too slow" is 0.66 ms per block: about two seconds on a
 * corpus of three and a half thousand, for an audit.
 *
 * The 149 skipped is the real cost of the scan. Those audits matched
 * `export default (definition|theorem|…)` against a hand-written list of
 * twelve kinds, while `Block` has fifteen — `algorithm`, `proof` and
 * `table` were invisible to them. `schemas/types.ts` already documents
 * this exact drift costing ~13% of the qou corpus across five other
 * lists; these two were a sixth and seventh nobody had found. A `proof`
 * block being invisible to the *conjectural propagation* audit is the
 * sharp end of it: that audit exists to trace what rests on a conjecture.
 *
 * The scan also accepted labels the schema rejects. `label: "theorem:x"`
 * matches `/label:\s*"([^"]+)"/` happily; the builder refuses it, because
 * a theorem's label must start with `thm:`. A graph keyed on labels that
 * cannot exist is a graph of edges that cannot resolve.
 *
 * ## Failures are reported, never skipped
 *
 * A block that throws on import is a *finding*, not a file to pass over
 * silently — that is how a sweep reports clean by looking at nothing.
 * `loadBlocksUnder` separates the two outcomes it can legitimately have
 * (a block, or a file that is not a block manifest) from the one it
 * cannot swallow (a block that failed to load), and returns the failures
 * for the caller to surface.

/**
 * The synchronous sibling of `loadBlockModule`.
 *
 * `walkBlocks` — the enumeration every QA tool runs on — is a synchronous
 * generator with fourteen production callers, so it could not `await` an
 * import. That is the only reason it still reads block identity out of source
 * text with a regex, and the reason `fsl7` sat open: *"repointing needs either
 * a sync loader or a restructure … A sync loader, which bullet 1 already names.
 * Still absent."*
 *
 * It is absent no longer. Bun's `require` loads a TypeScript ES module
 * synchronously, so a block's builder runs and its validated default export
 * comes back in one call, with no promise to await.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * Measured over 300 generated block manifests plus 10 non-block helpers, cold:
 *
 *     regex readBlockManifest   16.0 ms    0.052 ms / file
 *     loadBlockModuleSync       67.1 ms    0.216 ms / file
 *
 * Four times the regex, and 0.76 s across a corpus of three and a half
 * thousand. Consistent with the 0.66 ms/block the async loader measured above.
 *
 * ## Runtime
 *
 * `require` of a `.ts` ES module is a **Bun** capability. Under a runtime that
 * cannot do it the call throws, which is the honest outcome: a caller must not
 * get silence and conclude the corpus is clean. Everything in
 * `content/pipeline` already runs under Bun.
 *
 * ## This does not decide which files to execute
 *
 * Importing a module runs it. `walkBlocks` recurses a content root and reads
 * every `.ts` beneath it, and a content tree holds more than block manifests —
 * `content/pipeline/qa-agent-drain-queue.ts` in this very repo starts a sweep
 * at import time. So the caller decides what is worth executing *before*
 * calling this, and `readBlockManifest`'s masked regex is exactly that gate:
 * cheap, and it already refuses a builder call written inside a string or a
 * comment (`#125`). Candidate detection stays textual; block *identity* comes
 * from here.
