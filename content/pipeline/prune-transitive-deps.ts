/**
 * Prune transitive dependencies from content block uses[] fields.
 *
 * If A uses B and B uses C, then A does not need C in its uses[] —
 * only immediate neighbors belong in uses[].
 *
 * This computes the transitive reduction of the dependency graph:
 * for each block, remove any uses[] entry that is reachable through
 * another uses[] entry.
 *
 * ## Editorial relation only
 *
 * `uses[]` is the **editorial** relation — what a reader must have read
 * first (see `BlockBase.uses` in `schemas/types.ts`). Transitive
 * reduction is sound HERE precisely because reading-order is transitive:
 * a reader sent to B, who is in turn sent to C, has read C. Listing C
 * directly adds nothing.
 *
 * It is NOT sound on the **formal** relation, and this script must never
 * be pointed at one. A direct formal dependency is a fact about the
 * proof term — that this declaration mentions that one — and remains
 * true no matter what else the proof also invokes. Reducing it would
 * discard real structure.
 *
 * The `uses-editorial-hygiene` QA criterion reports (as `warn`) blocks
 * this script would change.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run content/pipeline/prune-transitive-deps.ts              # dry-run (report only)
 *   bun run content/pipeline/prune-transitive-deps.ts --apply      # rewrite .ts files
 *   bun run content/pipeline/prune-transitive-deps.ts --paper NAME # multi-paper folio
 *
 * @module content/pipeline/prune-transitive-deps

// to name — and the run then died much later looking for a paper directory
// called `--apply`. `--paper` in last position gave `undefined`, which falls
// through to the "N papers found — name one explicitly" error, hiding the fact
// that the caller *did* try to name one.
//
// This is the mirror image of the positional hazard described below, which is
// why the flag form is not automatically the safe one: whichever convention you

// `--paper` matters in a MULTI-paper folio: `requirePaper()` with no argument
// throws "5 papers found — name one explicitly", and until this flag existed
// the script could not run there at all.
//
// A FLAG rather than a positional. `main`'s 21498cc ("nine scripts were
// unrunnable in a multi-paper folio") gives the general reason and is the
// better one: several scripts in this directory already use `argv[2]` for an
// output path or a `--strict` flag, so a positional would collide;
// `extract-status-sections.ts` is the match. It is also forced here
// specifically, because this script takes `--apply`: under a positional
// convention `prune-transitive-deps.ts --apply` would read `argv[2]` as the
// paper name and `requirePaper` would hand `"--apply"` straight back.
//
// That positional hazard is the MIRROR IMAGE of the flag hazard `argValue`
// guards above. Neither convention is free: whichever you pick, one token has
// to be checked for being a flag rather than a value.
//
// (An earlier version of this comment said `generate-index.ts` and
// `find-dangling-remarks.ts` both take the paper positionally and that a flag
// here was a deliberate exception. 21498cc converted `generate-index.ts` to the
// flag form, so the flag is the convention now and `find-dangling-remarks.ts`
// is the remaining positional holdout.)
