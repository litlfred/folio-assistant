/**
 * readme-toc.ts — the folio's table of contents, as Markdown for a README.
 *
 * One table per **paper in the folio**, not one table for the paper somebody
 * happened to hardcode. `scripts/generate-readme.sh` previously composed this
 * section inline with `quantum-observable-universe` and
 * `https://litlfred.github.io/qou` baked into it, which is content living in
 * the platform (AGENTS.md, "folio-assistant is the platform, not the
 * content") and wrong for every other folio.
 *
 * ## Links are resolved, never composed
 *
 * The section this replaces built PDF URLs by convention —
 * `${PAGES}/papers/<paper>/chapters/<dir>.pdf` — and checked nothing. The
 * `gh-pages` branch of the folio it was written for has no `chapters/`
 * directory at all, so all twenty-three chapter links were 404 *and had
 * always been*; three of six appendix links happened to resolve. A generated
 * table that cannot tell a live link from a dead one is worse than no table,
 * because it reads as verified.
 *
 * So every PDF cell here is checked against a real listing of the publish ref
 * (`git ls-tree -r --name-only gh-pages`) before it becomes a link. A chapter
 * whose PDF has not been published renders `—`.
 *
 * ## Link style, and why `raw` is not the private-repo answer
 *
 * A GitHub Pages URL only resolves when the Pages site is public. A private
 * folio's README full of `github.io` links is unreachable for exactly the
 * people who have access to the repository.
 *
 * `raw.githubusercontent.com` does not fix that: it returns 404 for a private
 * repository unless the request carries a token, and a browser session cookie
 * does not authenticate it. It is offered here as `linkStyle: "raw"` for
 * public folios that want hotlinkable asset URLs, and documented as
 * public-only, so the question does not have to be re-derived.
 *
 * What works for a private repository is `blob` — the default:
 * `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<ref>/<path>` honours the viewer's
 * GitHub session, and GitHub renders a PDF inline. Because the publish ref is
 * a branch in the same repository, the artefacts already have such a URL.
 *
