/**
 * The graph-aware MCP tools, extracted so they can be tested.
 *
 * They began life inside `server.ts`'s `executeTool` — a nested function in a
 * request handler, reachable only by driving the whole server. That left the
 * wiring between a tool declaration and its implementation covered by nothing
 * but `tsc`, which is precisely where the last two defects in this work turned
 * out to be hiding: a placeholder `@id` that collided twelve blocks, and a
 * `paths` object that never carried the companions the type system had learned
 * about. Both typechecked.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of the index plus the tool input, so a
 * test can call it the way the server does.
