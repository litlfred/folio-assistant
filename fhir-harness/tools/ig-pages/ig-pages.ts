For an instance whose docs declare `igSite` it writes no index, menu or category pages — the IG site's own replace them — and only a front-matter `artifacts.md` naming the Tool that drew it. `build-ig-site` renders an IG's narrative pages from source; this Tool writes the artefact pages for every IG instance (`stage-ig-sites` copies them in).",
