/**
 * Snapshot the terminology of a PUBLISHED IG at a pinned version.
 *
 * Generic to any FHIR IG whose code systems are FSH under
 * `input/fsh/codesystems/`, so it lives in fhir-harness (#1767, stage B′). It
 * was `cat-harness/scripts/pin-smart-base-terminology.ts`, with the WHO pin
 * record, snapshot path and source repository hard-coded; those are now
 * `--pin`, `--out` and `--source`. The concept extraction is unchanged.
 * The first use is still WHO's: `cat-harness/external-schemas/who-smart-base.json`,
 * which `check:term-mapping` reads, so the pin and snapshot files stay there.
 *
 * Bean `7wou` / `ejug`. The owner ruled 2026-09-30 that the `fhir` half of
 * `check:term-mapping` asserts **a published IG at a version** — not a live
 * curated collection — so the resolver needs that version's codes, offline
 * and byte-stable, rather than a service call whose answer moves.
 *
 * ## Why a snapshot rather than a fetch at check time
 *
 * Three reasons, and the first is the ruling itself. "This code exists in
 * smart-base v1.0.0" is a claim about a fixed artefact; resolving it against
 * whatever a host serves today would quietly turn it back into the live-
 * collection claim the owner did not choose.
 *
 * Second, neither host is reachable here — this environment's network policy
 * refuses `smart.who.int:443` and `api.openconceptlab.org:443` alike (the
 * proxy logs 403 on CONNECT). GitHub git reads ARE served, which is how the
 * pin is refreshed, but a gate that needs the network is a gate that fails
 * for the wrong reason.
 *
 * Third, it is small: 585 concepts, ~120 KB of FSH at v1.0.0, which is a
 * snapshot worth committing rather than a corpus worth caching.
 *
 * ## It is DERIVED from the pin, and says so
 *
 * The version comes from the pin record named by `--pin`, never from this
 * file. Moving the pin and re-running is the whole update procedure, and
 * a snapshot whose `version` disagrees with the record is a defect the check
 * reports rather than tolerates.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run fhir-harness/scripts/pin-ig-terminology.ts --from <clone> \
 *     --pin <repo-relative pin record> --out <repo-relative snapshot> --source <repository URL>
 *
 * WHO SMART base, the first and today only use:
 *   --pin cat-harness/external-schemas/who-smart-base.json
 *   --out cat-harness/external-schemas/who-smart-base.terminology.json
 *   --source https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base
 *
 * The clone is made by hand, at the pinned tag, because cloning an external
 * repository is not something a gate should do.
