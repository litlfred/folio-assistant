/**
 * Read, check, diff and render an IG **AST**: the per-resource dump the
 * `ast-export` library writes on top of the FHIR IG Publisher
 * (`litlfred/fhir-ig-publisher@claude/ast-export`, bean `a9tx`).
 *
 * @covers schemas
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-30: *"need to figure out how to list and view
 * differentials/deltas against AST ... including pipeline rendering"*. This is
 * the consumer half. The producer is Java and lives with the Publisher; this
 * lives with the layer that renders. The two meet only at the file formats
 * `ig-ast/v1`, `ig-ast-dependencies/v1` and `ig-ast-plan/v1`.
 *
 * ## An AST is a cache, never an authority
 *
 * Every manifest says `"authority": "cache"` and lists what is `provisional`
 * until a full Publisher run. Everything rendered here carries that mark to
 * the reader. This is `ig-publisher-reduction` P3's approved exit criterion:
 * a page built from cache shows a VISIBLE stale-until-full-run mark.
 *
 * ## Commands
 *
 * - `list <ast>`: what an AST holds (counts per type, edges, provenance).
 * - `validity <ast> --ig <root> [--toolchain <s>] [--at <rev>]`: whether it
 *   was built from the inputs the IG has NOW — or, with `--at`, from the
 *   inputs COMMITTED at `rev` (`inputDigestAt`), which a build writing under
 *   `input/` cannot disturb. Reuses folio-assistant-core's
 *   `compiledValidity` on the manifest's `inputs`, which the Java side writes
 *   in exactly `CompiledInputsSchema`'s shape. `inputDigest` is recomputed
 *   here by the same algorithm as the Java `InputDigest`, and a golden vector
 *   shared by both test suites keeps the two from drifting.
 * - `digest --ig <root>`: the IG's input digest now, as `validity` computes it.
 * - `source-inputs <ast> --digest <hex> --pre-export <command>`: after a
 *   `pre-export` command rewrote the tree, record the AST against the
 *   source's digest (`recordSourceInputs`).
 * - `diff <base> <head> [--plan plan.json] [--json out] [--site dir]`: the
 *   delta between two ASTs, and optionally just-the-docs pages for it.
 * - `render <delta.json> --site dir`: pages from a delta already computed.
 * - `jsonld <ast>`: the AST as linked data, against `schemas/ig-ast.context.jsonld`.
 * - `schema [--check]`: regenerate (or check) the JSON Schemas and context
 *   from the Zod declaration in `schemas/ig-ast.ts` (bean `l0lq`).
 *
 * ## What a delta says, and what it cannot
 *
 * Resources are matched by KEY (`canonical|version`, else `Type/id`), and a
 * resource whose canonical is unchanged but whose version moved is paired
 * as `versionChanged` rather than reported as a removal plus an addition.
 * A changed resource carries an element-level differential: JSON paths whose
 * value was added, removed or changed. It is a STRUCTURAL diff of the dumped
 * JSON, not a FHIR-semantic one: reordering a repeating element shows as
 * changes at each index.
