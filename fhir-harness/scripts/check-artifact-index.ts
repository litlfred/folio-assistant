/**
 * Validate every committed FHIR IG artefact index against its schema, and
 * judge every `ig-annex` declaration an instance holds.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-core/scripts/check-artifact-index
 * @covers fhir-artifact-index, ig-annex
 *
 * ## Why this exists beside the retired `ingest:ig:check`
 *
 * `ingest:ig:check` was removed once IG instances stopped committing their
 * index (#124); `ig-index:build` writes it at publish. The history below is
 * kept because it explains what this check does and does not cover.
 *
 * They answer different questions, and only one of them can be asked in CI.
 *
 * `ingest:ig:check` re-derives an index from the IG's published output and
 * fails if the committed copy differs. That is the stronger check and it needs
 * the source — the WHO SMART Trust IG's `gh-pages` is 342,656 files — which no CI runner
 * here carries. Exempted from the gate set for that reason, with the exemption
 * written down in `gates.ts` rather than left as a silence.
 *
 * This one needs nothing but the repository. It asks whether each committed
 * index is a VALID `folio-fhir-artifact-index/v2` document: schema-conformant,
 * `count` agreeing with `artifacts.length`, keys unique, no DAK overlay on an
 * index that declares `sidecarApi: "absent"`.
 *
 * That is not the whole of what `ingest:ig:check` would catch, and this file
 * does not pretend otherwise. What it does catch is the failure that is
 * actually likely: a hand-edit. The WHO SMART Trust IG's `AGENTS.md` says nothing under the
 * graph is authored, and a gate is how that stops being a request.
 *
 * ## Three outcomes
 *
 * An index the instance declares `builtAtPublish` (#124) and that this
 * checkout has not built is said as such and not judged: a consumer that
 * mounts an IG layer (a document folio mounting the DAK layer) never builds it.
 *
 * Finding no index is **not** a pass. A repository that declares no
 * `fhir-artifact-index` graph has nothing to check and says so; a scan that
 * silently returned zero would read exactly like a clean run, which is the
 * shape this repository has paid for twice (`dh4f`, `xom7`).
 *
 * ## The annex declarations that left the index
 *
 * An IG's on-demand annexes were declared in `fhir-artifact-index/
 * annexes.json` until an IG repository stopped committing an artefact index
 * (#124); they now sit in a directory of their own, the `ig-annex` kind. The
 * kind was typed and judged by nothing (`audit:coverage:require-all`,
 * folio-assistant#2681), so this gate, which already reads the declarations
 * for the index beside them, judges them too ({@link judgeIgAnnexDir}): the
 * declaration is there and is `ig-annexes/v1`, every file it names is held
 * inside its instance, nothing is declared or shown twice, and each page is
 * an `input/pagecontent/` page where the instance holds one (said, not
 * counted, where it does not). No instance declaring an `ig-annex` directory
 * is an absence of subjects, said as such — not a pass.
