/**
 * One IG → one Jekyll source for the just-the-docs pipeline, with the IG
 * Publisher's `site.data.fhir` populated (bean `bamf`).
 *
 * ## Why one site per IG (owner, 2026-09-30)
 *
 * An IG's pages say `{{ site.data.fhir.packageId }}`, not `site.data.fhir.<ig>`:
 * the Publisher builds one IG per Jekyll site, so `_data/fhir.json` names ONE
 * IG. The owner chose to keep that shape rather than rewrite the pages: each IG
 * gets its own Jekyll source and its own `_data/fhir.json`, so the pages render
 * unchanged under the Publisher and under just-the-docs alike.
 *
 * ## What it stages, from an IG source repository
 *
 * | from | to | why |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `input/pagecontent/*.md` | `<page>.md` with front matter | the pages; title, parent and order from `sushi-config.yaml` `pages:` |
 * | `input/includes/*`, `input/pagecontent/*`, `input/images/*.svg` | `_includes/` | the Publisher resolves `{% include %}` against all three, so pages include each other and inline SVGs |
 * | `input/images/**` | the site root, subdirectories kept | the Publisher publishes them there, so pages say `<img src="x.png">` or `<script src="demo/app.js">` — except a `.json`/`.jsonld` that does not parse, which is left out and reported: publishing a broken data file under our site blocks the deploy, and whose file it is cannot be told from a file no parser can read |
 * | `input/images-source/*.plantuml` | `_includes/<name>.svg` | the Publisher RENDERS these; rendered here with `--plantuml-jar`, otherwise a visible "not rendered" marker, reported |
 * | the artefact index (`--artifacts`) | `_includes/list-(simple-)?<types>.xhtml` | the Publisher GENERATES these lists of an IG's artefacts of one type; written here as Liquid over `site.data.fhir.artifact_lists`, so any IG with an index gets them (bean `9hfi`) |
 * | `ig-site-data` over the source | `_data/fhir.json` | `site.data.fhir.*`, only what is sourced |
 * | `input/data/*` (`.yml`/`.yaml`/`.json`/`.csv`/`.tsv`, and directories) | `_data/` | the Publisher's Jekyll reads them as `site.data.<stem>`; a key two sources define keeps the harness's and is a QA finding (bean `yy4u`) |
 * | — | `_config.yml` | just-the-docs, one site |
 * | the instance's declared `webpage` theme | `_sass/color_schemes/ig.scss` | just-the-docs' own colour-scheme mechanism, so the IG wears its palette with the machinery unchanged (bean `u3cd`) |
 *
 * Nothing is inferred that the source does not say: a page with no `pages:`
 * entry keeps its file name as title and is reported, and every field
 * `ig-site-data` cannot source is reported undetermined, never written empty.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run fhir-harness/scripts/build-ig-site.ts --ig-src <IG repo> --out <jekyll source> \
 *     [--baseurl /<site>/<ig>] [--plantuml-jar <plantuml.jar>] [--menu <menu.json>] [--remote-theme <owner/repo@ref>] \
 *     [--artifacts <dir>] [--artifacts-href <path>]
 *   bun run fhir-harness/scripts/build-ig-site.ts --dedupe-ids <built site>   # after jekyll build
 *
 * @module fhir-harness/scripts/build-ig-site

 * on smart-hiv: *"also need line break between IG title and top menu"* — on
 * one wrapping row the title shared the line with the menu, and the last
 * group dropped under the title. The break is the title's full-width flex
 * basis, so the markup ({@link igTopBar}) stays one `<div>`.
 *

 * gets the bar's first 2.25rem to itself (folio-assistant#2534, owner: the tab
 * sat on "Data Models and Exchange" and "Deployment"). The shared layout lets
