/**
 * ig-annex-judge.ts — what an `ig-annex` directory's `annexes.json` SAYS is
 * consistent, not only how it is shaped.
 *
 * The `ig-annex` kind (`typologies/ig-annex.json`) is TYPED by its validator:
 * `check:kind-validators` parses each declaration against `ig-annexes/v1`.
 * Typing is not judging, and the kind read `typed-only` in
 * `audit:coverage:require-all` the day an IG repository first declared one
 * (folio-assistant#2681). This is the opinion,
 * kept to what this layer's GENERIC contract (page, file, columns) can say,
 * because the annex files themselves are another layer's kind:
 *
 * - **a declaration is there** — a declared `ig-annex` directory holds an
 *   `annexes.json`. One that holds none places nothing, and the IG build
 *   (`annexesIn`) would say nothing about it.
 * - **it is `ig-annexes/v1`** — `{ $schema, annexes: [...] }`, strict. The
 *   bare array `annexesIn` still reads is the shape `fhir-artifact-index/
 *   annexes.json` carried before the kind (fhir-harness#33); an `ig-annex`
 *   directory is newer than that, so it has no reason to hold it.
 * - **every file is held, inside its instance** — `file` is relative to the
 *   directory, and resolves to a file of the same instance. One that is not
 *   held is the failure `annexesIn` throws on at build time, found here first;
 *   one outside the instance is a file an index mounting it does not carry.
 * - **no record twice, no column twice** — two records for one page and one
 *   file mount the same table twice; a column named twice is shown twice.
 * - **the page** — `page` names a file under the IG's `input/pagecontent/`.
 *   It is judged when the instance holds that directory; an index mounts only
 *   declared directories, so there it is NOT verified, and the result says
 *   so rather than counting it.
 *
 * Read by `check-artifact-index.ts`, which a CI gate runs.
