/**
 * Build each IG instance's `fhir-artifact-index/` at publish, from the IG's
 * cached AST and its own source, so no IG instance commits one (issue #124).
 *
 * @module fhir-harness/scripts/build-ig-indexes
 * @covers fhir-artifact-index
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run fhir-harness/scripts/build-ig-indexes.ts [--root <checkout>] [--only <instance>] [--work <dir>] [--plan]
 * ```
 *
 * ## Which instances
 *
 * An IG instance declares nothing of this layer's (AGENTS.md). It is found
 * the way the `ig-ast` viewer finds one (`gen-ig-ast-pages.ts`): it needs
 * this layer, directly or through a layer above it, it declares a
 * `repository`, and that repository carries an AST branch family
 * ({@link AST_FAMILY_PREFIXES}). An instance missing any of the three is
 * skipped, and the run says which and why.
 *
 * ## What it writes, per instance, at the paths every reader already uses
 *
 * - `index.json`: `ast-to-artifact-index.ts` over the AST `ig-cache.sh
 *   restore` lays down from the branch family. The AST is a cache, and the
 *   index says so (`authority: "cache"` in its manifest's inputs).
 * - `menu.json`: `buildMenu` over the IG source's `sushi-config.yaml`, at the
 *   commit cloned. `stage-ig-sites.ts` clones the IG from the `source.of` and
 *   `source.ref` this records.
 * - `releases.json`: `ingest-ig-releases.ts`, from the repository's GitHub
 *   releases. A failed read is reported and the file is not written: no
 *   release list is not the same as an empty one.
 *
 * ## The IG API sidecars a layer above leaves
 *
 * When a mounted layer provides the checkout script `ig-site:sidecars` (the
 * step an IG repository's own site runs, `ig-repo-site.ts` §"What a layer
 * above leaves for this one"), it is run here too, over the same clone and a
 * work directory of its own. What it leaves in `<work>/ig-api/sidecars/` is
 * copied to `<instance>/fhir-artifact-index/sidecars/` and bound to the
 * artefacts (`ast-to-artifact-index.ts --sidecars`), so the pages keep their
 * IG API links once no committed copy carries them. This layer runs the step
 * by its name and never knows what it writes. No such script, nothing is bound,
 * and the run says so. A step that fails fails that IG.
 *
 * ## The package, from the AST
 *
 * The JSON view pages read each resource out of `package.tgz`, at
 * `package/<Type>-<id>.json`, as the Publisher packages it. {@link packFromAst}
 * writes that file from the AST's resources, with a `package/package.json`
 * read from the IG's `sushi-config.yaml`, to `fhir-artifact-index/package.tgz`.
 * It is the AST's package, not the published one, and holds what the AST holds.
 *
 * ## The JSON-LD contexts and the FHIR version, from the IG's source
 *
 * The Publisher copies `input/images/` to the site root as it is, so a JSON-LD
 * context the IG publishes is a `.jsonld` file there whose only key is
 * `@context` ({@link contextsFrom}); a `.jsonld` holding data (`@graph`, ...)
 * is not one. Each is copied to `fhir-artifact-index/contexts/` and indexed by
 * its path without the extension. `fhirVersion` is read from
 * `sushi-config.yaml`.
 *
 * ## The IG API hub: drawn from the index, named by the layer above
 *
 * A layer above that writes the sidecars names in its descriptor
 * (`ig-api.json`) what the API is called (`label`) and the marker the IG's own
 * hub page holds (`placeholder`). The index's `igApiHub` records both and the
 * hub page's address ({@link hubFrom}); it holds no copy, because the hub is
 * drawn from the index's own bound sidecars (`ig-api-hub.ts`, bean `h7ap`).
 *
 * ## Where the IG is published
 *
 * The published links (`published.json`, `.html`, ...) need the address the
 * IG is published at, which a canonical URL is not ({@link publishedBase}). It is
 * the committed copy's `source.of` when that names a published site (the rule
 * `ig-ast-site.sh` follows), else the instance declaration's `iriBase`, else
 * none, and the run says which.
 *
 * The SITE decides the owner, not the declaration. A declaration names one
 * repository and one `iriBase`, and both travel with every copy of the
 * instance. A checkout that mounts the instance from a different repository
 * (a sync of the same IG to another owner, say) is building that repository's
 * site. So the repository is the one the checkout's `index.lock.json` mounts
 * the instance from, when it names one, and the IG is cloned from there. An
 * `iriBase` that is the declared repository's own GitHub Pages address is
 * re-based on the mounted repository's ({@link rebaseOnMount}). Any other
 * `iriBase` is a site the IG chose, and is kept.
 *
 * A committed `index.json` still on disk is read for its grouping
 * (`--keep-published-grouping`) before it is replaced, so the Publisher's
 * editorial categories survive the first build. Once the committed copy is
 * deleted, the grouping is the Publisher's default by resource type, and
 * `ast-to-artifact-index.ts` names every artefact where that differs.
 *
 * `--plan` prints what would be built and touches nothing.
 *
 * Exit: 0 every IG found was built · 1 one or more failed (each named) · 2 usage.
 *
 * Nothing here may know about WHO (fhir-harness/AGENTS.md).
