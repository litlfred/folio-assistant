Feature: Staging an IG as one just-the-docs site

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::staging_one_IG_as_one_just-the-docs_site::fhirDataFromSushiConfig
  Scenario: site.data.fhir is written from sushi-config, only what is sourced
    Given the example IG staged as a site
    When its site.data.fhir file is read
    Then it names the package "example.ig", version "0.1.0" and publisher "Example Org"
    And it holds no empty string

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::staging_one_IG_as_one_just-the-docs_site::navFromSushiPages
  Scenario: navigation comes from sushi-config pages: titles, parents, order
    When navigation is read from sushi-config pages with a nested page
    Then Home is first, Overview is second under Home, and Change Log is third
    And the staged overview page opens with front matter giving its title, parent, order and the IG footer

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::staging_one_IG_as_one_just-the-docs_site::unlistedPageKeptAndReported
  Scenario: a page sushi-config does not list is kept, titled by file name, and reported
    Given the example IG staged as a site
    Then "orphan.md" is reported as unlisted
    And its staged page is titled "orphan"

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::staging_one_IG_as_one_just-the-docs_site::pagesIncludesImagesPlaced
  Scenario: pages, includes and images land where Jekyll resolves them
    Given the example IG staged as a site
    Then its pages are changes, index, orphan and overview
    And notes, overview and index are each written to _includes
    And the logo image is published at the site root

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::staging_one_IG_as_one_just-the-docs_site::imageSubdirKept
  Scenario: a subdirectory of input/images is published as a subdirectory, as the Publisher does
    Given the example IG staged as a site
    Then the files of the "demo" image subdirectory are published under "demo"
    And the subdirectory's svg is not copied into _includes

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::an_SVG_in_input/images_is_published_minified::svgPublishedMinified
  Scenario: an SVG from input/images is published minified, and its include copy is left as given
    Given an IG whose input/images holds a drawing saved with Visio's records, at the top level and in a subdirectory
    When it is staged as a site
    Then both published copies hold the drawing without the editor's records or the whitespace between tags
    And the copy under _includes is the IG's file as given
    And the stage reports two SVGs minified and the bytes saved

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::staging_one_IG_as_one_just-the-docs_site::unparseableDataNotPublished
  Scenario: a data file that does not parse is not published, and is reported
    Given the example IG staged as a site
    Then the good .jsonld is published and the broken .jsonld and broken demo JSON are not
    And 2 unparseable files are reported, "broken.jsonld" then "demo/broken.json"

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::staging_one_IG_as_one_just-the-docs_site::unrenderedDiagramIsMarker
  Scenario: a diagram the Publisher renders, with no renderer given, is a VISIBLE marker and reported
    Given the example IG staged with no diagram renderer
    Then "flow.svg" is reported as not rendered and nothing as rendered
    And its include holds the visible marker "⟦not rendered: flow.svg⟧"

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::staging_one_IG_as_one_just-the-docs_site::configIsJustTheDocsAtBaseurl
  Scenario: the config is one just-the-docs site at the given baseurl
    Given the example IG staged as a site
    Then its _config.yml has the title "Example IG", the baseurl "/site/example" and the theme just-the-docs

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::staging_one_IG_as_one_just-the-docs_site::includeTargetsWithLangFragment
  Scenario: include targets are read from the page, including lang-fragment
    Given a page with two include tags and a lang-fragment tag
    Then the include targets are "a.svg", "b.md" and "table.xhtml"

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::staging_one_IG_as_one_just-the-docs_site::dedupeIdsRenamesRepeats
  Scenario: a repeated id keeps its first copy and the rest are renamed, each reported
    Given HTML that repeats the id "x" three times
    When ids are de-duplicated
    Then the first keeps "x" and the others become "x--2" and "x--3"
    And both renames are reported

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::staging_one_IG_as_one_just-the-docs_site::noPaletteNoScheme
  Scenario: with no palette there is no scheme, and the report says so
    Given the example IG staged with no palette
    Then no scheme is reported
    And _config.yml sets no color_scheme

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_instance's_palette_as_a_just-the-docs_colour_scheme::wcagContrastPerSpec
  Scenario: WCAG contrast is computed as the spec defines it
    Then black on white has a contrast of 21
    And "#fff" on white has a contrast of 1
    And a named colour has no computable contrast

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_instance's_palette_as_a_just-the-docs_colour_scheme::rolesLandOnSchemeVars
  Scenario: each role lands on the scheme variable just-the-docs reads
    When the palette is turned into a colour scheme
    Then its SCSS sets the feedback, body background, body text, link, border and sidebar colours from the palette roles

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_instance's_palette_as_a_just-the-docs_colour_scheme::sidebarTextMoreContrastRole
  Scenario: sidebar text is the palette role with more contrast on accent, never a literal
    Given a dark accent
    Then the sidebar text is the "surface" role and child links use the surface colour
    Given a light accent
    Then the sidebar text is the "ink" role

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_instance's_palette_as_a_just-the-docs_colour_scheme::lowContrastIsFinding
  Scenario: a pairing below AA, or one that cannot be computed, is a finding
    Then the palette has no findings
    And an accent "#999999" gives a finding for accent on surface (links)
    And a named accent gives a finding saying it is not computable

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_instance's_palette_as_a_just-the-docs_colour_scheme::paletteSelectsScheme
  Scenario: a staged site with a palette selects the scheme and ships its files
    When the IG is staged with a palette
    Then the scheme's sidebar text is "surface"
    And _config.yml selects "color_scheme: ig"
    And the scheme and custom SCSS files are written with the palette's values

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::pages_the_Publisher_generates,_written_from_data_the_build_holds_(bean_jut3)::tocNestsAndLinksExisting
  Scenario: toc lists every page in the tree, nested, and links only pages that exist
    When a TOC is written for a nested page tree where the artifacts page does not exist
    Then it links Home with Overview nested under it
    And it names Artifacts as generated by the IG Publisher and not part of this build, with no link

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::pages_the_Publisher_generates,_written_from_data_the_build_holds_(bean_jut3)::tocAlwaysGenerated
  Scenario: a staged site always gets a toc, reported as generated rather than as a source page
    Given the example IG staged as a site
    Then "toc.md" is reported as generated and not as a source page
    And it links the Change Log page

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::pages_the_Publisher_generates,_written_from_data_the_build_holds_(bean_jut3)::artifactVariablesKeepFamilies
  Scenario: the lifted variables keep generate_smart_liquid's families and keys, minus the smart__ prefix
    Given a categorised ValueSet and an uncategorised Endpoint
    When the artifact variables are lifted
    Then the ValueSet's page, canonical and JSON urls, display text, escaped label, link and elements are set
    And 1 artefact is listed, in the one category "Terminology"
    And an absent description is an empty cell
    And the Endpoint has variables
    And "status" is reported as not sourced and no artefact has a status element

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::pages_the_Publisher_generates,_written_from_data_the_build_holds_(bean_jut3)::artifactsTemplateRendersLiquid
  Scenario: the artifacts TEMPLATE renders the variables through real Liquid
    Given the artifact variables of one ValueSet whose description has a pipe and a line break
    When the artifacts template is rendered through Ruby Liquid
    Then nothing is written to stderr
    And it says "1 artefact(s)." and has one collapsed section for "Terminology: Value Sets" with a count of 1
    And the section holds a Name and Description table with the escaped link and description on one line

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::pages_the_Publisher_generates,_written_from_data_the_build_holds_(bean_jut3)::artifactsTemplateOpensWithComment
  Scenario: the artifacts template is a file that opens with the comment describing it
    Given the artifacts template file
    Then it starts with a Liquid comment
    And it uses no plus, minus, size or replace filter

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::pages_the_Publisher_generates,_written_from_data_the_build_holds_(bean_jut3)::noIndexNoArtifactsPage
  Scenario: without an index there is no artifacts page, and the menu still reports it missing
    Given the example IG staged with no artifact index
    Then no artifacts page is written or reported as generated

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::post-processing_fills:_content_a_step_writes_after_the_Publisher,_at_a_marker_the_source_holds::fillReplacesMarker
  Scenario: the marker is replaced, the data reaches the page's front matter, and an unused fill is reported
    Given a page holding a marker and two fills, one for that marker and one for a marker nowhere
    When the IG is staged
    Then the page's front matter holds the fill's data
    And the fill body replaces the marker
    And the fill reports the page as filled and the other marker as unused

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_releases_page:_pointers_to_release_binaries,_never_the_bytes_(bean_b8ip)::sizeLabels
  Scenario: sizes are labelled as a reader reads them
    Then 915317 bytes is "915 KB", 13864960 bytes is "13.9 MB" and 10 bytes is "1 KB"

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_releases_page:_pointers_to_release_binaries,_never_the_bytes_(bean_b8ip)::releaseVariablesComputed
  Scenario: every value the template shows is computed here
    When the release variables are computed
    Then the first release is "v1.0.0", published 2026-03-23, not a prerelease
    And its assets are package.tgz at 915 KB with a digest and package.db at 13.9 MB with none

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_releases_page:_pointers_to_release_binaries,_never_the_bytes_(bean_b8ip)::releasesPageOnlyWhenGiven
  Scenario: given releases, the page and its data are written and reported as generated; absent, neither is
    When the IG is staged with releases
    Then "releases.md" is reported as generated and holds the releases template
    And the releases data file equals the release variables
    When the IG is staged without releases
    Then no releases page is reported and no releases data file is written

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_local_template's_includes::localTemplateFromIgIni
  Scenario: found from ig.ini's #<dir>, and not from a commented line, a package template or a path
    Given ig.ini files with a local template, a commented local template, a template path, and a local template whose directory is missing
    Then only the first gives the local template's includes directory

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_local_template's_includes::relinkTemplatedArtifactLinks
  Scenario: a templated link to an artefact page is pointed at this site's copy, for a type with pages only
    Given templated links to Requirements and CapabilityStatement pages, a templated link to another type and a literal link
    When templated artefact links are relinked for the types with pages
    Then 2 links are pointed at this site's artifact pages and the others are unchanged

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_local_template's_includes::localIncludesStagedRelinked
  Scenario: staged into _includes under the IG's own, relinked, and no longer a marker
    Given an IG whose ig.ini names a local template with two includes, one of which the IG also has
    When the IG is staged with a Requirements artefact
    Then 2 template includes are staged from local-template/includes
    And the summary include is not reported as not rendered and its artefact link points at this site
    And the IG's own copy of the shared include wins
    And the stage description names the 2 local template includes

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::relinkArtifacts::relinkArtifactsOnlyArtefactPages
  Scenario: rewrites a markdown link and an href to an artefact page, and nothing else
    Given markdown and HTML links to artefact pages, a concept page, an absolute URL and a subdirectory path
    When artefact links are relinked
    Then 3 links are rewritten to the artifact directory and the rest are unchanged

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::relinkArtifacts::relinkArtifactsNoOp
  Scenario: is a no-op when the source links no artefact
    Then a source that links no artefact is unchanged with a count of 0

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::copyDocsInto_(an_igSite_instance's_pages_built_into_its_IG_site)::copyDocsSkipsReadmeNoOverwrite
  Scenario: copies every file but the README, and refuses to overwrite one the IG site wrote
    Given a docs directory with a README, an artifact page and an artifacts page the IG site already wrote
    When the docs are copied into the IG site
    Then 1 file is copied and "artifacts.md" is a collision
    And the artifact page is copied, the IG site's artifacts page is kept and the README is not copied

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::copyDocsInto:_a_front-matter-only_page_declares_something_ABOUT_a_generated_page::frontMatterOnlyMergesOntoGenerated
  Scenario: its keys land on the generated page's front matter, the page's own keys winning
    Given a front-matter-only docs page for the generated artifacts page, and one for a page that does not exist
    When the docs are copied into the IG site
    Then "artifacts.md" is merged and the other is a collision with no generated page
    And the generated page keeps its own title and parent and gains the docs page's other key

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::igSiteDocs::onlyDeclaredIgSiteBuilds
  Scenario: only an instance that DECLARES igSite builds its IG site at its root
    Then instances that declare igSite build their IG site from their docs directory
    And a docs directory that does not declare igSite, or no docs directory, gives none

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::webpagePalette_inherits_along_needs_(bean_`mftp`)::paletteInheritedAlongNeeds
  Scenario: an instance that declares no theme wears the nearest one along its needs, through one that declares none
    Given an instance that declares no theme and needs one that does, through one that declares none
    Then its palette accent is "#0066aa" and the note says it is inherited from base
    And the base's own note does not say inherited

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::webpagePalette_inherits_along_needs_(bean_`mftp`)::noThemeNoPalette
  Scenario: with no theme anywhere along its needs, there is no palette, and the note says why
    Given an instance with no theme anywhere along its needs
    Then it has no palette and the note says there is no webpage theme

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::every_IG_site:_the_IG's_top_bar,_and_its_TOC_declared_for_the_navbar::tocNavDeclaration
  Scenario: the TOC is a visualiser declaration the navbar reads, rows under each group, hrefs under the baseurl
    When the TOC navigation is declared for a menu under a baseurl with an extra TOC row
    Then it is a JSON script the navbar reads
    And its rows are the groups with their items under the baseurl, an absolute href unchanged, and the Table of Contents row

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::every_IG_site:_the_IG's_top_bar,_and_its_TOC_declared_for_the_navbar::topBarDropdownNotFolioNav
  Scenario: the top bar is one dropdown per group, and never reads as the folio navbar
    When the top bar is written for a menu
    Then it has a dropdown summary "Home" with links under the baseurl
    And it has no folio navbar class or site-nav id

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::every_IG_site:_the_IG's_top_bar,_and_its_TOC_declared_for_the_navbar::pageEntryIsLink
  Scenario: a top-level entry that is a page (`Home: index.html`) is a link in the bar and the TOC, with no section page
    Given a menu whose Home and Artifacts entries are pages and whose Logic entry is a group
    Then the bar shows Home and Artifacts as links and has no plain group label
    And the TOC rows for Home and Artifacts are links under the baseurl
    When an IG is staged with that menu
    Then no section page is written for Home or Artifacts, and one is written for Logic

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::every_IG_site:_the_IG's_top_bar,_and_its_TOC_declared_for_the_navbar::titleLineThenMenu
  Scenario: the title sits on its own line, the menu on the line below (owner, 2026-10-14)
    When the top bar is written
    Then the title comes before every group
    And the bar wraps and the title takes the whole first line

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::every_IG_site:_the_IG's_top_bar,_and_its_TOC_declared_for_the_navbar::folioTabRowAtEveryWidth
  Scenario: the Folio tab gets the bar's top row to itself, at every width (folio-assistant#2534)
    Then the top bar CSS reserves its top row with padding when the Folio tab is present
    And that reservation is not inside a media query

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::every_IG_site:_the_IG's_top_bar,_and_its_TOC_declared_for_the_navbar::chromeLayoutNoSidebar
  Scenario: a harness-chrome site has a layout with no sidebar of its own
    Given an IG staged with a menu
    Then its default layout carries the navbar declaration and the top bar
    And it has no site-nav sidebar
    And it carries the visualiser label "X IG"

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_Publisher's_page_footer_on_the_IG_site's_own_pages_(#1901)::footerFactsPackageFirst
  Scenario: the facts come from the package first, then the IG's source; links only to what is held
    Given an IG staged with footer facts from its package
    Then the footer names the publisher and url, package id, the package's version "0.2.1", FHIR 5.0.0 and its url, the generated date, copyright year, scope and stylesheets
    And its links are only the Table of Contents and the external License

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_Publisher's_page_footer_on_the_IG_site's_own_pages_(#1901)::prevNextFollowTocOrder
  Scenario: prev and next follow the IG's table-of-contents order, skipping what is not built
    Given an IG staged with a menu that lists a page that is not built
    Then the first page has the footer, no previous link and the next link "concepts.html"
    And the concepts page links back to "index.html" and on to "changes.html", skipping the missing page
    And the last page has no next link
    And the generated TOC page has the footer and no previous link
    And the layout includes the footer last in main, only where the page asks, and the footer include exists

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_Publisher's_page_footer_on_the_IG_site's_own_pages_(#1901)::noMenuFooterInPage
  Scenario: without a menu there is no generated layout, so the footer goes into the page
    Given an IG staged with no menu
    Then the concepts page ends by including the footer

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_Publisher's_page_footer_on_the_IG_site's_own_pages_(#1901)::composedFooterNamespaced
  Scenario: composed into a host site, the footer include is namespaced and gated by the page
    Given an IG staged with a menu and composed into a host site with full pages
    Then there are no collisions
    And the composed page includes the namespaced footer only where the page asks
    And the namespaced footer include reads the IG's own footer data

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::the_Publisher's_page_footer_on_the_IG_site's_own_pages_(#1901)::footerTemplateRendersLiquid
  Scenario: the footer TEMPLATE renders the Publisher's three rows through real Liquid
    Given a footer with all its facts and two links
    When the footer template is rendered through Ruby Liquid with previous and next pages
    Then nothing is written to stderr
    And it links the stylesheet and opens the footer with the scope class
    And it shows prev, top and next links
    And it shows the copyright, publisher, package and FHIR version line
    And it lists the links, the external one marked external
    When it is rendered with no previous or next page
    Then the navigation row holds only the top link

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::a_path_a_later_site_step_writes_is_left_to_it::reservedPrefixNotPublished
  Scenario: input/images files under a reserved prefix are not published, and are reported
    Given image files under "openapi/", an image named "openapi.png" and a "demo" subdirectory
    When the IG is staged with "openapi/" reserved for a later step
    Then nothing is published under "openapi"
    And "openapi.png" and the demo file are published
    And the two reserved files are reported with the step that writes them
    And the stage description says a later step writes 2 files

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::a_reserved_FILE_leaves_the_rest_of_its_directory_to_the_IG::reservedFileOnlyWithheld
  Scenario: only the named file is withheld; the IG's other files at that route publish
    Given two files in the "openapi" image subdirectory
    When the IG is staged with only "openapi/api.openapi.json" reserved
    Then the other file in that directory is published
    And the reserved file is not published and is reported

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::a_link_into_a_subdirectory_of_input/images_stays_on_the_site::imageSubdirLinkStaysOnSite
  Scenario: it is served, so it is not relinked to the source
    Given a page linking a stylesheet in an image subdirectory, and an edit base
    When the IG is staged
    Then the page's markdown link and href are unchanged
    And the stylesheet is published

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::edit_links_to_the_IG's_own_source_(bean_`mftp`)::pagecontentHasEditUrl
  Scenario: a pagecontent page carries its edit URL, a generated page none
    Given an IG staged with an edit base on GitHub
    Then the concepts page carries its edit URL and the generated TOC page none
    And the layout offers "Edit this page on GitHub" and opts the main content into figure images
    And the layout carries the source-lines element, the block URL function and the edit link marker
    And the concepts page names its source repository, branch, path and blob URL

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::sourceHeadings:_each_section's_line_in_the_IG's_source_(bean_`mftp`)::sourceHeadingsWithLines
  Scenario: ATX headings with their 1-based line, text as a reader sees it, fences skipped
    Given markdown with a heading with an id, a heading inside a code fence, a heading with a link and bold, and a closed heading
    Then the headings are "Title" at line 1, "A link and bold" at line 7 and "Last" at line 8

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::heading_links_on_an_IG's_first_page,_whose_headings_live_in_an_include_(bean_`x78e`)::includeHeadingsLinkToInclude
  Scenario: index.md that only includes index-ig.md: each heading's source line is its own line in the include
    Given a first page that only includes another markdown page holding three headings
    When the IG is staged with an edit base
    Then the page's source lines are the three headings at lines 8, 11 and 15 of the include
    And the layout hands those lines to the page as ig-source-lines data
    And nothing is appended to a heading's text: the shared edit-links runtime draws the links in the right gutter

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::heading_links_on_an_IG's_first_page,_whose_headings_live_in_an_include_(bean_`x78e`)::includeCycleEnds
  Scenario: an include cycle ends, and a non-markdown include is not read
    Given two markdown includes that include each other, one of which also includes an xhtml file
    Then the headings are A and B from their includes and the page's own heading at line 2

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::composeIgSite:_a_staged_IG_moved_into_a_host_Jekyll_source::composeNestsAndNamespaces
  Scenario: pages nest under the IG, includes and data are namespaced, chrome is injected (--full-pages)
    Given an IG staged with a two-group menu and composed into a host site with full pages
    Then there are no collisions
    And the index page is titled "X IG" with children, reads the namespaced data and includes the top and bottom chrome
    And the concepts page sits under "Business" and "X IG", uses the default layout and the namespaced include
    And the group page sits under "X IG"
    And the includes and data are under the IG's namespace and the top include holds the top bar and the figure images stamp
    And the figure images stamp uses the attribute the site chrome's script reads
    And no config or layouts are copied under the IG
    And composing the same IG again collides
    When the IG is composed at the root
    Then there are no collisions and the pages are at the root with no IG directory, while the includes stay namespaced

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::composeIgSite:_a_staged_IG_moved_into_a_host_Jekyll_source::hostBaseIsLiquidBaseurl
  Scenario: the host's base reaches the composed top bar and section as {{ site.baseurl }}, not as one deploy's path
    Given an IG staged under a branch's staging base and composed into a host at "ig"
    Then there are no collisions
    And the thin layout and top include do not name the branch and use the site baseurl in links
    And the pages land under "x/ig" and not at "x"

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::composeIgSite:_a_staged_IG_moved_into_a_host_Jekyll_source::composedAtInstanceCarriesStylesheet
  Scenario: an IG composed at /<instance>/ lands there and carries the thin stylesheet its layout links
    Given an IG composed at "."
    Then there are no collisions
    And the pages land at "x" with no "x/ig" directory, and the thin stylesheet is copied
    And the thin layout links that stylesheet and uses the site baseurl

  @test:scripts/build-ig-site.test.ts::composeIgSite:_a_staged_IG_moved_into_a_host_Jekyll_source::liquidSiteBaseQuotedOnly
  Scenario: liquidSiteBase: only a quoted value starting with the base, and never a sibling path
    Then a quoted href starting with the base is rewritten to the site baseurl, a sibling path and a bare string are not
    And a JSON href starting with the base is rewritten
