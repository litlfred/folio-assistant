/**
 * The IG API VIEW pages — the Publisher's `<Name>.schema.json.html` and
 * `<Name>.jsonld.html` — and the IG API hub, as data for Liquid templates
 * (bean `jut3`, P0).
 *
 * An IG's post-processing may publish machine-readable sidecars per artefact
 * (JSON Schema, displays, OpenAPI, JSON-LD) and a hub page listing them; two
 * of them a reader can open as a page. The Publisher's page for each is a tab
 * bar, a heading, Raw and Download links, and the file. This module computes
 * the page's data; `templates/ig-api-view.liquid` arranges it and Jekyll
 * renders it (`liquid-templates`: computation in the generator, layout in the
 * template). The file itself is fetched in the browser by
 * `templates/ig-api-view.js`, as the Publisher's page does — never baked into
 * the page (bean `680p`).
 *
 * **Generic by construction, and named so (bean `d313`).** Every name here
 * once said which overlay publishes these sidecars today — which, in a layer
 * whose one rule is that it knows nothing of the layers above it, put one
 * overlay's name on a surface any IG may publish. What is an overlay's is now
 * configuration its instances pass: the label (`--sidecar-label`), the hub
 * page's name and markers (ingest flags), and the source placeholder
 * (recorded on the index's `igApiHub.placeholder`). Rendering is still driven entirely by
 * `a.sidecars` being present, so an IG that publishes none gets none of it.
