/**
 * Stage every IG whose instance records its source, one Jekyll site each
 * (bean `bamf`).
 *
 * An instance that ingested a published IG's navigation holds
 * `fhir-artifact-index/menu.json` (`folio-ig-menu/v1`), and that file records
 * WHERE the menu was read: `source.of` (the IG repository) and `source.ref`
 * (the commit). That pair is the declared source, so no workflow names an IG:
 * this clones `of` at `ref`, stages it with `build-ig-site` using the IG's own
 * menu, and prints one `<instance> <jekyll source> <at>` line per IG for the
 * caller to build into `<site>/<instance>/<at>/` ({@link igSiteAt}) — `ig`
 * beside the instance's own pages, or `.` when there are none (#2738) or
 * when the instance's docs directory declares `igSite`
 * (bean `mftp`): the IG site is then the instance's root, and the docs
 * directory's pages (artefact pages, their assets) are copied into its
 * Jekyll source to build under the IG's own menu. One site, one menu, as the
 * Publisher builds one.
 *
 * An instance with no menu, or a menu with no sushi-config source, is skipped
 * and reported: nothing to build is not the same as a build that failed.
 *
 * The site wears the palette of the ONE `webpage` theme the instance declares
 * (bean `u3cd`), resolved through `instanceThemes` — the same answer every
 * other generator reads, so the palette has one home. None declared builds
 * with just-the-docs' default scheme and says so; two declared is refused,
 * because nothing says which one dresses the IG.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run fhir-harness/scripts/stage-ig-sites.ts --work <dir> --baseurl <site baseurl> \
 *     [--plantuml-jar <jar>] [--remote-theme <owner/repo@ref>] [--changed-files <file>]
 *
 * `--changed-files` (one path per line) builds only the IGs the staging cone
 * reaches (bean `4j86`); each decision is printed with its reason.
 *
 * `--compose-into <docs source>` moves each staged IG INTO the host site's
 * Jekyll source at `<docs source>/<instance>/` (`composeIgSite`), so the
 * host's own build renders it with the host's chrome — sidebar, search,
 * language selector — rather than as a site of its own (bean `mftp`, owner:
 * "Build in main site"). The build list is still printed, for the per-IG
 * duplicate-id pass after the host's build.
 *
 * THIN BY DEFAULT (owner, 2026-10-12: "make thin default"): `artifacts.html`
 * and `toc.html` are thin pages over the artefact index node, and pages
 * composed into a host wear the thin layout (`thinIgLayout`) with the host's
 * chrome linked, not inlined. `--full-pages` builds the earlier full pages; it
 * needs `gen-ig-pages --full-pages` too, and a mismatch is refused.
 *
 * `--only <instance> --source <dir>` builds ONE IG from a local checkout of
 * its source instead of cloning the recorded commit — what an IG's own
 * repository runs in its CI, so the site is built from the commit being
 * pushed (bean `mftp`, owner 2026-10-05: *"build on the fork"*). The menu,
 * index and artefact pages still come from the instance's declaration here.
 *
 * @covers none — a build step: it stages sites and judges no declared graph
 *
 * @module fhir-harness/scripts/stage-ig-sites
