Feature: The IG's quality checks page

  @test:scripts/ig-qa-page.test.ts::ig-qa-page::fhirQaSummaryFromAst
  Scenario: FHIR QA: the Publisher's summary when the AST carries it, its counts and its record
    Given an AST holding the Publisher's QA summary (3 errors, 7 warnings, 0 hints, IG Publisher 2.0.15, FHIR 5.0.0) and its manifest
    When the FHIR QA section is written
    Then it names the Publisher and FHIR versions and the date
    And it shows the errors and hints counts, says nothing of suppressed messages, and links the record at assets/fhir-qa/qa.json
    And it shows when the AST was generated and which parts are provisional until a full IG Publisher run

  @test:scripts/ig-qa-page.test.ts::ig-qa-page::fhirQaWithoutSummarySaysSo
  Scenario: FHIR QA: an AST without the summary says so, never zeros
    Given an AST with a manifest but no QA summary, and a validity record saying the AST is stale because the inputs changed
    When the FHIR QA section is written
    Then it says the AST holds no Publisher QA summary and shows no errors count
    And it shows the validity "stale" with its reason, and the recorded and current input digests side by side

  @test:scripts/ig-qa-page.test.ts::ig-qa-page::pageRawHalvesKgRecords
  Scenario: the page: both halves inside raw, the KG records laid out by the harness's renderer
    Given one instance's directory holding a knowledge-graph QA record with two findings
    When the QA page is rendered
    Then its front matter titles it "QA Report" and keeps it out of the navigation
    And the FHIR QA section comes before the knowledge-graph QA section, both inside a raw block that the page ends with
    And it links every instance's QA, names the record's two findings and its writer, and links the record file
    And a pipe in a summary is escaped and Liquid-looking text in an entry is shown as written

  @test:scripts/ig-qa-page.test.ts::ig-qa-page::publisherLayoutFromTheMessageList
  Scenario: FHIR QA: the Publisher's full message list, laid out as its own qa.html
    Given an AST holding the Publisher's QA summary and its message list: one build message, and a file with an error at line 12, column 4 and a hint
    When the FHIR QA section is written
    Then it carries a panel that loads the summary and the message list, and the page script beside them, in place of the counts table
    When the page script draws the panel
    Then it shows "Validation Results for" the IG, its FHIR version, package and version, and the summary "errors = 1, warn = 1, info = 1, broken links = 0"
    And a file table with Filename, Errors, Warnings and Hints, the build's own messages as "Build Errors"
    And each file's messages under Path, Severity and Message, the path with its line and column, and the message id
    And it links as far as the site allows: the IG's package to its page, each file to its artifact page and, when tracked, its source at the built commit, each of the IG's canonical URLs in a message to its page, any other URL to itself, and each file section back to the file table
