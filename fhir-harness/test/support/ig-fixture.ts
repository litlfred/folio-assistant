/**
 * A non-WHO implementation guide to test fhir-harness against.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `ig-build-pipeline.md` §"What this layer refuses to know about" says
 * fhir-harness names no WHO IG, and `check:fhir-harness-exclusions` enforces
 * it. This layer's tests used to borrow the committed `smart-base` and
 * `smart-trust` instances as sample data, so the layer's own suite was the
 * place it knew most about WHO (#1963). The assertions are kept. Only the
 * subject changes: the IG here is shaped like HL7's International Patient
 * Summary. The checks that were really about the COMMITTED WHO pages moved to
 * `smart-base/scripts/ig-pages-committed.test.ts`, which is allowed to know
 * them.
 *
 * ## What the values are
 *
 * The package id, canonical, FHIR version and profile id are IPS's real
 * public identifiers (`hl7.fhir.uv.ips`, `http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips`, R4,
 * `Composition-uv-ips`). Nothing else is a transcription: the version, the
 * build time and the artefact list were made up for the test, and so is the
 * "Example Template" chrome. Do not read any of it as a statement about the
 * published IPS.
 *
