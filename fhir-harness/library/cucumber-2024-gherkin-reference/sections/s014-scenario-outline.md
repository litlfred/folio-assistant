## Scenario Outline

The `Scenario Outline` keyword can be used to run the same `Scenario` multiple times,
with different combinations of values.

The keyword `Scenario Template` is a synonym of the keyword `Scenario Outline`.

Copying and pasting scenarios to use different values quickly becomes tedious and repetitive:

```gherkin
Scenario: eat 5 out of 12
  Given there are 12 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 7 cucumbers

Scenario: eat 5 out of 20
  Given there are 20 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 15 cucumbers
```

We can collapse these two similar scenarios into a `Scenario Outline`.

Scenario outlines allow us to more concisely express these scenarios through the use
of a template with `< >`-delimited parameters:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: eating
  Given there are <start> cucumbers
  When I eat <eat> cucumbers
  Then I should have <left> cucumbers

  Examples:
    | start | eat | left |
    |    12 |   5 |    7 |
    |    20 |   5 |   15 |
```
