## Background

Occasionally you'll find yourself repeating the same `Given` steps in all of the scenarios in a `Feature`.

Since it is repeated in every scenario, this is an indication that those steps
are not *essential* to describe the scenarios; they are *incidental details*. You can literally move such `Given` steps to the background, by grouping them under a `Background` section.

A `Background` allows you to add some context to the scenarios that follow it. It can contain one or more `Given` steps, which are run before *each* scenario, but after any [Before hooks](/docs/cucumber/api/#hooks).

A `Background` is placed before the first `Scenario`/`Example`, at the same level of indentation.

For example:

```gherkin
Feature: Multiple site support
  Only blog owners can post to a blog, except administrators,
  who can post to all blogs.

  Background:
    Given a global administrator named "Greg"
    And a blog named "Greg's anti-tax rants"
    And a customer named "Dr. Bill"
    And a blog named "Expensive Therapy" owned by "Dr. Bill"

  Scenario: Dr. Bill posts to his own blog
    Given I am logged in as Dr. Bill
    When I try to post to "Expensive Therapy"
    Then I should see "Your article was published."

  Scenario: Dr. Bill tries to post to somebody else's blog, and fails
    Given I am logged in as Dr. Bill
    When I try to post to "Greg's anti-tax rants"
    Then I should see "Hey! That's not your blog!"

  Scenario: Greg posts to a client's blog
    Given I am logged in as Greg
    When I try to post to "Expensive Therapy"
    Then I should see "Your article was published."
```

`Background` is also supported at the `Rule` level, for example:

```gherkin
Feature: Overdue tasks
  Let users know when tasks are overdue, even when using other
  features of the app

  Rule: Users are notified about overdue tasks on first use of the day
    Background:
      Given I have overdue tasks

    Example: First use of the day
      Given I last used the app yesterday
      When I use the app
      Then I am notified about overdue tasks

    Example: Already used today
      Given I last used the app earlier today
      When I use the app
      Then I am not notified about overdue tasks
  ...
```

You can only have one set of `Background` steps per `Feature` or `Rule`. If you need different `Background` steps for different scenarios, consider breaking up your set of scenarios into more `Rule`s or more `Feature`s.

For a less explicit alternative to `Background`, check out [conditional hooks](/docs/cucumber/api/#conditional-hooks).
