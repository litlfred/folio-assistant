/**
 * The `ig-publisher-service` role held to its contract,
 * `skills/content/fhir-ig-authoring/ig-publisher-service-contract.md`.
 *
 * Each `describe` quotes one numbered line of "What it must do" and checks it
 * against what this repository declares about the Actor that plays the role:
 * its actor file, the ODRL grant it holds, its two capabilities, and the
 * requirement statement the publisher capability says it satisfies.
 *
 * What cannot run here, and is therefore not claimed: the services
 * themselves. They run in a folio's build, in the image the actor names, not
 * in this repository (the contract's closing paragraph), so a build, a QA
 * report and a validation are held at the level of what the declarations
 * promise and demand.
