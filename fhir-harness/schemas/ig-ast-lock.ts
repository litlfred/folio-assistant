/**
 * `ig-ast.lock.json` (`ig-ast-lock/v1`): the AST cache commit each IG's
 * artefact index is built from, pinned like a layer (bean fwtz, owner's
 * Q-S2-1 answer A, 2026-11-01).
 *
 * A checkout that holds this file next to its `index.lock.json` builds each
 * pinned IG's index from that commit of the IG's AST cache branch, fetched by
 * sha, and never from the branch tip. A re-pin is a reviewed change to this
 * file, with the owner's consent recorded beside the pin, the same as a layer
 * re-pin in `index.config.json`. An IG with no pin here is read as before
 * (the tip), and the build log says so.
