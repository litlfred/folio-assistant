/**
 * ig-annexes.ts — the annexes an IG's pages load on demand, declared in an
 * `ig-annex` directory's `annexes.json`.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-10: the data dictionary belongs on its page as an annex held
 * in the knowledge graph and loaded dynamically, not as the full workbook
 * (option 2a). This layer knows only the GENERIC contract: a page, a file
 * beside the declaration, and the columns a table shows before a row is
 * opened. What the file holds is the declaring layer's own kind, typed by
 * that layer's validators; `ig-annex.js` renders any `{ sheets: [...] }`
 * table, and a `.md` file is appended to its page as written.
 *
 * Read by `stage-ig-sites.ts` (`annexesIn`), for an index's IG sites and an
 * IG repository's own (`ig-repo-site.ts compose`).
 *
 * @graphNode schema
