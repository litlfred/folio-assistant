/**
 * ig-chrome.ts — a FHIR IG's published CHROME, as data.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The owner asked that our pages mirror the WHO IG's styling. `0818` shipped
 * the navigation and deliberately left this half open — *"the WHO visual
 * styling — blue bar, DRAFT watermark, yellow publish banner. A different
 * question from the menu"* — and it is a different question for a reason worth
 * stating before any of the code below makes sense.
 *
 * **A menu comes from ONE file. Chrome comes from a CHAIN.** An IG's
 * appearance is not declared anywhere in the IG. It is assembled by the IG
 * Publisher from a stack of `fhir.template` packages, each overriding the one
 * beneath it:
 *
 * ```
 *   smart-trust local-template  →  who.template.root 0.5.0  →  fhir.base.template 1.0.0
 * ```
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-23 from `local-template/package/package.json` and
 * `who-ig-template/package/package.json`, not assumed from the names.
 *
 * ## The finding that made a schema necessary rather than a stylesheet
 *
 * Of the three things the owner named, **only two are WHO's.** `who.css`
 * styles no `#publish-box` at all: `--publish-box-bg-color: yellow` and
 * `--publish-box-border: 1px solid #0A0008` are HL7's, at `project.css:64-65`,
 * inherited unchanged. So "mirror the WHO styling" mirrors HL7 for that one
 * item, and a reader of the result is entitled to know which organisation each
 * value came from. {@link IgChromeToken.from} is that answer, per token.
 *
 * ## An overlay is NOT a merge — one name can carry two TYPES
 *
 * `--toc-box-border` is `1px solid navy` in HL7 and **`navy`** in WHO. Both are
 * correct *in their own layer*: WHO's rules read it as a colour
 * (`who.css:499`, `border: 2px solid var(--toc-box-border)`) while HL7's read
 * it as a shorthand (`project.css:575`, `border: var(--toc-box-border)`). Put
 * the two layers together, as the IG Publisher actually does, and that HL7 rule
 * resolves to `border: navy` — which is not valid CSS.
 *
 * So a naive variable merge **ships a broken rule**, and it ships it silently,
 * because every individual layer parses. {@link IgChromeConflict} exists to
 * record that rather than resolve it: this repository is mirroring somebody
 * else's artefact, and quietly correcting their stylesheet would make our copy
 * a thing that renders differently from the original it claims to mirror. The
 * conflict is data; what to do about it is a person's call.
 *
 * ## It is INGESTED, never transcribed
 *
 * The same rule `0818` set for the menu and `wjfu` set for this corpus:
 * *"Generated from the KG, never transcribed."* Every value here is read out
 * of a template checkout at a named commit by `ingest-ig-chrome.ts`, and the
 * provenance is per LAYER because there is no single source to point at.
 *
 * ## v2: the chrome is the TEMPLATE's, not an IG's
 *
 * v1 also carried `id`, `canonical`, `status` and `version` from the IG it was
 * ingested beside. Every IG building with the same chain wears the same
 * chrome, so that identity became a claim about IGs it did not describe: the
 * one committed chrome sat in smart-base and said `smart.who.int.trust` 1.8.0,
 * `draft` (stage A, #1767). v2 is keyed by the chain's top layer, and an IG's
 * own identity and status are read into `ig-identity.json` beside its index
 * ({@link "./ig-identity"}). Stage D of the smart-* separation, bean `kg83`.
 *
 * @graphNode schema
 * @module schemas/ig-chrome

 * `malformed` is a single layer's value that is not valid CSS at all. The

 * a doubled `#` in HL7's own source. It matters because of how it presents
 * downstream: it appears in our generated page as `##555555`, looking exactly
 * like a bug in the ingest that copied it. **It cost the author of this ingest
 * about thirty seconds of believing they had written it**, with the source
 * open in the next terminal. A reader who does not have the source open has no

 * every reader at once.
 *
 * ## Why the instance is NAMED rather than walked to
 *
 * The owner placed the chrome at `smart-base` so every WHO SMART IG (through
 * `smart-ig`) inherits it instead of each re-copying it. The obvious
 * implementation is to walk `needs` from the consumer upward. When this was
 * written that did not work: `smart-trust` needed `smart-ig`, `smart-base`
 * needed `fhir-harness`, and there was no `needs` path between them.
 *
 * **That gap has since closed** — `smart-ig` now needs `smart-base`, so
 * smart-trust → smart-ig → smart-base resolves, and `check:derived-from`
 * resolves each IG page set's `derivedFrom: smart-base-themes` across it (bean
 * `nama`, measured 2026-10-04). The instance is still NAMED, for the other
 * reason: the generator is generic, and walking to "the nearest instance with
 * a chrome" would let the layout of a WHO stack decide what a non-WHO IG wears.
 * The caller names the owner; the declaration says which graph it reads.
