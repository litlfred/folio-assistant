/**
 * ig-menu.ts — a FHIR IG's own navigation, as data.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-23, with a screenshot of WHO SMART Trust's published top
 * bar: *"navar menu is now on LHS"*. The menu could not be rendered anywhere,
 * because it was **not held**: `smart-trust/fhir-artifact-index/index.json`
 * carries 674 artefacts harvested from gh-pages and no `menu`, and no raw HTML
 * was retained. Measured the same day, the twelve labels visible in that
 * screenshot matched **0 of 674** artefact titles — the harvest kept the IG's
 * FHIR artefacts and dropped both its navigation and the narrative pages that
 * navigation points at.
 *
 * `SushiConfigLogicalModel` already modelled the shape (`menu: array`,
 * *"Navigation menu structure for the IG"*, with `subItems`), so the schema was
 * never the gap. This is the gap: somewhere to put the data, with provenance.
 *
 * ## It is INGESTED, never transcribed
 *
 * The obvious shortcut was to type the menu out of the screenshot. Refused,
 * and the reason generalises past this case:
 *
 * - **A screenshot carries no hrefs.** Writing them means guessing URLs into a
 *   published artefact, and a guessed link is worse than an absent one — it
 *   resolves for a reader and lands somewhere nobody chose.
 * - **A closed dropdown and an empty menu look identical.** Three of the five
 *   were shut in that picture, so a capture made from it could not tell "this
 *   item has no children" from "the picture was taken with it closed". That is
 *   the `dh4f` distinction arriving at the point of capture rather than at the
 *   point of reporting.
 *
 * `wjfu` had already set the rule for this corpus: *"Generated from the KG,
 * never transcribed."*
 *
 * ## The provenance is a DIFFERENT source from the artefact index's
 *
 * `index.json` says `{kind: "gh-pages", of: <published site>}` — it is the
 * IG's OUTPUT. A menu comes from `sushi-config.yaml`, which is the IG's
 * SOURCE, in a git repository, at a commit. Two sources, two provenance
 * blocks, and folding the menu into `index.json` would give one file two
 * answers to "where did this come from".
