# AGENTS.md — fhir-harness

The **bare** FHIR IG pipeline: SUSHI → IG Publisher → Jekyll → a pages branch,
with no pre-processing and no post-processing. It serves any implementation
guide.

## The one rule

**Nothing here may know about WHO.** Not `dak.config.json`, not the DAK logical
model, not `smart.who.int` canonicals, not the DAK API's names or the
post-processing that produces it, not the pre/post-processing steps, and
nothing from the `authoring-who-smart-guidelines` package. **Rendering** the
sidecars an IG publishes is generic and is here, as the IG API
(`ig-api-views.ts`); a WHO instance passes the "DAK API" names in as
configuration.

The import direction is the enforceable half: the WHO package may reference
this layer, this layer may not reference it. A violation does not break the
build; it makes the layer unusable for a non-WHO IG. The refusal is written as
a checkable list in
[`skills/fhir-ig-base/ig-build-pipeline.md`](skills/fhir-ig-base/ig-build-pipeline.md).

**The gate is `bun run cat check:fhir-harness-exclusions`.** It is a ratchet
over a baseline of existing hits, and a new hit fails CI. The fix is to move
the WHO part up into the overlay, never to widen the baseline. The skill above
says what counts as a mention rather than a dependency.

## Where the layer sits

```
folio-assistant-core → fhir-harness → the WHO SMART Base IG (L1 and DAK document kinds) → smart-ig
```

An IG that wants the DAK surface does not change this pipeline: the DAK
document kind (`smart-dak`) of the WHO SMART Base IG supplies the pre/post
steps as an **overlay**, as `smart-l1` supplies the L1 kind. This layer must
not gain a `do_dak` flag: that would be this layer knowing about DAKs.

Placement:
[`smart-stack-layering`](https://github.com/litlfred/smart-base/blob/main/smart-base/skills/content/authoring-who-smart-guidelines/smart-stack-layering.md).

## What is here

The directories this layer declares are listed in `fhir-harness.json`:

- `skills/`: the skills listed below. Each package's `package-manifest.json`
  is the list of its skills.
- `scripts/`: the pipeline code (site build, IG indexes, IG ASTs through
  `scripts/ig-ast.ts`, the IG API), and `tools/`: a Tool node for each script
  the graph invokes.
- `processes/`: the BPMN of the FHIR IG pipeline; `scenarios/`: its roles,
  actors, stories and capabilities.
- `typologies/` and `validators/`: the kinds this layer owns and their
  validators; their schemas are in `schemas/`.
- `pipeline/` and `pipeline-plugins/`: the `site-publisher-ig` slot.
- `docs/`: this layer's pages on the platform's site (authored under
  `docs/source/`), plus the `ig-ast` wireframe.
- `library/`, `libraries/`, `translations/`, `glossary/`: source documents,
  outside libraries, gettext templates and the generated glossary.

A directory is declared only when it exists: a declared-but-absent directory
makes a consumer scan nothing and report a clean run over it.

## An IG repository declares nothing of this layer's

An IG repository that builds on this layer declares no `fhir-ast/`,
`fhir-artifact-index/` or docs directory of its own. It `needs` this layer, or
an overlay above it, and this layer supplies the rest from the AST on the
repository's own branch family: the site and the artefact index
([`ig-build-pipeline`](skills/fhir-ig-base/ig-build-pipeline.md), "The IG
repository's site route"; `ig-repo-site.ts`, `ast-to-artifact-index.ts`), and
its entry in the `ig-ast` viewer (`gen-ig-ast-pages.ts`), which it inherits
through `needs`. Its `fhir-artifact-index/` (index, menu, releases) is written
at publish by `ig-index:build` (`build-ig-indexes.ts`) from the same AST and
the IG's own `sushi-config.yaml`, so an IG instance commits none. **Read that
skill and the IG's own AGENTS.md before proposing a folder, page or
declaration for an IG.** An IG instance that still declares such directories
does so only because an index still mounts files it commits: an exception, not
a pattern to copy. The one directory an IG repository does declare for this
layer is an `ig-annex` directory of annexes its pages load on demand, data no
AST holds (the skill above, "Annexes an IG's pages load on demand").

## The skills this layer publishes

<!-- skills:index:begin -->

_17 skills in 3 directories, generated from each skill's front matter. `bun run cat readme:sync` rewrites this list and `readme:sync:check` fails when it is stale. Skills this repository inherits are listed by the repositories that publish them._

<!-- skills:index:end -->

`schemas/ig-content-type.ts` registers the `ig` content type. A repository
declares itself an IG source with `contentTypes.ig` in its root
`index.config.json`, not by carrying `sushi-config.yaml`. The section's
`include` lists the repository paths this layer reads, and a path not on that
list is not read: a harness reads only what it declares.

Every IG reader here asks `scripts/ig-read-scope.ts` before it touches a
path: `build-ig-indexes`, `ig-repo-site`, `build-ig-site`, `fsh-cone`,
`ingest-ig-menu`, `ingest-ig-chrome`, `ig-api-hub`, `ig-site-data`,
`ig-review-data` and `measure-logic-layer-edges`. A repository that declares
the section is read only within `include`; `ig-repo-site compose` and
`stageIgSite` stage from a copy of the declared paths. A repository that
declares none is a legacy IG: every path is readable, and one warning per run
names the missing section. A section with no usable `include` is refused.
To make a reader see a path it skips, add that path to `include` (a directory
ends in `/`) in the IG's own `index.config.json`, in the pull request that
needs it. The full rules, the warning's text and how to add a path are in
[`ig-build-pipeline`](skills/fhir-ig-base/ig-build-pipeline.md) §"What this
layer reads".
The input digest in `ig-ast.ts` does not use the read scope: it must match
the Java exporter, and it names what SUSHI and the Publisher read. The `ig` type is
registered at load time by `pipeline/plugin-slots.ts`, the module the
contributions loader requires for every repository that depends on this layer.
