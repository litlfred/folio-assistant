 * The Pages-address check of THIS repository's configuration, moved here from
 * `cat-harness/scripts/tests/getting-started.test.ts` (owner, 2026-10-06:
 * "Throwaway repository, plus moving the real-repo checks"). It expects this
 * checkout's `origin` to derive `https://litlfred.github.io/folio-assistant/`,
 * which is a fact about this repository rather than about the derivation:
 * standing alone, cat-harness has no `origin`, and the derivation itself is
 * asserted in that file over a throwaway repository. The path is composed from
 * ORIGIN_DIR, the directory the test was written in, so nothing it reads
 * changed.
