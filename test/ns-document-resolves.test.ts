/**
 * A layer's namespace DOCUMENT is published at the path its terms name.
 *
 * Every term hangs off a layer's namespace IRI — `fac:Catalogue` is
 * `…/folio-assistant-core/ns#Catalogue` — and the workflows publish one
 * document per layer so that IRI dereferences. The directory they publish
 * into was a LITERAL in a shell loop, and the IRI is a constant in
 * `schemas/namespaces.ts`. Nothing compared them.
 *
 * They drifted. #477 renamed the core instance from `folio-assist-core` to
 * `folio-assistant-core` and moved `CORE_NS` with it; both workflows kept
 * publishing to `_site/folio-assist-core/ns.jsonld`. So from that merge until
 * 2026-09-20, **every `fac:` term dereferenced to nothing** — the document sat
 * at a path no term named, and the path every term named had no document.
 *
 * `docs-site.yml` says the rule in its own comment — *"each of those is an IRI
 * stem, so each needs a document or `bs:Actor` dereferences to nothing — the
 * very defect this work exists to fix"* — and `ns-export.ts` asserts the
 * outcome outright: *"Every term lives in its layer's namespace … each of
 * which IS a file and dereferences."* Both were false for one of the three,
 * and no check read either claim.
 *
 * This is that comparison. It reads the loop out of the YAML rather than
 * restating the pairs, so a fourth layer is covered the day it is added.
 *
 * @module test/ns-document-resolves
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/` (bean `ho66`), as
 * `merge-guard-workflows.test.ts` was: every test in it reads the aggregate
 * repository's own root — `.github/workflows/docs-site.yml` and
 * `feature-staging.yml` — which a standalone cat-harness layer does not have,
 * and `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer.
 *
 * Moved again, from `cat-harness-tools/scripts/tests/` to the checkout's own
 * test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level
 * instance"): what it reads belongs to the whole checkout, which the root
 * instance declares, not to any one layer — so cat-harness-tools stays green
 * standing alone too.
