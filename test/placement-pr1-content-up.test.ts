/**
 * Placement PR1 (bean `ybwt`): the content-type skill packages moved UP out of
 * `cat-harness/skills/` to the instance that owns them, and the role edges
 * naming them moved with them as extensions by id (PR0b).
 *
 * Pinned against the live checkout, because the claim IS about this checkout:
 *
 * 1. every moved package is held by its owner, in a concern group there;
 * 2. the harness, resolved ALONE, holds none of their skills — and the
 *    checkout still knows every one (`knownSkills(checkout)` unchanged);
 * 3. `cat-harness/scenarios/roles.json` names none of them — each edge lives
 *    in the owner's `scenarios/roles.json` `extensions`, and the role resolved
 *    from the checkout still carries it.
 *
 * @module test/placement-pr1-content-up
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/placement-pr1-content-up.test.ts`
 * to the checkout's own test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling
 * 2026-10-06 "Top-level instance"): every test in it checks that content-type
 * packages sit in the instances above cat-harness that own them, which only
 * the whole checkout holds. Standing alone, cat-harness has none of it, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer. Paths are
 * composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory it was written in, so nothing it
 * reads changed.
