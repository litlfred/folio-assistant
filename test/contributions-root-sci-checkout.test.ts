/**
 * `contributions-root` tests whose subject is folio-assistant-sci's
 * contribution — the two cost checkers this instance contributes — moved here
 * from `cat-harness/content/pipeline/contributions-root.test.ts` (bean
 * `ho66`). The code under test is cat-harness's, imported DOWN; what it is
 * held against is this instance's, so standing alone cat-harness has nothing
 * for these to read. The rest of that file's tests stay there.
 *
 * Then moved up again, to the aggregate's `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling
 * 2026-10-06 "Top-level instance"): `contributionsRoot()` answers for the
 * RUNNING checkout, and only the aggregate's root depends on sci. Standing
 * alone, folio-assistant-sci is no folio that depends on itself
 * (`seed:ready --layer folio-assistant-sci --rehearse`, 2026-10-07).
