/**
 * `merge-guard.ts`'s deploy-only step, held against the staging workflow (bean `gnnj`).
 *
 * Check 5 does not refuse a Feature Staging run whose ONLY failed step is
 * `DEPLOY_ONLY_STEP`, so that string must be the name of the deploy step the
 * workflow really runs: renamed there and not here, the exemption would
 * silently stop matching and every give-up would block merges again. It lives
 * here rather than in `cat-harness/scripts/tests/merge-guard.test.ts` because a
 * standalone cat-harness layer has no workflows, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer.
 *
 * Check 5's dispatch parser joined it on 2026-10-06 for the same reason: it
 * is held against today's `merge-main.yml` (bean `ho66`).
 *
 * Moved again, from `cat-harness-tools/scripts/tests/` to the checkout's own
 * test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level
 * instance"): what it reads belongs to the whole checkout, which the root
 * instance declares, not to any one layer — so cat-harness-tools stays green
 * standing alone too.
