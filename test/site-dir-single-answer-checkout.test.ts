   * The guard above scans `.ts`/`.mjs`. `.gitignore` is neither, and it names
   * the site root **five times** — which is how the inversion broke it in both
   * directions at once, five hours after the repo last paid for exactly this.
   *
   * Measured 2026-09-19 on `daf19326c`, after `docs-site.yml` had already been
   * pointed at `./folio-assistant/docs`:
   *
   * - `!docs/assets/js/` no longer reached the moved tree, so the blanket
   *   `*.js` rule swallowed it. A NEW file under `<stub>/docs/assets/js/`
   *   would have been invisible to `git add` — the file's own comment records
   *   that happening before, verbatim: *"`git add` reported nothing and the
   *   file would simply never have deployed."*
   * - `docs/.bundle/` and `docs/vendor/` no longer reached it either, so the
   *   bundler's gem tree was unignored again. The same comment prices that at
   *   **3,080 files and 53 MB** that any `git add -A` would sweep into a
   *   commit.
   *
   * Neither was visible, and the reason is worth more than the fix: a working
   * tree that predates the move still HAS a `docs/`, holding build residue, so
   * the stale rules went on matching something. **A rule matching the wrong
   * thing reads exactly like a rule matching the right thing.**
   *
   * So this asserts the direction that actually matters — what git does to a
   * path — rather than the spelling. A rename of the stub flips these before
   * anyone can ship it, which is the point: `folio-assistant/` → `cat-harness/`
   * is the next move, and it walks straight back into this.
