/**
 * A memory entry's agent `references` name a declared subagent — held against

 * (bean `ho66`, owner ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level instance"). The subagents
 * are declared under the aggregate root's `.claude/agents/`, which a
 * standalone cat-harness does not hold, so there every reference read as
 * dangling. The roles half and the corpus checks stay there; the paths below
