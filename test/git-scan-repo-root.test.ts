 * `gitScan` over THIS checkout's corpus, moved here from

 * repository, plus moving the real-repo checks"). The pattern it reads — a
 * `manifest.jsonld` under any `library/<entry>/` — matches library entries in
 * every instance of the checkout, and the two-sided control below is about that real
 * corpus — what the old bare walk admitted, and that git's corpus loses none of
 * it. Standing alone, cat-harness's parent is not a repository, so git cannot
 * be asked there at all. `gitScan`'s logic stays in that file, over throwaway
 * repositories. The path is composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory the test
 * was written in, so nothing it reads changed.
