/**
 * `site-links` tests that read the aggregate repository's own root —
 * `.github/workflows/docs-site.yml` — moved here from
 * `cat-harness/scripts/tests/site-links.test.ts` (bean `ho66`), as
 * `merge-guard-workflows.test.ts` was: a standalone cat-harness layer has no
 * such root, and `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that
 * layer. The rest of that file's tests stay there.
 *
 * Moved again, from `cat-harness-tools/scripts/tests/` to the checkout's own
 * test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level
 * instance"): what it reads belongs to the whole checkout, which the root
 * instance declares, not to any one layer — so cat-harness-tools stays green
 * standing alone too.
