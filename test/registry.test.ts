/**
 * `scripts/generate-registry.ts` writes `.claude/skills/registry.json`, whose
 * contract is `SkillRegistrySchema`. Nothing ever checked that it satisfied it,
 * and it did not:
 *
 *   INVALID — 15 issues
 *     packages.0.repo  Required
 *     packages.0.path  Required
 *     packages.0.ref   Required   … × 5 packages
 *
 * The generator's own output type declared all six collections as `any[]`, so
 * `packages` was filled with `skills/<name>/package-manifest.json` files while
 * the schema asked for `SkillPackageRef` — a reference to an *external* package
 * in another repo. On top of that the generator never emitted
 * `roleAssignments` at all, though `.claude/scenarios/role-assignments.json`
 * has three rules in it and the field is required.
 *
 * This runs the generator and validates its output. It is the check whose
 * absence let a registry that could not be parsed ship as the framework's
 * machine-readable manifest.
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/registry.test.ts` to the
 * checkout's own test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06
 * "Top-level instance"): every test in it generates and reads the skill
 * registry at the aggregate root's `.claude/skills/`, from the root's
 * `.claude/scenarios/role-assignments.json`, which only the whole checkout
 * holds. Standing alone, cat-harness has none of it, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer. Paths are
 * composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory it was written in, so nothing it
 * reads changed.
