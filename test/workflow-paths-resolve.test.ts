/**
 * A path a PLATFORM workflow names must exist.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The `cat-harness` move (bean `wggr`) broke CI five times in a row, each time
 * a literal path in a workflow that no scan in this repository could see:
 * `find content …`, `cp -rT test/results/witnesses`, `bun run scripts/x.ts`,
 * a `bun -e` inline eval importing `./schemas/cat-harness.ts`, and a typedoc
 * entry-point list. Every one was found by pushing and reading a CI log, which
 * costs a round trip and only reports the FIRST failure in each job.
 *
 * `check:declared-paths` scans `.ts`. `site-dir-single-answer` scans `.ts` and
 * `.gitignore`. Neither reaches YAML, and YAML is where a path is most likely
 * to rot unnoticed: a workflow's outcome is invisible from a checkout, which
 * is the `xom7` defect this repository is named after having.
 *
 * ## Why it is scoped to a LIST of workflows rather than all of them
 *
 * Most workflows here are VENDORED BY FOLIOS. `lean_ci.yml` names
 * `folio/<paper>/lean/lakefile.toml`, `snappea_wasm.yml` names
 * `scripts/build-gmp.sh`, `wrapper-tests.yml` names `src/rust/` — none of
 * those exists here and none should. Asserting over them would demand that the
 * platform contain a folio's tree, which is the boundary this repository most
 * cares about keeping.
 *
 * So the list below is workflows that run THIS repository's own code. Adding
 * one is a deliberate act, and a workflow left off is simply unchecked — which
 * is a weaker guarantee honestly stated rather than a strong one that is false.
 *
 * ## This is NOT a duplicate of `check:workflow-paths`, and must not be merged into it
 *
 * The two look like one property stated twice, and they are not. Measured
 * 2026-09-20 by breaking each in turn and running both:
 *
 * | probe | this test | `check:workflow-paths` |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | a `cp` argument naming a missing dir, in an ALLOWLISTED workflow | **caught** | missed |
 * | `bun run scripts/does-not-exist.ts` in `publish.yml` (not allowlisted) | missed | **caught** |
 *
 * They are complementary on two orthogonal axes. This test covers **4
 * workflows** but **every path-shaped token on a line** — a `cp` argument, a
 * `paths:` filter entry, a typedoc entry list, a `bun -e` string — which is
 * where four of the five `wggr` failures actually lived.
 * `check:workflow-paths` covers **all 38 workflows** but only **script
 * invocations**, and models the cwd (job defaults, `working-directory`, `cd`,
 * `--cwd`, checkout `path:`) so it can tell a working workflow from a broken
 * spelling.
 *
 * Neither subsumes the other. Deleting either loses a class of defect that no
 * scan in this repository would then see, and a workflow's outcome is
 * invisible from a checkout — which is the `xom7` defect both exist for.
 *
 * @module test/workflow-paths-resolve.test
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/` (bean `ho66`), as
 * `merge-guard-workflows.test.ts` was: every test in it reads the aggregate
 * repository's own root — `.github/workflows/` — which a standalone
 * cat-harness layer does not have, and `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects
 * every test in that layer.
 *
 * Moved again, from `cat-harness-tools/scripts/tests/` to the checkout's own
 * test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level
 * instance"): what it reads belongs to the whole checkout, which the root
 * instance declares, not to any one layer — so cat-harness-tools stays green
 * standing alone too.
