/**
 * Every source descriptor in the checkout parses — bean `w5bn`.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/schemas/source-descriptor.test
 * @graphNode none — a test
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `lean-mathlib.json`, the second worked descriptor and the one meant to show
 * the abstraction is not IRIS with an interface drawn round it, carried an
 * `_subsetIsSelfContained_note` key. `SourceDescriptorSchema` is `.strict()`,
 * so the file failed its own schema from the day it was written, and nothing
 * said so: no gate read `sources/`.
 *
 * The directories are found through the checkout.s DECLARATIONS, not a literal
 * path, so moving it cannot turn this into a test over nothing.
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/schemas/source-descriptor.test.ts` to the
 * checkout's own test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06
 * "Top-level instance"): every test in it reads the source descriptors the
 * content instances' libraries commit, which only the whole checkout holds.
 * Standing alone, cat-harness has none of it, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer. Paths are
 * composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory it was written in, so nothing it
 * reads changed.
