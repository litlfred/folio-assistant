 * declaration (`memory/`) or the checkout's own submodule layout, which only
 * the checkout holds. Standing alone, cat-harness has none of it, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer. The rest

 * ORIGIN_DIR, the directory they were written in, so nothing they read
 * changed.
