/**
 * `check-import-direction` tests about the WHOLE CHECKOUT, moved here from
 * `cat-harness/scripts/tests/check-import-direction.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`,
 * owner ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level instance"): each reads every instance's
 * declaration and code in the checkout, which only the checkout holds.
 * Standing alone, cat-harness has none of it, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer. The rest
 * of that file's tests stay there; every path here is composed from
 * ORIGIN_DIR, the directory they were written in, so nothing they read
 * changed.
