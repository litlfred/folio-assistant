/**
 * `pair-cover.ts`'s fold, held against the CI workflows (bean `8qyc`).
 *
 * The one `pair-cover` assertion that reads `.github/workflows/`: every pair
 * the table folds, and every coverer it folds into, must be a pair `regen`
 * actually asks, which `regen` derives from the workflows through
 * `loadGates`. It lives here rather than beside the other `pair-cover` tests
 * in `cat-harness/scripts/tests/` because a standalone cat-harness layer has
 * no workflows, and `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that
 * layer. The full repository has them, and this layer is never run alone.
 *
 * Moved again, from `cat-harness-tools/scripts/tests/` to the checkout's own
 * test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level
 * instance"): what it reads belongs to the whole checkout, which the root
 * instance declares, not to any one layer — so cat-harness-tools stays green
 * standing alone too.
