/**
 * Every theme a declaration references is installed (#1168 B8).
 *
 * Theme references became `ThemeRef` objects `{instance?, themeId}` on
 * 2026-09-30 (owner: "migrate to ThemeRef"). The schema checks the shape;
 * this checks the reference RESOLVES. Before it, an unknown theme fell back
 * silently to the default at render time — a declaration that reads as a
 * choice and renders as none.
 *
 * Resolved BY REFERENCE, owner first (`themeByRef`, bean `v8n5`), not against
 * the platform table alone: who-iris's card cites its own `iris-sticky`,
 * which the platform deliberately does not hold, and a platform-only lookup
 * would call that correct reference broken.
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/theme-refs.test.ts` to the
 * checkout's own test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06
 * "Top-level instance"): every test in it resolves every theme reference every
 * instance in the checkout declares, which only the whole checkout holds.
 * Standing alone, cat-harness has none of it, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer. Paths are
 * composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory it was written in, so nothing it
 * reads changed.
