/**
 * `workflow-skill-refs` tests about the WHOLE CHECKOUT, moved here from
 * `cat-harness/scripts/tests/workflow-skill-refs.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`, owner
 * ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level instance"): each resolves every instance's
 * declared diagrams, which only the checkout holds. Standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it, and `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects
 * every test in that layer. The rest of that file's tests stay there. Each path
 * resolves from the instance that declares it, down its `needs` chain
 * (`resolveTranslationPath`), so no root is composed here.
