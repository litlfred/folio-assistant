/**
 * `qa-checker-discovery` tests whose subject is folio-assistant-sci's
 * contribution — the checkers this instance contributes for criteria declared
 * `checker_contributed` — moved here from
 * `cat-harness/scripts/tests/qa-checker-discovery.test.ts` (bean `ho66`). The
 * code under test is cat-harness's, imported DOWN; what it is held against is
 * this instance's, so standing alone cat-harness has nothing for these to
 * read. The rest of that file's tests stay there.
 *
 * Then moved up again, to the aggregate's `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling
 * 2026-10-06 "Top-level instance"): its subject is the WHOLE CHECKOUT — the
 * repository root's dependency tree, which also carries the `dak-*` checkers
 * smart-base contributes — so standing alone folio-assistant-sci has no root
 * for it to load from (`seed:ready --layer folio-assistant-sci --rehearse`,
 * 2026-10-07). Sci's OWN contribution is held in sci, against a folio that
 * depends on it (`folio-assistant-sci/scripts/tests/sci-consumer.ts`).
