/**
 * The Tool audit, run ONCE at module scope.
 *
 * Bean `sff8`. Five tests called `checkTools()` and each paid the full scan, putting
 * two of them among the repository's highest timeout exposure — measured by
 * `check:test-budgets` at **4.45 s and 3.27 s of a 5000 ms default budget** (89 % and
 * 65 %), named before either had gone red.
 *
 * Safe to share because nothing in this file mutates the corpus: all five calls are
 * no-arg, and no test writes a fixture, so five runs could only ever produce the same
 * answer. Module scope also belongs to no test's timeout, which is the remedy `sff8`
 * settled on over a raised budget — a number decays as the corpus grows.
