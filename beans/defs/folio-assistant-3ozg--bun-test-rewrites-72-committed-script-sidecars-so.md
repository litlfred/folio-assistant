Measured 2026-09-27 on pristine main `c6960465301`, and the same on 2026-09-26 at `8fb8a041a8e`.

## What happens

A full `bun test` rewrites all 72 files under `cat-harness/content/pipeline/script-sidecars/`, changing only three fields in each:

    last_run_at     wall-clock time of this run
    last_run_sha    the checked-out HEAD
    engine_version  the local bun (bun-1.3.11 here; the committed copies say bun-1.3.14)

Nothing else in the tree changes. The writer is `saveQaScriptSidecar` (`qa-utils.ts`), and its callers are `script-sweep.ts` and `qa-sweep.ts`.

## Why it matters

`bun run gates` has a tree-mutation detector, which is how bean `ymsu` was made visible. It therefore ends *'every gate passed, and the run is NOT clean — 1 gate(s) changed the tree'* with exit 1, on every branch, pristine main included. A signal that is always red is one people stop reading, and then it cannot report the next real in-run repair, which is the `ymsu` failure class this detector exists for. This is the same class as `ymsu` (in-progress, another session's), but a different writer, and `ymsu` does not mention these files.

## Not yet isolated

Run alone, none of these writes the sidecars: `qa-review`, `profile-conformance-axis`, `corpus-gate`, `check-command-paths`, `lean-ref-coverage`, `qa-checker-discovery`, `pipeline-resolution`, `qa-sweep-merge`, `qa-witness`, `qa-tools`, `usage-paths-self-reference`, `publish-block-qa`. The full suite always does. So it is either an untried file or an interaction between files.

## Done when

- [ ] the test (or interaction) that triggers the write is named
- [ ] it writes into a temp directory, as the profile-conformance tests do, or the three volatile fields stop being committed
- [ ] `bun run gates` on pristine main ends clean, not 'NOT clean'
