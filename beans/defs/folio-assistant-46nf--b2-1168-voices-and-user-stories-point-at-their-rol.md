Part of s4sp (plan B). The 35 role voice sentences become one-rule voice profiles in folio-assistant-core (activeIn.roles to the cat-harness role); the 107 useCases become scenarios/stories.json UserStory nodes pointing at their role. Role.skills typed SkillNameSchema. kg-audit role-declares-voice and role-has-use-cases replaced by role-has-story and story-role-resolves; check:voices resolves activeIn.roles and reports role voice coverage.
