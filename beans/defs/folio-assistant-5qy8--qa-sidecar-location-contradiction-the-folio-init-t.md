Recorded from the qou work-plan analysis, 2026-10-04 (session https://claude.ai/code/session_01NdDGeP1SyShmoUssLuRZ91). Not started: recorded so the gap has an owner. The owner ruled 2026-10-04 for qou: use the cat-harness qa-reports branch. The folio_init template (cat-harness/templates/) still writes a layout that commits sidecars on main. Reconcile the template with skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/qa-reports.md.
