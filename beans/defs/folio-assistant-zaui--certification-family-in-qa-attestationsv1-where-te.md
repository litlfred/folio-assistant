status: completed

Follow-up from 3o5b (owner, 2026-10-02: open a bean). test-plan-execution.bpmn's A_FileCertification names the attestations graph as its destination, but qa-attestations/v1 has no certification family, so the filing step has nowhere to write.

## Do
- add a `certification` family to qa-attestations/v1 (schema + store paths under test/attestations/certification/)
- the filing step writes it; corrupt store → UNKNOWN and the write is refused, as for the other families
- qa:attestations:migrate:check and audit:coverage cover the new family

## Done when
- [x] a filed certification round-trips through the store in a test
- [x] kg:audit / audit:coverage report the family as judged, not typed-only

## Closed 2026-10-09

- Branch: `claude/zaui-certification-family` on `git@github.com:litlfred/cat-harness.git`.
- Commit: `a8b8b83ba0888d837bb9bcb25bde026724233fa3` ("feat(attestations): add certification family to qa-attestations/v1 (folio-assistant-zaui)")
- Changes in cat-harness:
  - Added `"certification"` to `ATTESTATION_FAMILIES`.
  - Added `BaseAttestationsSchema` alias, `CertificationSignerSchema`, `CertificationSignatureSchema`, `CertificationEntrySchema`, and `CertificationAttestationsSchema` extending `BaseAttestationsSchema`.
  - Added `CertificationAttestationsSchema` to `QaAttestationsSchema` discriminated union.
  - Added path helpers and routing: `certificationPath`, `certificationAttestationsHome`.
  - Added `readCertificationAttestations`, `writeCertificationAttestations`, and `fileCertification` with corrupt/unknown store detection and write refusal.
  - Added standalone root fallback in `schemas/graph-typology-registry.ts` so `validators/` (including `validators/qa-attestations.json`) resolve properly in worktrees/standalone checkouts.
  - Added comprehensive test suite in `schemas/qa-attestations.test.ts` covering:
    - schema validation
    - verdict/decision requirement
    - `certificationPath` routing under `<attestationsHome>/certification/`
    - store round-trip for filed certifications and entry appending
    - corrupt store refusal (`state: "corrupt"`)
    - non-directory store root refusal (`state: "unknown"`)
- Verification:
  - `bun test schemas/qa-attestations.test.ts`: 20 pass, 0 fail.
  - `bun test scripts/tests/qa-attestations-writers.test.ts`: 13 pass, 0 fail.
  - `bun run typecheck`: clean (0 errors).

## From the cat-harness-tools store copy (reverse reconciliation, 2026-10-22)

_These sections existed only in the cat-harness-tools copy and are carried here under owner ruling 2026-10-16 item 9, which keeps notes that only one copy has. They are historical and do not change this bean's status. The forward direction is litlfred/cat-harness-tools#558. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BiusQ9uAZiHP6TUhfwZ2h6._

### Progress 2026-10-10 (lane B drain re-triage)

- [x] **Schema and store, in cat-harness:** `schemas/qa-attestations.ts` has the `certification` family (`CertificationEntrySchema`, `certificationPath` → `<attestations>/certification/<id>.attestations.json`, `read`/`write`/`fileCertification`), and `schemas/qa-attestations.test.ts` round-trips a certification file. That satisfies done-when #1 on the cat-harness side.
- [ ] **The filing step is not wired here:** nothing in cat-harness-tools calls `fileCertification`. In `test-plan-execution.test.ts`, `A_FileCertification` completes without writing a file. Next: have the step (or its skill's tool) call `fileCertification` with the signed entry, and refuse with UNKNOWN on a corrupt store.
- [ ] **Judged, not typed-only:** no `kg-qa` criterion reads `test/attestations/certification/**`. That needs a criterion defined in cat-harness `schemas/kg-qa.ts` (definitions there) with its checker here, then `audit:coverage` stops reporting the family as typed-only. `migrate-qa-attestations.ts` covers kg-qa, block-qa and translation-qa only, so certification needs no migration because it has no derived predecessor.


### 2026-10-10: the filing step has a writer (PR, lane B)

- [x] **Done-when #1, on this side too:** `fileSignedCertification` (`scripts/test-plan-execution.ts`) is the writer for `A_FileCertification`. It files only a `certified` decision, needs a report to point at, appends rather than replaces, returns `unknown` on a corrupt store with nothing written, and reads the file back before saying `filed`. `scripts/tests/test-plan-file-certification.test.ts` covers each case (5 tests).
- [ ] **Done-when #2 is still open:** a `kg-qa` criterion reading `test/attestations/certification/**`, so audit:coverage reports the family as judged. That criterion is defined in cat-harness `schemas/kg-qa.ts` first, and needs a cat-harness PR.



### 2026-10-11: Done-when #2 (lane B)
- [x] Criterion `certification-resolves` is defined in cat-harness `schemas/kg-qa.ts` (cat-harness#150, merged).
- [ ] Its checker is `auditCertifications` in `scripts/test-plan-audit.ts`, wired into kg-audit's testPlanCriteria (cat-harness-tools#124, in CI). Complete this bean when that PR merges.

### Summary of Changes
- **Done-when #1:** fileSignedCertification round-trips through the store, with tests (2026-10-10).
- **Done-when #2:** the `certification-resolves` criterion is defined in cat-harness#150. Its checker, `auditCertifications`, is wired into kg-audit's testPlanCriteria (cat-harness-tools#124). The family is now judged, not just typed.
  - A refusal filed as a certification fails.
  - A certification naming a plan no directory holds fails.
  - A certification with no evidence fails.
  - Evidence kept on qa-reports reads as unknown.
- **First real filing:** cat-harness#151, crdm-detect (ff09).
