Split out of `p2en`, whose original question — what schema consolidates math and
health-policy ingestion — is answered. This is the follow-on it uncovered.

## Why

`p2en` landed DAK block kinds, adapter-scoped QA axes, and five DAK checkers,
but those criteria were written from what the corpus happens to contain. WHO
publishes its own authoring standards, and they are the better source: a
criterion derived from `checklist.md` is one a DAK author is already being held
to, rather than one this platform invented.

Repo: <https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/smart-ig-starter-kit>
(cloned at `/home/user/litlfred/smart-ig-starter-kit` during `p2en`).

## Unread

~3,900 of the kit's ~4,300 SOP lines. Only `l2_dak_authoring.md` (421) was read.

Highest-value first, by apparent fit to existing QA machinery:

- `checklist.md` (297) — reads as WHO's own pre-publication gate. Closest thing
  to a ready-made criterion list.
- `qa_check.md` (28) — short; likely names the mechanical checks WHO runs.
- `authoring_conventions.md` (78) — naming/structure rules, the kind a
  mechanical axis can enforce.
- `l3_*.md` (~12 files) — per-artefact-type L3 authoring rules
  (`l3_requirements`, `l3_testing`, `l3_indicators`, `l3_logicalmodels`,
  `l3_valuesets`, `l3_personas`, `l3_forms`, `l3_processes`,
  `l3_structuremaps`, `l3_scenarios`, `l3_examples`, `l3_libraries`).
- `l2_l3_overview.md` (247), `l2_templates.md` (99), `semanticreferences.md`,
  `structure.md`, `l4_compliance.md`.

## Two findings already in hand that belong here

1. **An unenforceable constraint WHO ships.** Every `*Source` in
   `DAKComponentSources.fsh` says in prose "**exactly one of** url | canonical |
   instance must be provided", and there is **not one `Invariant:`/`obeys` in
   any of WHO's 17 logical models** (grepped). A DAK supplying all three, or
   none, validates clean against the FHIR toolchain. This is a QA criterion this
   platform can carry and that toolchain structurally cannot — a strong
   candidate for the first SOP-derived axis.

2. **The official component templates are `.xlsx`, and we have them.**
   `input/images/` ships `DAK_core data dictionary_template_v2.1.xlsx`,
   `DAK_decision-support logic_template_v2.1.xlsx`, `DAK_scheduling logic…`,
   `DAK_indicators and performance metrics…`, `DAK_high-level functional and
   non-functional requirements…` (v2 and v2.1). These define the canonical sheet
   structure for exactly the kinds `WORKBOOK_BACKED_KINDS` exempts from a
   required companion. A workbook reader is now bounded against a published
   template rather than reverse-engineered from one repository — which also
   unblocks the `.xlsx` rendering deferred since §12.18.

## Also still open from `p2en`

- Compare `sgex`'s `bpmn-to-svg.js` (jsdom) against `scripts/bpmn-render.ts`
  (Chromium) on the same 8 WHO processes. Low priority: the Chromium route
  works (8/8, 0 failures), so this is a "is there a lighter dependency" question,
  not a gap.

## Not in scope

Authoring folio content. This repo is the platform; anything WHO-domain that
turns out to be subject matter belongs in a DAK repo as data, per AGENTS.md.


## 2026-10-09: finding 1 checked against the corpus (session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BJNRo4kh8U15HZVFDhYNJL)
Still true on litlfred/smart-base main (c1f7764): `input/fsh/models/DAKComponentSources.fsh` states "exactly one of the following must be provided" in prose with no `Invariant:`. But **no DAK instance in smart-base, smart-trust or smart-immunizations supplies component sources** (no `InstanceOf: DAK`, `dak.json` carries identity only), so a platform checker for it would judge nothing — the `dh4f` shape. The rule's home is the logical model itself: an FSH `Invariant:` (`obeys`) on each `*Source`, which is IG content (the WHO repository, or the fork as a proposal), not platform code. Left for the owner to route; nothing built.

## 2026-10-10 ~15:18 UTC — checklist.md and qa_check.md read and classified (session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BJNRo4kh8U15HZVFDhYNJL)

Kit read at WorldHealthOrganization/smart-ig-starter-kit `286b2a4`.

**qa_check.md (28 lines) names no checks of its own.** It defers to the IG Publisher's `qa.html`. The constraints themselves are "consolidated as profiles" in smart-base (its examples: title+description SHALL; a logical-model element SHALL map to an internal code). These rows belong to the **Publisher's** verdict. A platform copy of them would be the second, weaker verdict that `qa-checkers-dak.ts`'s header already refuses.

**checklist.md: 31 rows (L1 3, L2 9, L3 9, L4 5, Global 5).** Classified by who can answer each row:

| class | rows | can the platform carry it? |
|---|---|---|
| **A. "a page for X exists"** | L1 ×3, L2 ×9, L3 sequence-diagram, Global changes + downloads (15) | Yes, mechanically, BUT see finding 1 |
| **B. defers to qa.html / Publisher** | L3 SPC/executable profile ×2, codings, Global "no errors or unsuppressed warnings", HL7 publishing reqs (5) | No: read the Publisher's verdict, don't re-derive it. A reader of `qa.json` errors/suppressions is the honest version |
| **C. structural, counts over artefacts** | L3 "a logical model per data-dictionary asset", "a StructureMap IPS→dataset per data set", "artefacts per actor"; L4 "an example per non-abstract profile per UN language", "every CQL library has a test library", "every PlanDefinition/Measure has test cases" (6) | Yes: these are FHIR-AST counts (fhir-harness ig-ast) and the strongest candidates for a first SOP-derived axis |
| **D. judgement** | L3 actors "tied to and derived from L2", indicators per DSS/mADX, Global maturity in STU note, versioning (semver inheritance) (5) | Agent/human; semver inheritance is partly mechanical (IG version vs artefact versions) |

**Finding 1, measured. The kit's expected page filenames are NOT what real WHO IGs use**, so a class-A checker keyed on them would report false absences. Scanned on origin/main of the three forks:

- `usecases.xml` is `use_cases.md` (trust) and `scenarios.md` (immz).
- `business_process.xml` is `business-process(es).md` (immz).
- `adapting_guidelines.xml` is `adapting.md` (immz).
- `functional.xml` is `functional-requirements.md` (immz).
- `indicators` exists in immz as two pages (`indicators.md`, `indicators-measures.md`).
- smart-trust has no personas, dictionary, nonfunctional or adapting page under ANY name found by eye.

A class-A axis must key on a DECLARED mapping (menu entry / section title → checklist row), not on filenames. smart-base is the base IG rather than a DAK, so L1/L2 rows are n/a for it.

**Finding 2.** Two rows are unfinished in WHO's own text: the maturity row carries a `TODO: define maturity levels`, and Downloads has Required = `?`. A criterion derived from them would encode an undecided rule.

**Recommended first axis (judgement, not built):** class C, "an example resource per non-abstract profile". It is the most mechanical, it reads the FHIR AST the harness already produces, and nothing else answers it. The UN-language half needs the owner: 6 languages × every profile is a very large corpus obligation.

**Still unread:** authoring_conventions.md, the l3_*.md files and l2_l3_overview.md. Nothing built; bean stays todo.

## 2026-10-10 ~15:21 UTC — authoring_conventions.md measured against the three forks

I measured the kit's naming and location rules over the FSH entity names (Profile/Logical/ValueSet/CodeSystem/Instance/Extension/Resource) on origin/main. SUSHI derives the id from the name unless `Id:` is set; only 7 explicit `Id:` lines exist in total.

| IG | entities | underscore | outside `[A-Za-z0-9.-]{1,64}` | lowercase start | case-collision files |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| smart-base | 220 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| smart-trust | 677 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| smart-immunizations | 731 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

**There are no violations across 1,628 entities.** The id regex is also core FHIR, which the Publisher already enforces. An axis for these rules would therefore be a guard against regression with nothing to find today. It is low priority, and it would overlap the Publisher's verdict for the regex half. Underscore-free names and case-collision filenames are NOT enforced by the Publisher, so those two would be the only part worth carrying.

**The "File Locations" list is not exhaustive in practice.** Real IGs also use `fsh/conceptmaps`, `extensions`, `rulesets`, `instances` and `translations`, none of which the kit lists. A checker that treated the kit list as closed would flag correct content. If anything is built here, it should treat the list as the PREFERRED locations rather than the only allowed ones.

The class-C "example per non-abstract profile" axis from the previous entry remains the recommended first one.

## ~15:25 UTC — sized the recommended class-C axis ("an example per non-abstract profile")

Counted on origin/main: FSH `Profile:` entries with no `^abstract = true`, against FSH `InstanceOf:` targets. JSON examples are not counted, and none exist under `input/examples` in these three.

| IG | non-abstract profiles | with ≥1 `InstanceOf:` example | without |
|---|---|---|---|
| smart-base | 15 | 0 | 15 |
| smart-trust | 0 | 0 | 0 (its content is Logical models + instances) |
| smart-immunizations | 5 | 2 | 3 |

**Do not read smart-base's 0/15 as a defect.** Its `SG*` profiles (SGValueSet, SGLibrary, SGPlanDefinition…) are META-profiles that the artefacts of DEPENDENT IGs conform to. Their natural examples are those IGs' artefacts, reached cross-IG rather than through an `InstanceOf:` in smart-base. A same-IG count is the wrong denominator for a base IG. Any axis built here needs one of two things:
- (a) to be scoped to IGs whose profiles constrain clinical resources, or
- (b) to accept a dependent IG's conforming artefact as the example.

The same caution applies to the cross-IG "conforms to SPC profile" rows, which are class B and the Publisher's call.

smart-immunizations' 3 uncovered profiles are the only real, same-IG findings. That makes the axis's first-run signal small (3 items). It is still the most mechanical candidate, and it needs (a) or (b) decided first. That is an owner decision; nothing built.

## ~15:40 UTC — l3_*.md read for SHALL rules; one cross-artefact rule measured

17 L3 pages, 2,290 lines with l2_l3_overview. Of the SHALL/MUST statements:
- **Most are profile conformance.** For each artefact type they require conformance to CRMIShareable* / CRMIPublishable* (CodeSystem, ConceptMap, PlanDefinition, Questionnaire, Measure, Library), plus CPG/SDC/CQFM profiles. That is class B: the Publisher's validation answers it.
- **Field-population tables** (l3_libraries: ~25 rows of "SHALL be populated with {{ig …}}"). These are also expressible as profile constraints, so class B. Note `useContext` carries an unfinished `????` in WHO's own text.
- **Cross-artefact rules the Publisher does NOT answer** (class C candidates):
  - every CQL library has a Library resource (already measured 279↔279 1:1 in `qa-checkers-dak.ts`'s header);
  - every Decision Table has a Requirements document pointing at it;
  - every input in a decision/scheduling table has a CQL expression;
  - every Measure input is in the measure's `terms` and every term is in the Data Dictionary;
  - Name SHALL equal id (PlanDefinition, Measure, Library);
  - url SHALL be `[base]/Type/[id]`;
  - each definitional artefact has ≥1 example (l3_examples, the same rule as the checklist row sized earlier).

**Measured: name == id on smart-immunizations (origin/main 86898e6).** Raw FSH shows NO `* name =` on 319 of 320 Library/Measure instances, because name is set inside a RuleSet (`* insert LogicLibrary( X )`, `MeasureProportion( [[…]], X, … )`, both doing `* name = "{library}"`). After resolving the RuleSet argument:
- Library: 278/278 have argument == instance id.
- Measure: 41/41 have argument == instance id.
- PlanDefinition: 0 instances in this IG.

**So the rule holds, and the lesson is about WHERE to check.** Any FSH-text checker for a field-level SHALL is blind to RuleSet-set values and would report 319 false "missing name" findings here. Field-level rules must be judged on BUILT resources (SUSHI output, or fhir-harness's ig-ast), never on `.fsh` text. That narrows class C to two kinds of checker:
- presence/pairing counts, which are safe on FSH;
- field rules, which need the AST.
