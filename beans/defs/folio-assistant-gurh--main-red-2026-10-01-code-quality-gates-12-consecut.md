Arc `3fva`, proposal `cat-harness/docs/proposals/qa-reports-branch-and-test-process-2026-10-01.md` §4 item 0.1. Measured 2026-10-01 at about 07:50Z, main `61b1e747`.

The last green Code-quality run was `27067b3fcb0` (#1725, 07:11Z). Since then main has failed 12 times in a row. The handover's "red from #1743" is out of date: #1725 turned it green, and it went red again from `a43d3b4e297` on.

Failing at head:
- Repository gates: the "workflow skill refs" step.
- End-to-end + accessibility: playwright.
- Skill-registration chain: "the registration chain is current, read unmasked".
- `bun test`:
  - `instance-declaration-gate.test.ts:99` (root does not reach agent-skills)
  - `layout-norms.test.ts:130` (smart-base/methodologies contains .../processes)
  - `skill-coverage.test.ts:195` (`l2-dak-authoring` uncovered)
  - `cat-harness.test.ts:1191` (core-/sci-methodologies were renamed)
  - `processes-viz.test.ts:239` (bootstrap-tools/processes appeared in the renders)
  - `ingest-and-l1.test.ts:405` (8 stale sources)
  - stale `gen-lsi-viz` and `qa-results`

Docs site: the "Regenerate skill instruction pages" step fails.

Inference, not yet verified: this is fallout from the placement merges #1758, #1760 and #1761 (session laughing-thompson, epic `iirv`), plus `a43d3b4`. **First check whether that session or #1747 (cmsl step 3) already owns the fix.** Do not duplicate it.

The watchdog (`kgho`) opened #1755 by itself at 07:24Z. That is the first production evidence that it works.

## Done when
- [x] the owner of the fix is identified, or this bean claims it — PR #1769 (bean `6306`), measured 2026-10-01 ~08:50Z; see Triage below
- [x] Code-quality gates and Docs site are green on main — **verified 2026-10-06: last 5 `Code-quality gates` push runs on main green (latest 37421408552 @ 1b17452d); `Docs site` latest settled run 37418387390 @ f4f59102 success.**
- [x] #1755 is closed by the watchdog when it sees green, and NOT by hand — **verified 2026-10-06: #1755 state closed, `closed_by: github-actions[bot]`, 2026-10-01T12:31:33Z — the watchdog, not a hand.**

## Triage, 2026-10-01 ~08:50Z (subagent of session 01LKpuPo, main `cdb0a018`)

**Main is still red at `cdb0a018` (#1721)**: Code-quality run 36834076176 fails Repository gates (step "workflow skill refs"), `bun test`, playwright, and the unmasked registration chain. Docs site run 36834076048 fails at `gen-skill-docs.ts`.

**One root cause explains most of it, and a sibling owns the fix.** Placement PR0 (`ejye`, `9962556c`) removed cat-harness's 20 `scope: "repository"` mirrors of other instances' directories, and made the root `needs` every staged instance. Two later merge resolutions put both back: `aab80f35` (#1744) and `16c02d33` (the #1747 branch's merge of main, carried onto main). So main holds the mirrors again, with `needs: ["folio-assistant-core"]`. Code written after PR0 assumes the PR0 state, and it breaks:
- `check:workflow-refs`: `processes/l2-dak-authoring.bpmn` names `l2-dak-authoring`. PR1 moved that skill to `smart-base/`, which the root no longer reaches. So there are 3 DANGLING refs. `skill-coverage.test` fails for the same reason.
- Docs site: `gen-skill-docs.ts` is keyed by the owners' ids (`core-skills`, `lean-skills`, `data-skills`). The mirror ids came back with the mirrors, so the generator throws on `folio-assistant-{core,sci-lean,sci-data}-skills`.
- `bun test`: placement-PR1 tests ("the checkout knows all of them", role edges), `instance-declaration-gate`, kg-export, materialiseDirectories, and others.

**Owner of the fix: PR #1769** (`claude/fervent-brahmagupta-rbwhzm`, bean `6306`, draft). Its commit `4cded1db` restores PR0's declarations, and `8c84fe63`/`e12b4f10` fix the library-ref red. Its checklist still has "`bun run regen` at a fixed point; `bun run gates`" open. That session says it is consolidating `cmsl`/#1747 too. #1747 (cmsl step 3) separately edits `gen-skill-docs.ts`/`known-skills.ts` and is WIP ("regen pending"). **This bean does not duplicate either.**

**Measured on #1769 merged onto main (local probe branch `gurh-probe-1769`, not pushed):**
- `check:workflow-refs` is green: the l2-dak dangling refs are gone.
- `skill:register:check`: 8 checks are still stale. They are `skills:docs`, `check:glossary`, `docs:auto`, `lsi:skills`, `lsi:viz`, `kg:audit`, `kg:detangle` and `uml:overview`, all derived artefacts that #1769's pending regen step writes.
- `bun test`: 22 fail and 1 error, out of 13603. The failures are almost all stale derived artefacts:
  - LSI viewer, glossary/SKOS, kg-qa sidecars, health report checker hash `55edc157f206`→`d4d64806a93a`, L1 ingest sidecars (`w3c-*`, `hmans-2026-beans-readme`, `mcp-2026-specification-…` stale), and viewer/stale-path pages.
  - Several 5 s timeouts. The machine was under a sibling's concurrent `bun test`, so those need a rerun before anyone reads them as defects.
  - One needs a look after regen: `contentInstanceCode — who-iris` returns `n/a`, not `judged`. The likely cause is that who-iris's code directory is no longer reached once the mirrors go (#1728 flagged that finding as intentionally failing).
- e2e (main): `library-viewer-scope.e2e.ts:91`, "fhir-harness declares 3 library entries on disk and the viewer data holds none". This is a stale viewer projection and is expected to clear with the regen. It was not verified.

**Next, for #1769's owner:** run `bun run skill:register` / `bun run regen` to a fixed point after `4cded1db`, then `bun run gates`. Re-check who-iris `contentInstanceCode` and the fhir-harness library viewer data. Do not close #1755 by hand.


## Still red 2026-10-04, and it is readme:subgraphs — measured from PR #2060

`origin/main` at 679fc7c4c474, check-run 111386484919, annotation verbatim:

    bun run readme:subgraphs:check
      ✗ cat-harness/scripts/README.md is stale
    115 directory README(s); 1 stale. Findings: 111 no title, 2 no description, 89 long description, 0 absent, 2 unmarked, 0 unresolved process.

PR #2060's head (76e1199ff2fa) carries the IDENTICAL annotation — same gate, same one stale README, same finding counts — so a branch off main inherits it and cannot clear it. Everything else on #2060 is green: lint+types, all four bun-test shards, all three e2e shards, skill-registration chain, import hygiene.

**COULD NOT DETERMINE why it is red in CI and green here, and that is the finding, not a gap in the report.** In this container `bun run readme:subgraphs:check` reports `115 directory README(s); 0 stale`, and running the writer produces NO diff against the committed README — so the generator and the committed file agree locally. Measured in support of that: 481 files tracked and 481 on disk directly in `cat-harness/scripts/` against the README's "480 files directly here" (the generator excludes README.md itself), and `tests/` reads 561 tracked / 561 on disk against the README's "568 files" (the generator counts that one recursively). Both self-consistent. So CI's checkout differs from this one in a way that moves the count by one, and I could not identify what from inside the container.

Whoever picks this up: the cheap next step is to make CI print the generator's computed counts next to the committed ones, because the gate currently says WHICH file is stale but not which number moved — and that is why it has survived this long.

## Closed 2026-10-06 on re-measured evidence

Closed by the 3fva QA-readers pass (https://claude.ai/code/session_012qoycyCSGidZqW245vXhze). Every done-when box is ticked; the boxes that waited on a merge or a scheduled run were re-checked against GitHub on 2026-10-06 and carry their evidence inline. Closed on evidence, not authorship (bean-coordination §"Closing a bean whose work has already landed").
