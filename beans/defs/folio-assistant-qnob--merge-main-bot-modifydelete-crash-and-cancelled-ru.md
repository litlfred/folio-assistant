Issue #1854. (1) modify/delete conflicts on generated-pattern paths: take main's side (rm or main's copy), authored stays refused. (2) cancelled/superseded merge-main runs rewrite the PR comment to 'Error (exit )': leave it untouched; comment composition moved to a tested TS function.

## Done when

- [ ] tests fail on origin/main and pass with the fix
- [ ] bun run gates green, PR CI green, PR marked ready
