Found 2026-09-26 while establishing whether `kg:detangle:check` was `hloc`'s
failure or `main`'s. It was neither — it was the container.

## The measurement

`bun run gates` in this checkout rewrote
`cat-harness/test/results/detangle/cat-harness/schemas.detangle.json`:

```
-  "size": 229,       +  "size": 1443,
-  "internal": 125,   +  "internal": 709,
-  "cohesion": 0.82,  +  "cohesion": 0.96,
```

Reverting it made `kg:detangle:check` fail (computed 1443 ≠ committed 229).
Committing it would have pushed a number CI contradicts. **Both options are
wrong**, which is the signal that the disagreement is not in the code.

The control settles it. Same branch, clean `git worktree`, `node_modules`
symlinked, one check at a time:

| tree | stale set |
|---|---|
| pristine `main` | `bootstrap/skills`, `folio-core`, `folio-paper-adapter`, `hypothesis-generation`, `scientific-critical-thinking` |
| this branch, clean worktree | **identical five** |
| this branch, working checkout | `cat-harness/schemas` — and **none of the five** |

`cat-harness/schemas` appears in NEITHER clean tree. The cause is an untracked,
gitignored **`_kg/` (4.8 MB)** at the repository root of this container, which
the detangler walks.

## Why it is worth a bean rather than a shrug

**It inverts the usual control.** The standard question is "is this failure
mine or main's", answered by comparing against the base branch. Here the answer
was "neither", and the comparison actively MISLEADS: the working checkout and
pristine main produced **disjoint** stale sets, so a count comparison says
"1 vs 5, different, therefore mine" and a naive set comparison says "no overlap,
therefore mine". Both conclude wrongly. Only a clean worktree of the SAME
branch separates container state from code.

**It is silent and it is sticky.** Nothing warns that `_kg/` is there; it is
gitignored, so `git status` is clean; and the inflated number is plausible
rather than absurd. Every local `bun run gates` in this container has been
rewriting that sidecar, and the only reason it surfaced is that a stop-hook
flagged the dirty file.

**A sibling already paid for the audit:coverage half.** The standing warning is
*"NEVER run audit:coverage in this container, INCLUDING to read its output —
untracked root `_kg/`/`schemas/` pollute it"*. This extends the same cause to
`kg:detangle`, which that warning does not name, and the extension is what cost
the time.

## Done when

[ ] It is established WHERE `_kg/` comes from — which script writes it, and
    whether it is a legitimate cache or a stray output. Deleting it without
    knowing that just moves the surprise.
[ ] The detanglers (and whatever else walks the repo root) either skip
    gitignored directories or state why they must not. `gitCorpus` already
    exists for exactly this and is used by four scanners; this one is not among
    them.
[ ] Verified by BREAKING it — recreate `_kg/`, confirm the count inflates, then
    confirm the fixed scanner ignores it. A number that happens to be right on
    a clean machine is not a fix.
[ ] The standing audit:coverage warning is widened, or replaced by the scanner
    fix that makes it unnecessary.

## Not claimed

That `_kg/` should be deleted — `deletion-requires-confirmation` applies, and
nobody has established what it is. Reported, not removed.


## ESCALATION 2026-09-26: the polluted value has reached `main`, and it cost me a wrong commit

This bean was filed as "a local measurement is wrong in this container". Both
halves of that are now too weak.

### It is on the default branch

    git show origin/main:.../cat-harness/schemas.detangle.json  →  "size": 1443

Earlier the same day the committed value was **229** and only this container's
working tree produced 1443. Within roughly ninety minutes `main` carried 1443.
Nobody decided that: a session ran the writer in a polluted checkout and
committed what it produced, which is exactly what this bean predicted and did
not say loudly enough. The clean-worktree value is **229**.

### I then committed a polluted value MYSELF, with a confident wrong argument

Working `m5gx`, two detangle sidecars came back dirty and I reasoned:

> both move by exactly +1 — `processes` outbound 499→500, `folio-core` inbound
> 521→522. `Task_Gates` carries `<skill ref="platform-gates"/>`, which is one
> new edge from processes to skills/folio-core. That is NOT the biz4
> pollution, whose signature is entirely different (schemas 229→1443).

Every sentence there is checkable and the conclusion was still wrong. The
clean worktree computes `folio-core` inbound **521** — unchanged from `main`.
The `+1` was pollution, and the "signature" I used to rule pollution out was a
rationalisation that happened to fit.

**The lesson is not "check the signature more carefully."** A plausible delta
is exactly what pollution looks like when it is small. The only thing that
distinguishes them is a CLEAN WORKTREE, and I had already written that in this
bean before ignoring it because the number looked explainable.

### It cannot be verified in this container at all

With the clean values copied in, `kg:detangle:check` STILL fails here: the
check recomputes, and the recomputation is polluted. So this gate is
structurally unverifiable in any checkout with a stray `_kg/`, in both
directions — it fails on correct data and passes on wrong data.

## Done when — REVISED

[ ] `main`'s `cat-harness/schemas.detangle.json` is corrected from 1443 to the
    clean-worktree value, and whoever committed it is told why, so the same
    checkout does not re-commit it.
[ ] Establish WHAT WRITES `_kg/`. Still unknown, still not deleted —
    `deletion-requires-confirmation`.
[ ] The detanglers skip gitignored directories, or state why they must not.
    `gitCorpus` exists for this and four scanners already use it.
[ ] Verified by BREAKING it: recreate `_kg/`, confirm the count inflates, then
    confirm the fixed scanner ignores it.
[ ] A guard that a committed measurement matches a CLEAN recomputation, because
    the failure mode here is a wrong number that looks right — and this bean
    now has two recorded instances of a reader accepting one, including its own
    author.


## RESOLVED 2026-09-26 — and this bean's own framing was too narrow

The inflation is fixed on `main`, by `a0f7719032e` — *"xd1g: kg-detangle asks git
for its corpus"*. Before it the detangler **walked the filesystem** and counted
untracked and ignored content; after it, it asks git, so only the tracked corpus
counts. `cat-harness/schemas.detangle.json` now reads **231**.

**This bean blamed `_kg/`. The real fault was ignore-BLINDNESS, of which `_kg/`
is one member.** That distinction is not pedantry — it is exactly what misled
the session working `ymsu`, whose correction on `main` is worth quoting because
the reasoning is reusable:

> I tested whether an untracked `_kg/` explained the inflation: moved it aside,
> still got 1443, concluded ignore-blindness was not the cause. The test was too
> NARROW rather than wrong — removing one ignored directory does not remove the
> others an ignore-blind walk also sees, so the number barely moved and I read
> "barely moved" as "not the cause". **A negative result from removing ONE member
> of a set says nothing about the set.**

They also retracted the inversion this bean recorded: 229 was right and 1443 was
theirs, not `main`'s. So the escalation above — *"the polluted value has reached
`main`"* — was **true when written and is no longer true**, and the value was put
there by a session that has since corrected it in public.

## Verified by breaking it, obtained naturally

The bean asked for the pollution to be recreated and the fixed scanner shown to
ignore it. No recreation was needed: **`_kg/` is still present in this container,
4.8 MB, and `kg:detangle:check` now exits 0 with `size: 231`.** The same checkout
computed 1443 earlier today. Three controls agree:

| tree | result |
|---|---|
| clean worktree of current `main` | exit 0, 29 measurements current |
| this container, `_kg/` PRESENT | exit 0, `size: 231` |
| this container, earlier today | `size: 1443` |

## Done when — settled

[x] `main`'s value corrected — **231**, by the session that introduced 1443.
[x] The detanglers skip ignored content — via `gitCorpus`, which `a0f7719032e`
    also relocated to `schemas/` so a skill does not import from a script.
[x] Verified by BREAKING it — the contamination is still on disk and no longer
    reaches the measurement.
[ ] **WHAT WRITES `_kg/` is still unknown**, and it is still not deleted
    (`deletion-requires-confirmation`). It is now HARMLESS to this gate rather
    than answered, and that distinction is the point: the question is real, it
    is just no longer blocking.
[ ] **`audit-coverage.ts` still walks** — `readdirSync` at line 270, no
    `gitCorpus`. The standing warning *"never run audit:coverage in this
    container"* is STILL LIVE. That belongs to **`xd1g`**, which owns the
    scanner sweep and is open and unclaimed; six scanners have adopted
    `gitCorpus` so far.

Closed as the detangle question it was filed for. The two unticked items are
recorded rather than carried: one is a question nobody has answered, the other
is `xd1g`'s.

## Nearly lost

This bean existed only on PR #1401's branch, which was closed unmerged as a
duplicate of `om30`; resetting the branch afterwards discarded it. Recovered
from `d25494497bb` by hand. `ahab`, `3x2o` and `872t` survived because they rode
merged PRs, and `m5gx` survived because `beans:claim` pushes the bean to the
default branch — **claiming is what made it durable**, which is a reason to
claim beyond coordination.
