Owner, 2026-09-30: Enum. KgRef.kind is a free string (todo.ts, carried-note.ts), so 'skil' parses. Build the enum from the graph-kind registry.

## Done when
- [ ] KgRefSchema.kind is an enum; every committed KgRef parses



## Done
Owner chose Enum anyway (2026-09-30) over the open-string alternative. KG_NODE_KINDS in carried-note.ts (+agent for memory scoping); kg-node-kinds.test holds it in step with kg-export's minted kinds.
