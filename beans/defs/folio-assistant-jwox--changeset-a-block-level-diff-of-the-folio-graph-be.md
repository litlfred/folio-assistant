**What.** A `ChangeSet` node computed between two refs (`origin/main` and the
branch that STAGING rendered). For each block it records one of: added,
removed, modified (prose / structure / metadata), moved (new parent or order),
or renamed (via `renamedFrom`, child 01). It is keyed on folio/ graph ids,
**not** on file paths.

**Why not reuse `diff`.** The `diff` skill is `git diff origin/main..HEAD` over
the content `.ts` files. It sees files. A move across chapters, or two blocks
in one file, reads as noise at that level.

**Existing pieces to reuse, not rebuild:**
- `scripts/render-changed-blocks.ts` already computes "blocks this branch
  touched", but only for the PDF path.
- `staging-banner.ts` already writes `staging.json` with a compare-with-main
  deep link (g4dv).

**Publishing.** The ChangeSet ships as part of the staging deployment's
metadata graph. This is 6pfo's subject ("staging metadata as a KG graph"), so
it lands there, not in a second file. It is exposed as a Tool node
(`folio_changeset`) so an agent gets the same answer the page shows.

## Done when
- [x] a `ChangeSet` schema in folio-assistant-core/schemas, with the five change kinds. Modelled as added / removed / changed, where changed carries the aspects renamed, prose, manifest and moved (see round 1)
- [x] the computation is a Tool node bound to a BPMN task, tested on a fixture with each kind. `folio-changeset` in `folio-assistant-core/tools/`, reached by p0za's discovery. It satisfies `diff` and `staging-review`, whose skills are referenced by the `content-change-review` and `feature-staging` BPMN tasks. The computation's fixture tests landed in #981
- [ ] feature-staging.yml emits it into the staging metadata (coordinated with 6pfo). **Re-homed to ojcx**: this repo holds no folio, so an emission step here would compute over nothing. The emission belongs in the reusable staging workflow that ojcx makes for folio repos
- [x] `diff` and `staging-review` read it instead of re-deriving from git (round 2)


Claimed 2026-09-22 by branch claude/kind-albattani-0qe9gj (session_017nyJj3PsjvszpF3DyGeBgE), stacked after 5xzc (#976).

## Round 1: 2026-09-22

`folio-assistant-core/schemas/changeset.ts`, with the schema, the computation and a CLI; 10 git-fixture tests.

**Shape changed from the bean's wording.** The bean listed five kinds as alternatives: added, removed, modified, moved, renamed. They are not alternatives, because one edit can move, reword and rename a block at once. So a block is added, removed or **changed**, and a changed block lists every aspect that applies.

**Two decisions the tests pin:**
- **Moved is relative.** Only blocks off the longest common subsequence of their section count as moved, so inserting a block at the top of a section moves nothing.
- **A declared rename is not also a manifest edit.** The label and renamedFrom fields are blanked before hashing.

**Safety.** The base ref is read as text: git archive, then `walkBlocks` with verify:false. Old code is never executed.

**Placement.** The module lives in core. Core may import the harness, and the harness may not import core (`check:partition`). So the Tool node that wraps it must live in core too, or read its JSON output.

**Still open:** the remaining three Done-when boxes.

## Round 2: 2026-09-22

- **`diff` skill.** "Finding changed blocks" now runs the ChangeSet CLI. The old recipe grepped changed `.ts` files, so it **missed every prose-only edit** (a `.md` change with no `.ts` change, the commonest edit in a document folio), and it saw moves and renames only as noise. Its change categories are now the ChangeSet's own aspects, so the report and the review page cannot disagree.
- **`staging-review` skill.** It gains a folio-content row in "what changed → which page", and step 1 of content-authoring integration computes the ChangeSet rather than a file list. It ranks "where to start" by changed blocks per section.
- **The Tool is blocked on p0za (new)**, a measured composition gap. Eight of the nine consumers of the tools list read the harness-only barrel. smart-base's Tools are already declared and never served.
- **Staging emission is re-homed to ojcx.** This repo has no folio for it to compute over.

## Round 3 (2026-09-22)

Once p0za's auto-discovery landed, the `folio-changeset` Tool was declared in `folio-assistant-core/tools/index.ts`, and core declares its `tools/` directory. The one box left is staging emission, which is re-homed to ojcx.
