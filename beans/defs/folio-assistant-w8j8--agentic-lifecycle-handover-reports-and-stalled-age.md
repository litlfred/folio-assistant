Owner, 2026-10-02, verbatim: "prepare for you and your current siblings to stall out in the next 5-30 minutes … each agent should prepare a templated 'handover report' … an 'incoming stalled agent triage' process … consolidate the various workstreams into 2-4 themes … coordinate with relevant agents (e.g. the Merge Manager) … update processes, skills, tools etc. include as part of SDLC under agentic coding (and managing agentic coding lifecycles as they work on epics)".

PR #1912, branch claude/blissful-ride-c2f26u-handover.

## Done when
- [x] skill `handover-report` (template, committed as a bean note)
- [x] skill `stalled-agent-triage`
- [x] process `processes/sdlc/stalled-agent-triage.bpmn`, indexed in the workflow list
- [ ] regenerated artefacts current (render:bpmn, skill:register, regen); gates green
- [ ] tool `handover:collect --since <time> | --session <url>`: lists handover notes and the footprint (open PRs by Claude-Session, branches, in-progress beans, workflow instances) as JSON, so triage step 1 is one command
- [ ] `session-state-machine` / `bean-lifecycle` link: an agent's arc ends in a handover note (an epic-level lifecycle step), not only in a merge
- [ ] first real use: triage of the 2026-10-02 lead session and its subagents
