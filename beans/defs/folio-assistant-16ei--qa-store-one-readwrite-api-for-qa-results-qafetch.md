Arc `3fva`, proposal §2.2–2.4 and §4 Phase 2. Blocked on the SPIKE bean. Serial, one agent: everything else depends on this.

- `qa-store` module:
  - `readQa(ref, path)` returns hit / miss / corrupt / unknown, and a miss is never read as clean;
  - `publishQa(ref)` follows the lake-cache write path, with fetch → rebuild-on-tip → push, 3 attempts and `backoff-sleep.ts`, and never `-f`.
- `bun run qa:fetch [--ref main|<sha>|pr/<n>]` and `bun run qa:publish`.
- `storage: {branch, keyedBy}` on `ContentDirectory` (`schemas/cat-harness.ts`). `test/results/` goes into `.gitignore` only when it is set. `audit:coverage` and `check:harness-dirs` both honour it.
- CI publishes `main/<sha>` on push and `pr/<n>/<sha>` on PR (D3). A `check-workflows` finding `qa-reports-unretried`.
- A prune workflow on `schedule`. The lake-cache prune never ran, because its trigger cannot fire.

## Done when
- [x] the module has 4-state tests on real git repositories, not mocks (as `520m` did) — `scripts/tests/qa-store.test.ts`
- [ ] main and PR runs publish, and a sibling's entry survives concurrent writes — the concurrent-writer survival is tested locally against a real bare remote (a forced race, and two CLI processes started together); CI has not published yet, because nothing is pushed
- [ ] the prune runs on schedule at least once


## Progress 2026-10-01 (branch `worktree-agent-ab1c210ad9aa5cbbf`, NOT pushed)

Held by session https://claude.ai/code/session_01LKpuPotV3Ve5Za75DQ3AQR (sub-agent of `claude/quirky-davinci-ixuymr`). Announced here rather than through `beans:claim`, because this session pushes nothing.

- [x] `cat-harness/scripts/qa-store.ts`: `resolveQaLocation`, `readQa` / `readQaTree` / `readQaManifest` (hit / miss / corrupt / unknown; exit 0 / 1 / 3 / 4, usage 2), `fetchQa` (one batch, never deletes, reports `extra`), `publishQa`, `pruneQa`, and `githubPublishDecision` (fork skip).
- [x] `qa:fetch`, `qa:publish`, `qa:prune` in package.json.
- [x] `storage: {branch, keyedBy: "commit"}` on `ContentDirectory`, set on no declaration. Honoured by `check:declared-dirs`, `harness:dirs` (neither creates the directory nor lists it as missing) and `audit:coverage` (new state `stored`). Nothing is `.gitignore`d yet.
- [x] CI: a `qa-publish` job in `code-quality-gates.yml` (`needs: gates`, `always()`, `contents: write`), `Task_QaPublish` in the BPMN, `gates.ts` skips publisher jobs, and `check:workflows` has the new finding `qa-reports-unretried`.
- [x] `.github/workflows/qa-reports-prune.yml`: a schedule, plus a dispatch that is a dry run by default. It was not run.
- [x] Tests on real temporary repositories (`qa-store.test.ts`, `directory-storage.test.ts`, `qa-reports-ci.test.ts`).
- [ ] the first CI publish (this needs the branch pushed and merged)
- [ ] the first scheduled prune

Measured read-only against the real remote: `qa:fetch` on `qa-reports` returns a MISS (exit 1), because the branch does not exist yet. A read of spike entry `qa-reports-spike:main/cdb0a018…` returns CORRUPT (exit 3) in 2.4 s, because spike manifests have no `payloadTree`.


## Production evidence 2026-10-01 11:3xZ (parent session)
Merged into `claude/quirky-davinci-ixuymr` (`1d49d343`, `475e5ca7`). The agent's own full-gate run was cut off by a container restart, so the parent verified instead: tsc 0, eslint 0, qa-store/storage/CI tests 48/48, `check:workflows` 0, `audit:coverage:check` 0. CI `bun test` on `475e5ca7`: 21 failing tests, all on main's list too; none new.

**First real publish:** the `qa-publish` job on PR #1764 created `qa-reports` at `6cb19a24` (author `folio-qa-bot`): `index.json` plus `pr/1764/475e5ca7…/`, 1150 files, 8,231,995 bytes. It ran after red gates, as designed (`always()`).
