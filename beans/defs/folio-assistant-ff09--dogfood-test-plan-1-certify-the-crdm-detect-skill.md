Arc `3fva`, proposal §3.3 and §4 item 5.6. Blocked on the TEST PROCESS bean.

The skill it certifies is the one #203 asked for (CRDM: recognise a feature
request and run a requirements process). #203 stays open until the owner
authorises closing it; this bean is where the work plan reaches it.

`test/results/crdm-detect-eval.test-run.json` already holds 27 cases with precision and recall, plus a second-annotator corpus in `scripts/eval/`. Turn it into `test-plan/v1`, execute it through `test-plan-execution.bpmn`, and take a certification decision. The second plan is an MCP tool (`workflow_complete` refuses a step that is not enabled). The third is a FHIR IG, which needs CWA 16408 uploaded (`y4uj`).

## Done when
- [ ] a signed certification exists for crdm-detect at a stated version, stored per D5
- [ ] the report renders, and its badge links to the run


## Owner ruling 2026-10-01
A plan needs at least one `req:` requirement. **Write a crdm-detect requirement first** (what precision/recall it must reach, and on which corpus), then build the plan against it.

## Owner ruling (2026-10-11 ~06:55 UTC, drain ml9h)

**Certified.** Asked in session_01JkK6uP3iU2etyMbrw7v3cu with lane B's evidence (run r-3554a15543fc-00051fde91fd: 27/27 executed, 25 pass, 2 warn, 0 fail; P=R=F1=0.9545; untainted checker agreed on 6 sampled). The owner's pick stands as the human signature; lane B files it (fileSignedCertification, human route).

## Summary of Changes

Built to the owner's option 4 (no threshold).
- **Requirement and plan:** `req:crdm-detect-evaluation`, the plan `test/plans/crdm-detect-evaluation.test-plan.json` and the `test-plans` directory (cat-harness#145). The system under test is the `crdm-detect-signals` actor (cat-harness#146).
- **Execution:** run through test-plan-execution.bpmn by scripts/run-crdm-detect-plan.ts (cat-harness-tools#122).
  - 27 cases: 25 pass, 2 warn, 0 fail.
  - P = R = F1 = 0.9545, recorded and not graded.
  - The untainted checker agrees on its sample.
  - All four test-plan audit criteria pass.
- **Done-when 1:** the signed certification is filed with fileSignedCertification (cat-harness#151). Signer: the owner, by the human route. The decision was relayed from lane A's session, and the record says so.
- **Done-when 2:** the report renders (test-report.md) and its badge links to the run (scripts/render-test-report.ts, #122).
- **Not done:** the signed report is not stored on qa-reports. cat-harness has no qa-reports branch, and bean 3hk4 refuses a one-run entry. So Task_StoreSigned stays open in beans/workflows/, and certification-resolves (zaui) reads this certification as unknown until a full cat-harness qa publish exists.

_2026-10-16T06:30:00Z_ — Completed here to match the cat-harness and cat-harness-tools stores (Owner ruling 2026-10-16, item 6); the Summary of Changes above is copied from them. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01Pc8vSeXCwp5Ckvmz56cMDs.

## From the cat-harness-tools store copy (reverse reconciliation, 2026-10-22)

_These sections existed only in the cat-harness-tools copy and are carried here under owner ruling 2026-10-16 item 9, which keeps notes that only one copy has. They are historical and do not change this bean's status. The forward direction is litlfred/cat-harness-tools#558. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BiusQ9uAZiHP6TUhfwZ2h6._

### Re-triage 2026-10-10 (lane B drain)

- **Blocked by `zaui`:** nothing calls `fileCertification` yet, so "a signed certification exists … stored per D5" has nowhere to land.
- **Measured baseline** (`crdm-detect-eval.test-run.json`, 27 cases from the issue corpus): TP 21, FP 1, TN 4, FN 1, so **precision 0.9545, recall 0.9545, F1 0.9545**.

### Owner decision

The owner ruled 2026-10-01 that a requirement comes first. What must crdm-detect reach, on the 27-case issue corpus plus the second-annotator set in `scripts/eval/`?

1. **(Recommended)** **Precision ≥ 0.90 and recall ≥ 0.90.** The current run passes with room for one more error on each side.
2. **Precision ≥ 0.95 and recall ≥ 0.95.** The current run passes exactly; one more error fails it.
3. **Precision ≥ 0.95 and recall ≥ 0.85.** This favours precision, because a false CRDM flag spends a person's time.
4. **No threshold:** the certification records the numbers and certifies only that the plan was executed.

**Default if no answer:** option 1, written as the `req:` requirement once zaui unblocks the filing.

### Owner ruling 2026-10-11 (relayed by lane A, answered in their session)

**Option 4, no threshold:** the certification records the numbers and certifies only that the test plan was executed.

### Progress 2026-10-11 (lane B), owner option 4 (no threshold)
- [x] `req:crdm-detect-evaluation`, the plan `test/plans/crdm-detect-evaluation.test-plan.json` and the `test-plans` directory declaration (cat-harness#145). The system under test is the `crdm-detect-signals` actor (cat-harness#146).
- [x] Executed through test-plan-execution.bpmn (cat-harness-tools#122).
  - Run r-3554a15543fc-54762ece6646: 25 pass, 2 warn, 0 fail; P = R = F1 = 0.9545, recorded; the checker agrees on 6 of 27.
  - All four test-plan audit criteria pass.
  - The report renders as test-report.md, with a badge that links to the run.
- [ ] **A_RecordCertification is a user task.** I sent it to the owner through lane A as a numbered choice (default 3: publish first, then ask). The instance waits in beans/workflows/.
- [ ] Signing (human route) and filing with fileSignedCertification; publishing the run directory to qa-reports.
