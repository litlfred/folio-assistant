title: 'CREDENTIALS (iii): credentials/ declaration (needs, profile, registry) for bootstrap-tools and folio-assistant'

From the proposal cat-harness/docs/proposals/credentials-needs-and-supply.md §2.3–2.4 (D3=A). Register three graph kinds: credential-needs (context), credential-profile (context), credential-registry (state). Write the needs for every secret in §1.1. The profile is personal-github with the App (D1=A). Declare sign-artefact as a need with no supply yet (D4=A). bootstrap-tools carries its own file, tagged with $schema and with no import (falsifier 4). Contains no values. Not built yet.

## Done when
- [ ] both instances declare credentials/ and the kinds validate
- [ ] every secrets.* reference in both repositories maps to a declared need

## OWNER, 2026-10-20 (owner, structured question, 2026-10-20 ~18:00Z; session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BiusQ9uAZiHP6TUhfwZ2h6)

Asked where the index's own workflows' credential needs live (data file in .github / index declares an instance / move workflows to instances): **"Defer"**. Stays todo; not to be built until re-asked.

_2026-10-24T08:25:00Z_ — Owner re-asked (structured question Q4, 08:19Z, options: data file in .github / index declares an instance / move workflows to instances / defer): **"D": keep deferred**. Stays todo, not to be built and not in any drain queue until the owner re-opens it. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01FABZmtqnNeBaTcHsXrtyK7.
