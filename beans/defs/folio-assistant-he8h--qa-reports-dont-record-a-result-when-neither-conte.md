## Why

The owner saw the same mechanical QA results repeated on the `cat/cat-harness/qa-reports`
branch (2026-10-05). Measured that day: `main/` holds 140 per-commit snapshots, and its
`cat-harness/test/results/translation-qa` subtree has only **2 distinct trees** across
them (89 + 51 identical copies). 142 `pr/<n>` refs add more. Prune keeps everything on
main for 90 days, so nothing has gone yet.

## Owner's rule (2026-10-05)

> if content didnt change, and result didnt change, dont need to record.

So a publish must not write a new entry for a subject whose content hashes
(`field_hash` / `source_hashes`) AND result are both unchanged from the newest
recorded entry. A reader at a later sha must still resolve the result — e.g. by
falling back to the newest earlier entry (like `MOVED_QA_SUBJECTS`/`movedFrom` falls
back on a miss), not by reporting `miss`/unknown.

## Done when

- [x] `qa-store` publish skips unchanged subjects (or entire unchanged snapshots).
- [x] `readBaseline`/`readQa` resolve a skipped sha to the last recorded result; a
      test shows a skipped commit is not read as "never audited".
- [x] Measured again on qa-reports after a few pushes: no identical repeats added.

## Closed 2026-10-09

- **Branch**: `claude/he8h-qa-reports-skip-unchanged`
- **Commit**: `231aa7ef13d00328d526acaee66ac2589ef9c3dd`
- **Implementation**:
  - In `scripts/qa-store.ts`, updated `publishQa`: when candidate trees match the latest recorded snapshot for the branch (or PR), publish skips writing duplicate payload trees (`state: "skipped"`, exit 0, outputs `SKIPPED`). Supports `--force` flag.
  - In `readQa`, `readQaManifest`, `readQaTree`, `readBaseline`, added fallback resolution for skipped commits: when reading a commit on a branch whose QA was skipped due to unchanged content/results, falls back to the preceding recorded snapshot rather than returning `miss`/`unknown`.
- **Verification**:
  - `bun test scripts/tests/qa-store.test.ts`: 31 tests passed across suite, verifying skipped commits resolve to fallback hit, changed results publish new entries, and force flag bypasses skip.
  - `bun run typecheck`: clean pass (0 errors).
