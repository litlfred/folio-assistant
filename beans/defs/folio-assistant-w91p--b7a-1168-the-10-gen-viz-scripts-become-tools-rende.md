Owner 2026-09-24: 'A: viz scripts become Tools'. 36 coverage.visualiser entries (23 single, 13 lists); none of the 10 gen-*-viz scripts is a declared Tool (tools/index.ts has 61). Each becomes a Tool with renders: <graph kind> and maintains: its pages; per-instance pages computed from Tool + directory id; the 13 lists need a rule. Derive each directory's viewers; remove coverage.visualiser.



## Claim released 2026-09-29

Released `in-progress` → `todo` on the owner's instruction (review session https://claude.ai/code/session_014Qj8wncQhqV52QGN1yZDnj). No git change to this bean since before 2026-09-26, no holder recorded, and the owner judged it NOT part of the live bootstrap-separation (repo split) work. The session that held it stopped on the 2026-09-25 weekly usage limit. Nothing in the body was changed: re-claim with `bun run beans:claim <id>`.
