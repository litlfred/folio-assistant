Story S5 (txue), with/after 70lx. Rows: cat-harness/docs/proposals/placement-audit-2026-10-01.json (PR #1778) — pr '(#223 code partition; S5)', instance=cat-harness, target folio-assistant-sci: MOVE 49, AMBIGUOUS 10 (owner Q4: SPLIT — generic pipeline -> cat-harness-tools, Lean/LaTeX checkers -> sci code plugged into it). Plus smart-base 3, fhir-harness 2, core 1. One agent at a time.
## Done when
- [ ] rows moved/split; typecheck program conserved; gates green; merged

## State 2026-10-09
Re-derived from `placement-audit-2026-10-01.json` against the post-split mount: of the **73** rows tagged `unplanned (#223 code partition; S5)`, **67** are still at their original path. Blocker `70lx` is completed, so this is unblocked; it is now cross-repository work (litlfred/cat-harness[-tools] → litlfred/folio-assistant-sci).
