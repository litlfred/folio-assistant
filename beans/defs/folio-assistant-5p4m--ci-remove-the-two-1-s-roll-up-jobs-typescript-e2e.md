Issue #2456. Owner approved 2026-10-07 ~19:40Z ("1y, 2y, 3y, 4y"). Measurements in the issue body.

_2026-10-07T19:39:38Z_ — Claimed by claude/ci-runner-budget (session https://claude.ai/code/session_013WbQekVypi9A6YQbLDXMmJ).

## Done on claude/ci-runner-budget (PR #2457), 2026-10-07

- Removed jobs `typescript` and `e2e` (commit 35a8229de93). Nothing outside the workflow read the names except the ui-accessibility skill sentence (updated) and workflow-yaml.test.ts (now asserts the two real jobs, both shard matrices, and that the roll-ups stay gone). BPMN Task_TypeScript / Task_E2E documentation updated.
- **Owner action, branch protection (403 for agents):** remove `TypeScript — tests, lint, types (hard)` and `End-to-end + accessibility (hard)`; add `TypeScript — lint and types (hard)`, `TypeScript — bun test, shard 1/4`..`4/4`, `End-to-end + accessibility, shard 1/3`..`3/3`. Required checks confirmed active in CI check runs.

## Landed evidence (PR #2457)
- Completed and merged to main in PR #2457 (commit `35a8229de93a` / `ea77c253665`).
- Removed `typescript` and `e2e` roll-up jobs. Shard checks active. Verified on main.
