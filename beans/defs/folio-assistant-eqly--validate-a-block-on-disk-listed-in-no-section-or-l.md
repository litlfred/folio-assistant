Recorded from the qou orphaned-content census, 2026-10-04 (ORPH report; session https://claude.ai/code/session_01NdDGeP1SyShmoUssLuRZ91, issue #2106). qou: 3 of 3,676 block manifests are in no chapter section and render nowhere, each with .md, .ts and a QA sidecar (e.g. prop:atomic-q-reeb-universal-rho). cat-harness validate.ts has no rule for 'on disk, in no section' or 'in a section, not on disk'. Proposed: one rule, both directions, reported per block.
