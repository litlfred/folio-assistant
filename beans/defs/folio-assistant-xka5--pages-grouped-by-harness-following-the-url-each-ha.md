Owner, 2026-10-05, asked how to group the 79 top-level pages: 'dont want additional categorization that will drift, needs maintain. do it by harnesses to follow urls <base>cat-harness/docs/<harness>. each harness is responsible for managing its own sub doc graphs (if any) which then make up the hierarchy'. Also: '(and alphabetization//locale dependent)' — order within a level alphabetical by the page language's collation (Intl.Collator), not by hand-kept nav_order.

Measured today: just-the-docs 0.12, order by nav_order then title; 79 top-level entries, 42 with no nav_order (35 of them proposals/*.md), many ties.

## Done when
- [ ] the Pages list's top level is the harnesses, derived from the URL, never a hand-kept list
- [x] below a harness, its own declared sub-doc graphs make the hierarchy (`doc-group` in `cat-harness/docs/docs.json` + `_config.yml` `defaults`, PR #2215)
- [ ] order within a level is alphabetical in the reader's locale (`sortNavByLocale` was retired 2026-10-15 when the sidebar moved to the server-built rail `jekyll-pages-nav.ts`, where `byNavOrder` sorts by `nav_order` then case-insensitive title without reader locale)
- [x] no category exists that someone has to maintain (a page's group is its folder via `_config.yml` `defaults`)
