Issue #2456. Owner approved 2026-10-07 ~19:40Z ("1y, 2y, 3y, 4y"). Measurements in the issue body.

_2026-10-07T19:39:38Z_ — Claimed by claude/ci-runner-budget (session https://claude.ai/code/session_013WbQekVypi9A6YQbLDXMmJ).

## Done on claude/ci-runner-budget (PR #2457), 2026-10-07 (commit 86ad61f3976)

- (a) concurrency: push events share one group per ref and cancel-in-progress. The comment cites #2456 and the ruling ("1y, 2y, 3y, 4y"). workflow_dispatch (merge-main judging a PR branch) stays per-sha and uncancelled.
- (b) `verdict-reuse` job (push only) + `cat-harness/scripts/verdict-reuse.sh`. It reuses only when ALL hold: a two-parent merge; a run on the second parent concluded success; that run's recorded tested tree (`tested-tree:` in the producer's check-run summary, or the head's tree for dispatch) equals HEAD^{tree}; and all 8 skippable jobs succeeded in it. Then the 4 test shards, the 3 e2e shards and the standalone ratchet are skipped; the gates roll-up accepts the skipped ratchet only then; the summary names the reused run. Anything undetermined runs everything. Kept on main: lint/types, hygiene, gates-kg/docs/unrun, skill chain (some judge against main or read qa-reports), qa-publish.
- Measured ceiling: 24 of the 40 merges before 2026-10-07 20:00Z had a green run on the merged head before the merge. Runs made before this change carry no tested-tree record, so reuse starts after merge.
- On PR runs the job is skipped instantly (observed on run 37683602404), so e2e and standalone do not wait for it.
- Evidence still owed: one main push after merge showing reuse or a stated no-reuse.

_2026-10-07_: verdict-reuse.sh exercised on 5 paths against a stubbed API, and its job filter against the real API (8/8 on run 37659324493). verdict-reuse was skipped with 0 s queue on PR run 37683602404. Awaiting a main push after merge.

## Completed on landed evidence
Landed on main in PR #2457 (commit `86ad61f3976b`, "ci(qbco): cancel superseded main runs; reuse a green verdict when main's tree was already tested").
- Concurrency group per ref on push cancels superseded runs.
- `verdict-reuse` job and `cat-harness/scripts/verdict-reuse.sh` active in `code-quality-gates.yml`.
- Verified active on main post-merge pushes.
