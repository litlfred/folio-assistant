Issue #1767. Owner 2026-10-01: landing page for /smart-base/; push generic stuff into fhir-harness first; staged smart-base, smart-trust (and smart-immunizations) belong in litlfred forks.

## Done when
Staged per cat-harness/docs/proposals/smart-separation-2026-10-01.md (owner decided Q1-a, Q2-a, Q3-b, Q5 reframed as qvxh).
- [x] A1 gen-smart-trust-pages -> fhir-harness/scripts/gen-ig-pages.ts; smart-trust output byte-identical (681 pages)
- [x] A2 smart-base docs/ with --summary landing page; tile now /smart-base/
- [x] A3 split plan written, questions asked and answered
- [x] A4 PR #1768 green  — merged 2026-10-01T16:21:51Z, merge commit `80434b7ec3`.
  Ticked on a JUDGEMENT that is stated so it can be disputed: its head carried 16
  check runs with one failure, `cleanup`. That is housekeeping, not a gate — gates
  here are suffixed `(hard)` or `(warn-only)` and `cleanup` is skipped on most
  runs — so every gate was green, which is what this box means by green. Had the
  red been a gate this box would have stayed open.
- [ ] B fhir-harness takes generic ingest/schemas; wrong-direction edges 1-4 fixed; 4 generic Tool nodes
- [ ] C fhir-harness visualizer: fhir-artifact-index kind viewer per instance; neutral sidecar overlay
- [ ] D smart-base consolidated (theme, chrome re-key, needs repointed); L1/DAK kinds = qvxh
- [ ] E forks seeded (harness at litlfred/smart-base root; data under smart-base/)
- [ ] F f-a subscribes; cutover only on owner OK
