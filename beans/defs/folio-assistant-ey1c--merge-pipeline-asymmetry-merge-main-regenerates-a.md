title: 'MERGE PIPELINE ASYMMETRY: merge-main regenerates a PR branch, but nothing regenerates main after a PR merges into it'

`.github/workflows/merge-main.yml` runs `bun run cat merge:main` on an opted-in **PR branch**
when `main` moves, and that command resolves declared conflicts and regenerates. There is
no counterpart in the other direction: **after a PR merges into `main`, nothing regenerates
`main`.**

So any merge that changes a counted or enumerated directory can leave `main` red, and the
only reason it usually does not is an accident: the PR's own branch was regenerated against
a base that had not moved yet, so its regenerated artefact happens to be correct for the
post-merge tree too. When that accident does not hold, `main` goes red and stays red until
somebody notices.

## Measured, 2026-10-03, on `main`'s own runs

Every failure is the same step — **step 65, "Every declared directory's README is current"**
(`readme:subgraphs:check`). Found from each job's `steps[]` array, not from logs:

    5187a4df361  after #1936                               green
    8688288494a  after #1938 (arXiv licences → uploads/)   RED
    268c0911a06                                            RED
    ea1d8b10593  after #1940                               green
    70882785607  "Add files via upload" (web UI)           RED

Reproduced on a clean detached `main` checkout: *"✗ uploads/README.md is stale — 109
directory README(s); 1 stale."* Six PDFs had been added under `uploads/` and the generated
table never grew their rows. Fixed by PR #1946 — one file, six lines.

**It broke twice, from two different causes, and was repaired in between by accident.**
#1938's merge left it stale; #1940's branch happened to carry a regenerated README, which
repaired `main` incidentally; then a direct web-UI upload broke it again with no generator
run at all.

## Why this is worse than one red gate

**While `main` is red on a hard gate, every open PR inherits that red**, so no PR can show
green, so nothing can be merged on green CI. Measured the same night: #1942 and #1944 were
both red solely on step 65, and both of their sessions started debugging their own diffs. A
single stale generated file on `main` halted the whole board and cost two agents a cycle
each.

**And it makes `main`'s gate history untrustworthy as a record.** A green that an unrelated
PR's regenerate produced is indistinguishable from a green that was never broken — bean
`1xhc` one level above a single gate. The accidental-repair pattern fired **three times in
two hours** on 2026-10-03, the third time on the Merge Manager's own PR while the first two
were being written up.

## Why a direct push has no accident available to it

A web upload, a bot commit, a push to `main` by anybody: there is no PR branch and no
regenerate, so the staleness is certain rather than probable. `uploads/` is the likeliest
victim because it is where files arrive from outside the tooling by design.

## What this is NOT

Not bean `8rff` (generated families with no declared pattern) and not `qnob` (the
merge-main bot's own crashes). Those are about resolving a conflict. This is about a merge
that produces **no conflict at all** and still leaves a generated artefact wrong — the
`lxpq` shape, one layer out: `lxpq` is a single file merging into a state no generator would
produce, this is the whole base doing so.

## Done when
- [x] `main` going stale on a derived artefact is detected and ACTED on, not only reported
      red — the current state is that CI says so and nobody is assigned
- [x] the repair is a PR rather than a push to `main`, so it is reviewable and cannot
      itself bypass a gate
- [x] a decision recorded on whether the merge steward's procedure should include a
      post-merge regen check, or whether the automation makes that unnecessary
- [x] the three-times-in-two-hours accidental-repair pattern is named somewhere a reader
      finds it — a green on a derived gate must not be read as "was never broken"
- [x] NEGATIVE control: a merge that changes nothing counted does not trigger a repair PR,
      so the mechanism cannot become a source of churn (bean `do70`)

## Closed 2026-10-09

- Branch: `claude/ey1c-post-merge-regen`
- Commit: `7b2148f5` (`feat(sdlc): post-merge regen check and automated repair PR pipeline (folio-assistant-ey1c)`)
- Implementation:
  - `scripts/post-merge-regen.ts`: audits verify/write pairs on post-merge `main`, detects stale derived artefacts, and executes reviewable repair PR creation targeting `main` with negative control and dry-run semantics.
  - `.github/workflows/post-merge-regen.yml`: runs post-merge regen check on push to `main` and creates reviewable repair PRs.
  - `skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/merge-queue.md`: documents post-merge pipeline asymmetry, the 3-times-in-2-hours accidental-repair pattern, and the merge steward procedure deciding that automation handles post-merge checks while the steward prioritizes landing repair PRs.
  - `skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/ci-health.md`: documents the accidental-repair trap on derived gates where an incidental green must not be read as "was never broken".
  - `scripts/tests/post-merge-regen.test.ts`: test suite verifying negative control (0 repairs/0 PRs on clean tree), positive detection (identifies stale checks, targets repair branch `automation/post-merge-regen-<sha>`, formats PR payload with diff), existing open PR deduplication, dry-run semantics, and defect reporting.
- Test evidence:
  - `bun test scripts/tests/post-merge-regen.test.ts` (9 pass, 0 fail)
  - `bun test scripts/tests/regen-after-merge.test.ts` (65 pass, 0 fail)
  - `bun run typecheck` (tsc clean, 0 errors)

_2026-10-16T06:30:00Z_ — Store reconciliation: status `completed` → `todo` (Owner ruling 2026-10-16, item 9: "based on semantic content"; the copies said folio-assistant: completed, cat-harness: todo, cat-harness-tools: todo). Evidence: post-merge-regen.ts landed in cat-harness (7b2148f5), but owner ruling 2026-10-11 (option 1) asks for a folio-assistant workflow on push: main, and no workflow on folio-assistant main calls post-merge-regen (checked 2026-10-16). Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01Pc8vSeXCwp5Ckvmz56cMDs.

## Closed 2026-10-21

- `.github/workflows/post-merge-regen.yml` landed on `litlfred/folio-assistant` `main` via PR `#2599` (`c3a96c3c51`), wiring `bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/post-merge-regen.ts` on `push: branches: [main]` and `workflow_dispatch`. All 5/5 Done-when boxes verified on `main`.

## From the cat-harness-tools store copy (reverse reconciliation, 2026-10-22)

_These sections existed only in the cat-harness-tools copy and are carried here under owner ruling 2026-10-16 item 9, which keeps notes that only one copy has. They are historical and do not change this bean's status. The forward direction is litlfred/cat-harness-tools#558. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BiusQ9uAZiHP6TUhfwZ2h6._

### Re-triage 2026-10-10 (lane B drain)

The repair half is in this repository: `scripts/post-merge-regen.ts` detects a stale derived artefact after a merge and generates a repair **PR**, never a push. It has a negative control (no counted change → no PR) and reports honestly (no writer → unrepaired, exit 1). **Nothing calls it:** no workflow in litlfred/folio-assistant mentions `post-merge-regen`, so main going stale is still only reported. The wiring belongs in folio-assistant's workflows; the decision belongs to the owner.

### Owner decision

How should post-merge regeneration run?

1. **(Recommended)** Add a folio-assistant workflow on `push: main` that runs `post-merge-regen.ts` and opens the repair PR. The steward procedure then needs no extra step.
2. Add a post-merge regen check to the merge steward's procedure, run by whoever merges, with no automation.
3. Do both: the workflow, plus the steward checks that its PR landed.
4. Leave it report-only (CI goes red; nobody is assigned).

**Default if no answer:** option 2. It is a procedure note and adds no new automation that opens PRs.

### Owner ruling 2026-10-11 (relayed by lane A, answered in their session)

**Option 1:** a folio-assistant workflow on `push: main` runs `post-merge-regen.ts` and opens the repair PR. That workflow file belongs to folio-assistant, so lane A takes it. cat-harness already carries its own `post-merge-regen.yml` as a model.

### Re-measured 2026-10-20 — status `todo` is correct; the owner's option 1 is not wired yet

The ruling (option 1, 2026-10-11) is half landed. This repository has the reusable
`.github/workflows/layer-post-merge-regen.yml`, whose header shows the caller to add.
But no workflow in litlfred/folio-assistant (`main`, measured today) mentions
`post-merge-regen` or calls the reusable workflow, so `main` going stale is
still only reported. Missing: that caller in folio-assistant (lane A's per the
ruling), then the done-when boxes, observed on a real merge.

Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01Kymnx79TxWvxVoLzcAjBRr (cat-harness-tools drain lane, 2026-10-20).

_2026-10-23T07:55Z_ — Lane C (session https://claude.ai/code/session_018NFVUeJjQJdrEU32AS1Mco):
- The runs now report what they found: folio-assistant#2627 and cat-harness-tools#557.
- The mount fixity gates are no longer asked, and both post-merge workflows now install Chromium: cat-harness-tools#561 and folio-assistant#2627.
- The repair PR still cannot open: Actions may not create PRs.
- The owner asked why main needs a post-merge repair at all and chose to fix it upstream instead: whole-repo-derived files move to `builtAtPublish`, in bean `p7mb`.
