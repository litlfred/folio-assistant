title: kg-skills glossary stale on main since 2c295f8ac06 — and CI reads the MERGE, which is why no local probe saw it

## What was measured, 2026-09-26, on PR #1405

CI step 15 of the `gates` job — `glossary page and SKOS` — failed on `ba7af05f6a1`:

    ✗ stale: cat-harness/docs/glossary/skills/index.md
    ✗ stale: cat-harness/docs/assets/glossary/cat-harness--kg-skills.skos.jsonld
    ✗ stale: folio-assistant-core/glossary/generated/cat-harness/kg-skills.glossary.json
    Run `bun run glossary:page` and commit the result.

**It is the `kg-skills` glossary, and I cannot reproduce it.**

| probe | result |
|---|---|
| `check:glossary` in the working checkout at that exact commit, tree clean | **PASS** |
| `glossary:pot:check` same | PASS |
| `bun run glossary:page` then `git status` | **empty** — the generator reproduces what is committed |
| `check:glossary` in a detached throwaway worktree at the same commit, **no `_kg/`**, no nested `block-qa-schema/node_modules` | **PASS** |
| CI, step 15, same commit | **FAIL** |

So two local environments — one of them deliberately stripped of the residue that has explained every other CI/local disagreement today — agree with the committed artefacts, and the runner does not.

### What makes it strange rather than merely environmental

The **previous** head, `00ba25c5b26`, passed step 15 in CI nine minutes earlier. Verified from the step list rather than inferred from job duration, because I had first guessed it from the 38s-vs-19s runtime and that is not evidence.

The entire diff between those two commits is **+24 lines in `cat-harness/test/navbar-row.e2e.ts`** — a comment and one `page.mouse.move`. Nothing in a KG directory, nothing a skills glossary should read.

    git diff --stat 00ba25c5b26 ba7af05f6a1
     cat-harness/test/navbar-row.e2e.ts | 24 ++++++++++++++++++++++++

### Hypotheses NOT adopted, and why each was dropped

- **Residue** (`_kg/`, nested `node_modules`) — the throwaway worktree had neither and still passed. This is the explanation that fits every other case today and it does not fit this one.
- **Nondeterministic file ordering in the generator** — would fail on every CI run, not the second of two nine minutes apart.
- **The comment introduced a glossary term** — then the local generator would produce a diff. It produces none.

Naming a mechanism without the run is what  warns about in its own *"What is NOT claimed"*, and this session has already corrected two plausible-sounding causes stated with the authority of a measurement. So: **could not determine.**

### What would settle it

The generated content CI produced. Nothing available to this session prints it — the Actions log gives the three `✗ stale` lines and no diff, and re-running a job is not in reach here. A `--check` that printed the first differing line, or wrote the regenerated file as an artefact, would have answered this in one read instead of five probes.

## Done when

- [ ] Someone reproduces it, or the next CI run on a fresh commit shows it transient
- [ ] If it recurs: `glossary-page.ts --check` reports WHAT differs, not only THAT something does
- [ ] If it is environment-dependent, the dependency is named — the three artefacts are committed, so whichever environment is wrong is publishing a wrong glossary


## ANSWERED, and the bean's own premise is withdrawn — 2026-09-26

**There was no CI-vs-local disagreement.** This workflow triggers on
`pull_request`, so `actions/checkout` gives it **the merge of the PR head with
main**, not the PR head. Its own `on:` block says so:

> The MERGE QUEUE — bean `nytj`. A pull_request run tests the PR merged with
> main AS IT WAS WHEN THE PR WAS PUSHED

So CI was reading a tree containing main's `2c295f8ac06` ("fix: update 59 stale
script paths in skills after repo restructuring") and every local probe was
reading one that predated it. Two different trees, one commit id quoted for
both. That is why every environmental hypothesis failed: there was no
environment difference to find.

**The defect itself is one term.** `2c295f8ac06` edited
`cat-harness/skills/folio-paper-adapter/latex-build-cache.md`'s front-matter
`description`, `scripts/install-tex.sh` -> `cat-harness/scripts/install-tex.sh`
(twice), and that description is PROJECTED into the three artefacts named above.
It did not regenerate them. Fixed by `bun run glossary:page` in `bc6c84a5166`.

Measured after merging main into this branch: the three failures reproduced
byte-for-byte on the first try, the regeneration touched exactly those three
files and nothing else, and `check:glossary` is green — 2560 extracted terms
against 2549 pre-merge, the 11 being skills main added and none of them this.

## What the three wrong hypotheses have in common

Residue, nondeterministic ordering, and \"the comment added a term\" were all
guesses about the RUNNER. The measurement that would have settled it in one step
was not another probe of my container: it was asking what tree CI checked out.

**The rule worth carrying: a local gate run on a branch head and a CI gate run
on the same branch are not runs of the same tree, and the difference is
invisible from a checkout.** `check:merged` exists precisely because of this
(bean `nytj`) — and running it here would have found this without a single
hypothesis.

## Done when

- [x] the three stale artefacts are explained by a named commit
- [x] regenerated and green on the merged tree
- [x] the premise \"CI and local disagree on one tree\" is withdrawn in place,
      not edited away
