Arc 3fva proposes ContentDirectory.storage {branch, keyedBy: commit} for qa-reports. State needs keyedBy: tip (one living tree, splice-write, never -f). One field, one library — a second field over the same question is two answers free to disagree.

## Done when
- [x] 3fva owner session consulted (PR #1764, comment 2026-10-02)
- [ ] field shape agreed: 3fva's {branch, keyedBy} widened to commit|tip, no path field (proposed on #1764; agreed when it lands without objection)
- [ ] library API agreed: extract qa-store's Store into branch-store.ts after #1764 lands (proposed on #1764)

Proposal: cat-harness/docs/proposals/state-branch-2026-10-02.md
