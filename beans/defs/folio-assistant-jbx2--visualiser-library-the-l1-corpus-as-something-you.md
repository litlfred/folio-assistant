Owner, 2026-09-20: *"we also need library/ harness visualation"*, and
*"bean up to do: library/ visualaiont. the fsh-gts/ has visualion beaned up
already/in-progress."*

## Why this one first among the missing viewers

`library/` is L1 — every knowledge-graph reference to a source resolves THROUGH
it, never to a loose path or a bare URL. So it is the subgraph whose contents
most consumers depend on, and the one nobody can currently look at. Its sibling
`uploads/` is the queue feeding it, and the two are deliberately separate
declarations precisely because a source sitting in `uploads/` "reads as absent
to every consumer while the file is on disk" — a distinction a viewer should
make visible rather than leave to prose.

## What it has to show, from what is actually there

A `library/<bib-slug>/` holds `sections/*.md`, `structure.json`, and — where the
source was scanned — `ocr/page-NNN.txt`. So the honest view is per slug:

- what the source IS (title, the declaration that named it),
- how far ingestion got (sections? structure? OCR, or none because it was never
  scanned — which is a third state, not a failure),
- what REFERENCES it, since resolving through `library/` is the whole point,
- and what is in `uploads/` that has NOT become a slug yet, which is the queue
  the corpus checklist cannot see.

## Related, deliberately not merged into this

`fsh-guts/` already has a visualisation beaned and in progress — a different
subgraph with a different shape (the trashcan, where `movedFrom` is the field
that earns its keep). Sharing a renderer between them is a decision for whoever
builds the second one, not an assumption for the first.

## Done when

- [ ] `library/` renders per slug, with ingestion state as THREE states rather
      than a tick or a cross.
- [ ] `uploads/` entries that have not become slugs are visible as such.
- [ ] It resolves at least one real reference through a slug, so the "everything
      resolves through here" property is demonstrated rather than asserted.
