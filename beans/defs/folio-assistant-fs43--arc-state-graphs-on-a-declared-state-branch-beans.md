Owner 2026-10-02: a special branch for state-based KG content (todos, beans), declared as a sub-graph, as a general practice for managing a KG and its generated content (rendered content = sub-graph linking back to the primary content graph). Review processes and adjust.

Proposal, inventory, workplan and decisions D1-D4: cat-harness/docs/proposals/state-branch-2026-10-02.md.
Generalises arc 3fva (qa-reports branch, issue #1763, PRs #1764/#1801) — shares its 'storage' field and write library rather than competing.

## Done when
- [x] owner has ruled D1-D4 (2026-10-02, all defaults)
- [ ] storage field + branch-store library agreed with 3fva
- [ ] every reader/writer in proposal section 4 reads the branch, gates green
- [ ] moved files removed from main on the owner's explicit go
- [ ] gh-pages and lake-cache declared with the same field
