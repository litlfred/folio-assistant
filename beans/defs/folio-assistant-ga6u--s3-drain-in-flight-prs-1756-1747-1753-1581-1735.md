## 2026-10-01 late — #1735 / qsx4

Owner ruling (earlier, recorded on #1735, 16:26Z) re-affirmed: **the outdated `dependents` prose in the who-iris files is reworded NOW**, in #1735's merge — who-iris.json's `_dependents_comment` on who-iris-themes, the who-iris-docs `_comment`, and the `qa` description — each describing the current mechanism (the graph kind's `perInstance` and nested subgraphs declared with `"subgraph": true`). The same stale wording in the ~15 other declarations stays out of scope there. Consistent with the Q-B ruling (Q1: REWORD) on `zhg2`.

Bean `qsx4` exists only on #1735's branch, so this is recorded here and on the PR rather than by creating its file on main (an add/add conflict for #1735).
