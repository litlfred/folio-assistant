Story S5 (txue), with 70lx. Rows: cat-harness/docs/proposals/placement-audit-2026-10-01.json (PR #1778) — pr '(tool placement; S5 70lx carries implementations)': cat-harness -> sci 18, -> core 3, -> fhir-harness 1; smart-base -> fhir-harness 1. MCP rulings: generic MCP skills -> cat-harness/skills/tools/mcp/, folio-specific MCP -> folio-assistant-core/skills/tools/mcp/ and folio-assistant-core/tools/; folio-init SPLIT (mer2).
## Done when
- [ ] rows moved; MCP server lists the same tool set; gates green; merged

## State 2026-10-09
Re-derived from `placement-audit-2026-10-01.json` against the post-split mount: **23 of 23** rows tagged `unplanned (tool placement; S5 70lx carries implementations)` are still at their original path. Blocker `70lx` is completed. `cat-harness/skills/folio-core/` still holds the MCP skills the MCP ruling places under `skills/tools/mcp/`. Not started; now cross-repository.
