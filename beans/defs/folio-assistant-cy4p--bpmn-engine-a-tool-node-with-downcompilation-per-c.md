**Uncaptured owner requirement, found 2026-09-19T17:0x** while checking
[#363](https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/issues/363) for replies.
The ask was made at 09:20 and had reached no bean in eight hours — the
`issue-working` re-check is what surfaced it, which is the case that skill
exists for.

Owner, [#363 comment](https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/issues/363#issuecomment-5740727385):

> as part of tools, if bpmn-engine (including skills to downcompile to
> different languages per coding agent need).

## Two halves

**The engine as a Tool node.** BPMN execution already exists here —
`workflow_start` / `workflow_next` / `workflow_complete` over
`src/workflow/`, with state committed under `beans/workflows/`. What does
not exist is a **Tool** declaration for it. "as part of tools" reads as:
the engine should be a first-class node other instances can discover and
depend on, not an implementation detail of this repo's MCP server.

**Downcompilation "per coding agent need".** The harder half, and the one
to scope before building. Different coding agents consume instructions in
different forms, so a diagram may need emitting AS something a given agent
can follow — a skill body, a checklist, a state machine in its own config
format. This is a generator FROM the BPMN, not a second source of truth.

## The trap this must not fall into

**A downcompiled artefact is a rendering, never an authority.** The moment
one can be edited and fed back, there are two answers to "what is the
process" and they are free to disagree. That is `render:bpmn`'s existing
discipline — the SVGs are generated and `render:bpmn:check` fails if
stale — and the same must hold here, including a staleness gate.

## Before drawing anything

Ask what a target agent actually cannot do with the diagram today. If the
answer is "read XML", the fix may be a projection rather than a compiler.

## Done when

- [ ] the scope question above is answered: which agents, needing what form
- [ ] the engine is declared as a Tool node and the declaration is audited
      by `kg:audit`
- [ ] any downcompiled artefact is generated, with a `--check` gate, and
      carries in its own text that it is generated

## Owner ruling (2026-10-10, drain session ml9h)

**Both:** (1) declare the engine as a Tool node now; (2) generate a checklist projection per diagram. Owner asked how an agent following a checklist takes the BPMN edges correctly — the answer (below) is the design to build to.

### How a checklist follows the edges

The checklist is NOT a flat list; it is the diagram walked as a state machine, with the engine still the authority:

1. **Each task is a step that names its outgoing edge(s).** A step ends with 'next: <task id>' — the sequence flow written out, so the agent never infers order from position.
2. **Each gateway is a decision step, not a step to do.** Exclusive gateway → 'Decide: <condition A> → go to X; <condition B> → go to Y', the conditions copied from the flow's conditionExpression (or the DMN it calls, by id). Parallel gateway → 'Do all of X, Y; join at Z before continuing'.
3. **Events become entry/exit lines:** start event = 'Begin here when…', end events = 'Done — record completion', boundary/timer events = 'If <trigger> while in this step → go to …'.
4. **The agent records where it is.** Every step says which workflow_next / workflow_complete call to make, so the engine's committed state under beans/workflows/ — not the agent's memory of the list — says which edge was taken. A wrong turn is then visible and refusable.
5. **Generated and gated.** The checklist is emitted from the .bpmn, says so in its own text, and a :check fails when it is stale, so it can never become a second source of truth.

For an agent with no MCP, steps 1–3 are enough to walk the graph by hand; step 4 is what makes the walk auditable.

## Assigned (2026-10-10 17:5x UTC, drain ml9h)

Owner asked lane A to dispatch more to lane B; assigned to lane B (session_01QmRtjQNyHiH2RuimTfuJDu), whose repo (litlfred/cat-harness-tools) holds the code. Lane A will not start it.

## Summary of Changes

Done by drain lane B on the owner's ruling (Tool node + checklist projection): cat-harness-tools#106 (bpmn-checklist generator + :check; 98 diagrams render) and cat-harness#132 (bpmn-engine Tool node with inProcess registrar + workflow_* MCP arm; bpmn-checklist Tool node). Committing the generated checklists waits on a registered regen writer (follow-up).
