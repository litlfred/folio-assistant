Owner ruling 2026-10-06: the merge guard's same-session separation (check 2) applies only if a Merge Manager is active; none is now; durable, not per session. Add --no-merge-manager to merge-guard.ts, tests, and merge-queue skill section incl. the cloud fallback (read the merge-guard commit status on the exact head when gh cannot run).
