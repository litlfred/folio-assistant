Owner, 2026-09-22, ruling on #596's ruling 2: **"DCAT: hold as bean as render of whatever we land on."**

So this is deliberately NOT built, and the reason is in the ruling's own words: DCAT renders *whatever we land on*, so building it before the term model is settled would render a moving target.

## What DCAT is and is not

**Not a term model.** It describes a `dcat:Dataset` and its `dcat:Distribution`s — a published, versioned, discoverable thing with a licence, a download URL and a media type. That is the one question SKOS and FHIR both answer badly, and it is complementary to both rather than competing with either.

Recorded in [`vocabulary-authority`](../../cat-harness/skills/folio-core/vocabulary-authority.md): a release of any authoritative vocabulary is DCAT's subject.

## What it would describe here, once there is something to describe

- `_kg/<instance>-glossary.jsonld` and its per-locale siblings — already emitted, already versioned by the ledger's `firstSeen` / `retiredOn`
- `_kg/<instance>.jsonld` and `ns/*.jsonld`
- a folio's FHIR terminology artefacts, if the folio publishes them

## Done when

- [ ] The term model is settled enough that a release has stable boundaries
- [ ] Decide whether DCAT is EMITTED or only referenced — `external-schemas/` can pin the edition without this repo producing any `dcat:Dataset`
- [ ] If emitted: one `dcat:Dataset` per published graph document, with `dcat:distribution` per serialisation and per locale
- [ ] `check:invocation-parity` extended — a preview that publishes a dataset description must publish the distribution it names, the same failure `inScheme` already has

## Not this bean

The authoritative-scheme question is answered: SKOS for meaning, DC for resources, FHIR for clinical codes. DCAT sits beside all three and arbitrates none of them.

## Summary of Changes

Closed 2026-09-23. The owner chose **"Reference only"**.

- **Record added:** `cat-harness/external-schemas/w3c-dcat-3.json`, pinning DCAT 3 (W3C Recommendation, 2024-08-22), namespace `http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#`, `use: "cites"`, with no operative terms. Nothing emits a DCAT term, and this bean does not change that.
- **Report wording changed:** `external-schemas.ts` now words a `cites` namespace that nothing uses as *"cited AHEAD of use — pinned by decision"*. It was *"a record outliving its dependency"*, whose remedy (drop the record) would have undone this decision.
- **Checks:** `external-schemas:check` passes, and the external-schemas viewer was regenerated.
- **Still open, deliberately:** emitting a `dcat:Dataset` per released graph document waits on a settled term model. DCAT is also one more target vocabulary for the ETL Tools of bean `k74z`.

## 2026-09-24 — the pinned edition lives HERE now

The external-schema record `w3c-dcat-3` (DCAT Version 3, W3C Recommendation
2024-08-22, https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/REC-vocab-dcat-3-20240822/, namespace
`http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#`) is retired to
`fsh-guts/retired/external-schema-w3c-dcat-3.md`. Main's #1168 B6a requires
each record to have a file that declares `conformsTo` it, and nothing here
emits DCAT yet. The edition choice is not lost: it is the one above. Re-add
the record when the first DCAT term is emitted.
