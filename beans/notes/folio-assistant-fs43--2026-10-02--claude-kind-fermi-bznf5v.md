## handover: fs43 state-branch + #1764 merge 2026-10-02

## Handover report: fs43 state-branch arc + #1764 merge (session_01KC89Knbbj8V6YL6Hrr7kk1)

- **Session:** https://claude.ai/code/session_01KC89Knbbj8V6YL6Hrr7kk1
- **Written:** 2026-10-02 ~20:50 UTC, at the owner's request: *"Use skill Prepare for Handover … send to Merge Manager"*.
- **Role and mandate:**
  - Issue #1850 has three parts: the beans page light-mode chip, a freshness stamp, and state graphs on a declared `state` branch (epic `fs43`).
  - Owner rulings, verbatim:
    - *"go with defaults for D1-D4"*;
    - *"start Phase 2 after #1764 merges"*;
    - *"go ahead and seed the state branch too"*;
    - *"merge #1764 and start Phase 2"*;
    - on the `kg:export:check` collision, *"Keep both, two names"*;
    - on the moved attestations, *"Move them to new paths"*.

### Where I'm going (current arc)
Epic `fs43`: move process-written state (beans, workflow instances, todos, issue-marks, health results) off `main` onto one declared `state` branch, reusing arc `3fva`'s `storage` field and `qa-store` plumbing.

Phase 2 (bean `2h76`) has four parts:
- extract `qa-store.ts`'s generic `Store` and `writeLoop` into `branch-store.ts`;
- widen `DirectoryStorageSchema.keyedBy` to `commit | tip`;
- add `state-store.ts`;
- add a session-start mount.

It is gated on #1764 (arc 3fva) merging, because #1764 ships `DirectoryStorageSchema` and `qa-store.ts`.

### Done so far
- **#1851 merged** as `9eecdc6`. It contains:
  - the light-mode chip fix (bean `atlf`);
  - the "Generated … · N commits behind main" stamp (bean `r6es`), using a `build.json` that the deploy writes, so nothing timestamped is committed;
  - proposal `cat-harness/docs/proposals/state-branch-2026-10-02.md`;
  - epic `fs43` and phase beans `8ez4` `laqs` `2h76` `9ofm` `0tg5` `89cl` `p3ny` `rva2`.
- **Verified live:** `gh-pages` `a7bd7b1` carries `build.json` (built from `main@0e20a22`, at 16:16 UTC) and the new beans page. The GitHub compare API answered "identical". `atlf` and `r6es` are closed in this commit.
- **D1–D4 ruled, all defaults** (bean `laqs`, completed).
- **Phase 0** (bean `8ez4`): the agreement is posted on #1764. #1764 lands unchanged; Phase 2 then extracts `Store` and widens `keyedBy`. There is no `path` field.
- **`state` branch seeded:** `d913ea4`, an orphan, from `main@85b9578`.
  - Each directory's tree id was verified equal to `main`'s from a cold clone.
  - `manifest.json` says `status: seed, authoritative: false`.
  - Commands are recorded on bean `2h76`.

### Next in queue
1. **Finish #1764's merge.** Draft PR #1916 (`claude/kind-fermi-1764-merge-wip` → `claude/quirky-davinci-ixuymr`, head `43ea90c`).
   - Apply the attestation move (steps in #1916's body).
   - Re-run `kg:audit:check`, `kg:audit:all:check` and `skill:register:check`.
   - Merge `main` again (it moves 20–50 commits per half hour), then merge #1916 into #1764 and #1764 into `main`.
2. **Phase 2** (bean `2h76`), on a fresh branch from `main` once #1764 has landed.
3. **Re-seed `state` at cutover** (Phase 3, bean `9ofm`). The seed is stale as soon as beans change on `main`.

### In flight
| item | kind | state | next action | owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `claude/kind-fermi-1764-merge-wip` @ `43ea90c` | branch + draft PR #1916 | `kg:audit` red: 10 attestations at pre-move paths | move them to the new paths (owner ruling), then merge into #1764 | next agent / Merge Manager |
| #1764 `claude/quirky-davinci-ixuymr` @ `8df0a71` (my last push there) | PR | CI red on `8df0a71` (`check:artefact-verification`, fixed in `07f7401`, which is inside #1916); conflicting with `main` again | merge #1916 into it | its session or the Merge Manager |
| `state` @ `d913ea4` | special branch | seed, not authoritative | the Merge Manager renames it to `cat-state` (bean `32f6`, PR #1913); nothing writes it until Phase 3 | Merge Manager |
| bean `2h76` | bean | todo; waits on #1764 | start Phase 2 | next agent |
| issue #1850 | issue | open; parts 1 and 2 are done, part 3 is in progress | owner closes it | owner |

### Blockers and dependencies
| blocker | waits on | since | expires / re-check |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 2 (`2h76`) | #1764 merged to `main` | 2026-10-02 12:30 UTC | re-check at each #1764 event |
| #1764 mergeable | attestation move plus a fresh merge of `main` | 2026-10-02 19:00 UTC | `main` moves roughly every 30 minutes; merge and push in one go |

### Decisions pending (owner)
- None open. All the rulings needed for the next steps are listed above.

### Unpushed or at-risk state
- **Worktree `/home/user/wt-1764`:** everything is pushed (`43ea90c`); nothing is left only locally.
- **Scratchpad:** regen and gates logs only. They are reproducible with `bun run regen` (about 26–36 minutes) and `bun run gates` (about 24 minutes, and it needs a real `node_modules`, not a symlink).
- **No background jobs running.**

### How to resume
1. `git fetch origin claude/kind-fermi-1764-merge-wip` and check out a worktree at `43ea90c`. Use a real `bun install`, not a symlinked `node_modules`, or `gates` refuses to run.
2. Do the 10-attestation move. The list is in #1916's body; the diagram contents are byte-identical, so only paths change. Run `kg:audit:check`, merge `origin/main`, run `bun run regen`, then push.
3. When #1764 is on `main`, start bean `2h76`. Write to `cat-state`, not `state`, if the rename has happened.
