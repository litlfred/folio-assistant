## What

Generate a narrative description for every image, localized to the folio's
languages.

## The half that is easy to miss

**This applies to an image EXTRACTED FROM A PDF, not only to an uploaded one.**
Most images in this corpus arrive inside a paper, and a figure nobody has
described is a figure no grep and no agent can reach.

## Provenance is not optional

Every description carries its author — human, or agent **with model version**.
See `folio-assistant-iqim`. An uncited narrative is indistinguishable from a
transcription of the source, and the two have very different standing.

## Done when

Each image in `manifest.jsonld` has a description per configured language, each
stamped with its author, and the PDF-extraction path produces them too.

Diagram: `docs/workflows/ingest-derive-content.bpmn`, `Task_Image`.
