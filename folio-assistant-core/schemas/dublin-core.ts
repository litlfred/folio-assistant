/**
 * Qualified Dublin Core, as a graph node.
 *
 * @module schemas/dublin-core
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## Why this is in the content layer and not in `who-iris/`
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20: *"break up working bits (like .ts record for dublin
 * core) etc. fully worked for the three examples"*, and in the same breath
 * *"mionimal tools in who specific stuff."* Dublin Core is ISO 15836 and
 * DSpace is a repository platform; neither is WHO's. What IS WHO's is how IRIS
 * *uses* them — three identifier systems, MeSH as the subject vocabulary, a
 * legacy handle kept alive after a server merge — and that lives in the
 * `who-iris` instance's skill, beside the three records themselves.
 *
 * The line is the one {@link module:schemas/folio-graph-kind} already draws:
 * the layer that owns a vocabulary is the layer that can serve it to anybody.
 *
 * ## Qualified, repeatable, language-tagged — and all three are load-bearing
 *
 * This type is shaped by ONE measured record, not by a reading of the DC spec.
 * The full item record for `wpr-rdo-2020-003-eng`, extracted with `pdftotext`
 * on 2026-09-20, does all three of the things a naive model forbids:
 *
 *   - **Qualified.** Every field is `element.qualifier`: `dc.date.accessioned`,
 *     `dc.identifier.govdoc`, `dc.subject.mesh`, `dc.description.abstract`. A
 *     model keyed on the fifteen simple elements cannot address any of them.
 *   - **Repeated.** FOUR fields occur twice in that one record — two
 *     `dc.date.accessioned`, two `dc.date.available`, two `dc.identifier.uri`,
 *     two `dc.subject.mesh`. `Record<string, string>` silently keeps the last
 *     and drops the rest, and the ones it would drop are a real alternate
 *     identifier and half the subject indexing.
 *   - **Language-tagged.** The record carries a per-FIELD language column
 *     (`en` on `dc.description`, on `dc.title`, on each `dc.subject.mesh`, and
 *     conspicuously NOT on `dc.contributor.author` or the dates). The absence
 *     is data: an untagged value is not an English value, it is a value whose
 *     language nobody asserted.
 *
 * So the value type is a LIST of language-tagged values, always, even when the
 * list has one entry. A shape that is sometimes a string and sometimes an array
 * makes every consumer branch, and the consumer that forgets to branch is the
 * one that loses the second handle.
 *
 * ## What this type deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It does not resolve, validate or deduplicate. `dc.identifier.uri` appearing
 * twice is not an error to be cleaned up — in the measured record the second is
 * `http://iris.wpro.who.int/handle/10665.1/14518`, a regional IRIS instance
 * that was merged into the global one, and dropping it would discard the only
 * evidence this repository holds of a source host disappearing. Judgement about
 * which identifier is authoritative belongs to the `iris-dspace` skill, which
 * can say WHY; a schema that deduplicated would make that judgement invisibly
 * and permanently.

 * the way the `iris-dspace` skill's R1 and R2 are about.
 *
 * The measured record carries `dc.identifier.uri` TWICE and
 * `dc.identifier.govdoc` once. Those are three values from **three different
 * identifier systems** — a Handle guaranteed outside WHO, a legacy regional
 * URI kept alive after a server merge, and a WHO publication number with no
 * authority behind it. Collapsed onto one predicate they become an unordered
 * bag of three strings, and the distinction R1 exists to preserve ("resolve by
 * Handle, treat govdoc as secondary") is no longer *expressible* in the
 * projected graph. Nothing errors. The consumer just cannot ask the question.
 *
 * So: a QUALIFIED field gets its own minted IRI, keyed on the full
 * `schema.element.qualifier` spelling. A BARE field whose element is one of the
 * fifteen gets the DCMI elements IRI, because there the mapping is exact and
 * standard. Everything else is minted.

 * field and the order is meaningful, so a set would silently discard it: the
 * two `dc.identifier.uri` values would still both be present (R2 satisfied)

 *
 * ## Why `@id` is not the Handle
 *
 * R1 says a later tool should resolve by Handle. That is a JUDGEMENT about
 * which of three identifier systems is authoritative, and this module's header
 * says plainly that such judgement belongs to the `iris-dspace` skill, which
 * can explain itself, and not to a schema that would make it invisibly and
 * permanently. So `@id` is minted from `rec.id` — the repository's own key,

 * Handle-keyed nodes passes `opts.id` and owns that decision where a reader
