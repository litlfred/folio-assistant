/**
 * This instance's own namespaces, derived from its declaration.

 * Until folio-assistant#2598 (owner, 2026-10-16, "2a" and "1a") the harness
 * listed them in its `own-namespaces` code list and named this layer to do it.
 * A lower layer may not name a higher one, so the content layer registers its
 * own: `<iriBase>v<major>/ns#` from `folio-assistant-core.json`, by the one
 * rule every instance's namespace follows (`instanceNamespaceOf` in the
 * harness's `schemas/namespaces.ts`). The IRIs are byte-identical to the ones
 * the code list held, which `own-namespace.test.ts` pins.
 *
 * @module schemas/own-namespace
 * @graphNode none — two IRI constants, not a schema
