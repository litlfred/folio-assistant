/**
 * A specification this repository DEPENDS ON and does not hold.
 *
 * ## Why a record rather than a transcription
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-20: *"if you import scheam (e.g DC, ingest it through the
 * proper pipline, bean up to: OMG DMN specs, BPMN etc.)"*, and then the
 * constraint that shapes this file: *"(dont need to materalize, but should
 * reference specific version being used)"*.
 *
 * So an imported schema is `referenced`, in exactly the sense
 * `materialization.ts` means it: we know it exists, we know WHICH VERSION we
 * are conforming to, and we hold none of its bytes. That is the same posture
 * as the WHO IRIS catalogue — 1,057,223 files known, three held.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists to end
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-20, which is why this is a schema and not a README:
 *
 * - every `.bpmn` here declares `http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL`
 *   and three sibling namespaces, and **nothing in the repository said which
 *   specification that is** — no version, no title, no XSD, nothing to check a
 *   diagram against;
 * - `dublin-core.ts` was transcribed from ONE captured DSpace record. It
 *   carries the prefix string `dc` and **no namespace URI and no DCMI
 *   version**, so it records what one deployment SPELLS rather than what the
 *   standard DEFINES.
 *
 * A transcription with no cited edition cannot be checked, cannot be updated
 * deliberately, and cannot tell a reader whether a field it lacks is missing
 * or simply not in that edition.
 *
 * ## A version is part of the IDENTITY
 *
 * `{authority, id, version}` together, never `{authority, id}`. BPMN 1.2 and
 * BPMN 2.0 are different specifications that share a name, and a record that
 * cannot tell them apart is the thing this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * @graphNode schema
 * @module schemas/external-schema

     * that nothing can be said about.
