    When the extracted terms are compared with the swimlane ledgers
    Then the ledgers carry terms
    And the extracted types are exactly the asset types
    And no term comes from roles.json or from a BPMN lane
    And the index links the swimlane glossary

  @test:schemas/glossary.test.ts::extracted_KG_terms::pagesTellExtractedFromAuthored
  Scenario: the pages tell extracted from authored, and only authored terms reach schema.org
    When all pages are read

  Scenario: an authored scheme sourced in several instances with no defining source is refused, not guessed
    Given an authored scheme whose terms are sourced in two instances
    When its owner is resolved
    Then with no defining source it is an error
    And with a defining source, or one term, the owner is cat-harness-tools
    And with no terms the owner is folio-assistant-core
    And paths and IRIs are resolved to owners and repository paths as expected

  @test:schemas/glossary.test.ts::an_ordered_glossary_(owner,_2026-09-29:_logical,_not_alphabetical)::requiresOnlyEarlierTerms
  Scenario: a term may require only earlier terms of its own glossary, never itself
    When ordered glossaries with various requires are validated
    Then a term requiring an earlier term is accepted
    And a forward, self or missing requirement is refused

  @test:schemas/glossary.test.ts::a_description_naming_another_term_links_to_it_(bean_qgjh)::onlySameSchemeIdLinks
  Scenario: only an exact id of the SAME scheme links, and never the term itself
    Given a scheme with terms a and b
