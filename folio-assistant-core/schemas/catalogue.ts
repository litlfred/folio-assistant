/**
 * A remote catalogue, modelled in the graph without holding it.
 *
 * @module schemas/catalogue
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## The ask, and why it is not "import IRIS"
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20: *"in just the docs rendering, mock up the full iris
 * catalog as having been in the KG (by referenced, not slurped up, its 361.55 GB)"*
 * and *"stub out their hierachy (collections, etc,) and put this in there. as
 * if this is test import."*
 *
 * So the graph carries the SHAPE of a catalogue at full extent while holding
 * bytes for a handful of nodes. Every node declares its
 * {@link module:schemas/materialization} state, and the rendering shows the
 * difference, because a tree that looks the same whether or not the bytes are
 * there is a tree that lies about the corpus.
 *
 * ## Generic, though IRIS is the worked instance
 *
 * DSpace's containment is community → sub-community → collection → item →
 * bitstream, and every one of those words is DSpace's. This type uses
 * `container` and `item` instead, with a `flavour` naming the source system's
 * own word, for the reason `Theme` takes a `kind` rather than splitting into
 * three node types: one vocabulary with a discriminator beats three spellings
 * of "the thing that contains things". An OAI-PMH set, a Zenodo community and
 * a plain S3 prefix are the same shape; only the word differs.
 *
 * The IRIS-specific reading — that a DSpace UUID, a Handle and a WHO govdoc
 * number are three identifier systems with different authority behind them —
 * is in the `who-iris` instance's `iris-dspace` skill, where it can be argued
 * with. It is not in this schema, which would make it look like a property of
 * catalogues in general.
 *
 * ## Containment is a PATH, not a parent
 *
 * The measured breadcrumb on the one item this repository has captured is
 * *Home → 7. Regional Office for the … → Regional Office for the W… → Information
 * products*. Four levels, of which two are communities and one a collection,
 * and DSpace permits an item to be mapped into more than one collection. So
 * `parents` is a list of paths, not a single id, and a consumer walking "the"
 * parent of a node is already wrong on real data.

 * ## `reason` is required, and that is the whole point
 *
 * A blanked rectangle and a publication that never had anything there are
 * indistinguishable in the bytes, and they mean opposite things: one is a
 * decision somebody took, the other is a fact about the document. This
 * repository keeps paying for that shape — a withheld cover rendering
 * identically to an absent one, a red workflow looking exactly like a green
 * one — so the schema refuses a mask that does not say why it exists.
 *
 * It is NOT a redaction primitive for sensitive content. The bytes under a
 * mask are simply overwritten with a flat colour and the source document is
 * untouched, so anyone holding the source can see what was covered. It records
