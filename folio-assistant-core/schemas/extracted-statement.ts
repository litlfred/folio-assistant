/**
 * Statements extracted from library sources, as a list a page can be built from.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-core/schemas/extracted-statement
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * The input of the standard step `publish-extracted-statements`: every
 * statement an extraction captured from a library entry, verbatim, with the
 * source it came from. Each content type, or each folio, COLLECTS its own
 * extraction into this one shape (a guideline's recommendation rows, a DAK
 * layer's requirement candidates, a paper's quoted claims), and core does the
 * rest: resolves each source to its section, labels it, renders the page and
 * checks that the page is current.
 *
 * ## Why the source is a library reference plus an optional page
 *
 * `source` is a {@link LibraryRef} (instance, library id, section id) so a
 * statement from another instance's library resolves through that instance's
 * declaration, never through a relative path. Many extractions record the
 * PAGE a statement was read from rather than the section (a poster, a slide
 * deck, a table): `page` lets the generator find the section from the entry's
 * `structure.json` instead of every collector re-implementing that rule.
