/**
 * A reference to an L1 source — in this layer, or in another one.

 * @module folio-assistant-core/schemas/library-ref
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## The problem this exists for was predicted before it happened
 *
 * Bean `r1lz`, 2026-09-19, while deciding that the WHO documents would leave
 * for a repository of their own:
 *
 * > *"a skill derived from a source text in another repo would cite evidence
 * > its own instance cannot resolve."*
 *
 * That is exactly what `scripts/check-voices.ts` does. It resolves a
 * `libraryId` as `library/<id>/sections/<sec>.md` **against the voice's own
 * layer root**, so moving `voices/who-*.json` into `who-style-guide/` breaks
 * every citation in all three — 25 rules whose provenance was the whole point
 * of writing them.
 *
 * ## Why not a relative path
 *
 * `../<instance>/library/...` would work today and hardcodes a checkout layout
 * into content. It is the practice `AGENTS.md` opens by warning against, and
 * this repository has already paid for it twice **this week**: a `../`-prefixed
 * declaration that silently resolved outside the checkout, and a test carrying
 * five hardcoded skill directories that had been wrong for months. The whole
 * reason `folio_init` writes a builder shim is so the path to another layer
 * is written down **once**.
 *
 * So a cross-layer reference names the layer by its **declared name**,
 * and where that layer sits is discovered from declarations.
 *
 * ## The three failures this must keep apart
 *
 * A resolver that returned `undefined` for all of these would make them one
 * problem, and they need three different fixes:
 *
 *   - the **layer** is not in this checkout → add it, or fix the name;
 *   - the layer is here but declares **no `library` graph** → it is not a
 *     corpus and the citation is pointing at the wrong kind of thing;
 *   - the library and graph resolve but the **section file** is absent → the
 *     document was never ingested, or the section id is wrong.
 *
 * A fifth answer is not a failure of the citation at all: the layer keeps
 * its corpus in an **opt-in group this checkout's mount left out**
 * (cat-harness's `library/corpus/`, `cat-harness.library`, in a folio that
 * does not switch it on). Nothing here can be checked, and the lock says so,
 * so it is reported as `library-not-mounted`, a third state that a gate lists
 * rather than fails. A corpus the mount DID take and that is gone is still a
 * finding.
 *
 * **An unresolvable layer is never silently treated as local.** Falling back
 * would turn "you cited another repository's corpus and it is not here" into
 * "that section does not exist", which sends the next reader looking in the
 * wrong place entirely.
