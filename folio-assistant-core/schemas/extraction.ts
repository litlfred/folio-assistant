/**
 * What an EXTRACTION produced, and when — provenance for assets pulled out of
 * a container.
 *
 * ## The fact this exists to keep separate
 *
 * Three timestamps sit near each other and mean entirely different things:
 *
 * | | says |
 * |---|---|
 * | `dc.date.issued` | when the PUBLISHER published the work |
 * | `materializedAt` | when WE brought the bytes local (`materialization.ts`) |
 * | `extractedAt` here | when a TOOL produced this file out of something else |
 *
 * Measured on the WHO IRIS capture, 2026-09-20, which is why this is a schema
 * rather than a convention. Every one of the four captured files carries
 * `2026-09-20 07:42`-ish — the zip entries, the page PDF, the info PDF — and
 * not one of those is a date about the WORK. The style guide was published in
 * 2020. The `07:42` is the moment somebody pressed save.
 *
 * The page PDF carries `Producer: Skia/PDF m152`, which is Chrome's
 * print-to-PDF. That single string is what distinguishes "the publisher's PDF"
 * from "a screenshot of a web page shaped like a PDF" — and the difference is
 * invisible in a file listing, a byte count or a checksum.
 *
 * **An extraction timestamp is never a publication date.** Folding the two
 * would date a 2020 publication to 2026 and lose the only evidence that the
 * artefact is second-hand.
 *
 * ## Metadata, not contents
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-20: *"make sure you have zip ingestion skills to extract
 * metadata of assets into KG. don't extract contents unless explict ask by
 * user."*
 *
 * So the default product of reading a container is this record — a list of
 * what is inside, with sizes, types and digests — and NOT the files. An
 * {@link ExtractedAsset} describes an entry; `localPath` is present only where
 * the owner asked for that entry specifically, and its absence is the normal
 * state rather than a gap.
 *
 * @graphNode schema
 * @module schemas/extraction
