/**
 * `folio-glossary/v1`: a glossary as W3C SKOS. Core's `glossary` graph typology
 * (`typologies/glossary.json` declares the kind, since folio-assistant#2598).
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-23: *"put glossary into folio-assistant-core"*, *"it should be
 * part of general pracice w/ glossary/ page"*, and *"can glossary be
 * refefences to external skos schema?"*. Yes, three ways, all SKOS:
 *
 * | how | here |
 * |---|---|
 * | a local term linked to an external concept | `exactMatch` / `closeMatch` / `broadMatch` / `narrowMatch` on a {@link Term} |
 * | a glossary that lists external terms without copying them | `members`: external concept IRIs, emitted as a `skos:Collection` |
 * | a whole external scheme | the declaration's `remoteGraphs` entry with `graphTypologies: ["glossary"]`: known about, not held |
 *
 * Bean `lqo9` settled the rest before this was written, and it is followed,
 * not re-decided:
 * - **SKOS is the model**, `notation` is the code, and version and provenance
 *   sit on the scheme as Dublin Core (`hasVersion`, `modified`, `source`).
 * - **Three states, not two**: `authored`, `candidate` (extracted, not yet
 *   curated), `could-not-extract` (visible, with its reason). A candidate is
 *   not a definition, and nobody reading the page should mistake one for it.
 * - **A term's IRI lives in the instance namespace**, never in the asset that
 *   first defined it: moving the asset must not move the term.
 * - **Reuse is by membership, never by copying a definition.**
 * - **Not named `GlossaryEntry`**, which is already taken twice.
