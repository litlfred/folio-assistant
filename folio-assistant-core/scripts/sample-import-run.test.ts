/**
 * `sample-import.bpmn` driven over a fixture — bean `xlg2`'s second box.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-core/scripts/sample-import-run.test
 *
 * A later edit to the diagram, the driver or the import check goes red here.
 * The fixture is a copy of the real WPRO catalogue node, its record and its
 * held bytes, in a temp root. The workflow tools are built over the SAME
 * engine (`startInstance` / `complete`) the registered handlers use, without
 * the GitHub-vouched authorization a temp root cannot satisfy; the recorded
 * runs under `beans/workflows/` went through the real handlers.
