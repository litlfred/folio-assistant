/**
 * The onboarding path's two decision tables — moved here from
 * `cat-harness/scripts/tests/getting-started.test.ts` (bean `ho66`).
 * `folio-intent.dmn`, `pages-live-gate.dmn` and the `getting-started.bpmn`
 * they back are this instance's, so standing alone cat-harness has none of
 * them to read; the repo scan and the Pages-address tests stay there.
 *
 * What is worth testing is that the places where a wrong answer would be
 * *confidently* wrong stay honest:
 *
 *   1. `folio-intent.dmn` returns `ask` on both ambiguous filesystem states,
 *      and never invents a branch. An agent cannot route past a question the
 *      table did not ask.
 *   2. `pages-bootstrap` distinguishes a measured 404 from a failed check.
