### Replace
The replace operation allows to replace *existent* information with new one. Attempt to use the replace operation to set not yet initialized information must return an error. See [general errors on PATCH requests](patch.md)

To withdraw an item, `curl --data '[ { "op": "replace", "path": "/withdrawn", "value": true}]' -H "Authorization: Bearer ..." -H "content-type: application/json" -X PATCH ${dspace7-url}/api/core/items/${item-uuid}`.  The withdraw operation also requires an Authorization header.

For example, starting with the following item data:
```json
 "inArchive": true,
  "discoverable": true,
  "withdrawn": false,
  "lastModified": "2018-05-17T16:53:15.250+0000",
  "type": "item"
```
the withdraw operation will result in:
```json
  "inArchive": false,
  "discoverable": true,
  "withdrawn": true,
  "lastModified": "2018-05-17T16:53:15.250+0000",
  "type": "item"
```

To reinstate an item, `curl --data '[ { "op": "replace", "path": "/withdrawn", "value": false}]' -H "Authorization: Bearer ..." -H "content-type: application/json" -X PATCH ${dspace7-url}/api/core/items/${item-uuid}`.  The reinstate operation also requires an Authorization header.

For example, starting with the following item data:
```json
 "inArchive": false,
  "discoverable": true,
  "withdrawn": true,
  "lastModified": "2018-05-17T16:53:15.250+0000",
  "type": "item"
```
the reinstate operation will result in:
```json
  "inArchive": true,
  "discoverable": true,
  "withdrawn": false,
  "lastModified": "2018-05-17T16:53:15.250+0000",
  "type": "item"
```

To make an item private (or discoverable), `curl --data '[ { "op": "replace", "path": "/discoverable", "value": false}]' -H "Authorization: Bearer ..." -H "content-type: application/json" -X PATCH ${dspace7-url}/api/core/items/${item-uuid}`.  The discoverable operation also requires an Authorization header.


For example, starting with the following item data:
```json
  "inArchive": true,
  "discoverable": true,
  "withdrawn": false,
  "lastModified": "2018-05-17T16:53:15.250+0000",
  "type": "item"
```
the discoverable operation will result in:
```json
  "inArchive": true,
  "discoverable": false,
  "withdrawn": false,
  "lastModified": "2018-05-17T16:53:15.250+0000",
  "type": "item"
```
