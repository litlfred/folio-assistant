/**
 * The two documents the `discussion` process carries, as Zod.
 *
 * @module bootstrap-tools/schemas/discussion
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## These shapes describe `bootstrap`, and deliberately do not live in it
 *
 * `bootstrap/README.md` promises an Initiator that it needs **no harness,
 * no server, no tools and no work plan**, and that what it reads is "a file
 * you read, not something you run". Measured: that directory holds `.md`,
 * `.json` and `.bpmn` and **no executable code**. So its shapes cannot be Zod
 * *in it* — owner, 2026-09-20, *"the zod schema should by one special
 * exemption not be bootstrap, but bootstrap-tools"*, and *"bootstrap should
 * not know zod at all"*.
 *
 * `bootstrap/skills/discussion.*.schema.json` is GENERATED from here. The
 * `$id`s are unchanged and must stay so: they are a published contract, and
 * the filenames are cited from `discussion.bpmn`, `cat-harness/tools/index.ts`,
 * the generated skill docs and `.pot` catalogues in five languages.
 *
 * ## What Zod cannot carry across, and why it is handled rather than accepted
 *
 * **`.refine()` exports nothing to JSON Schema.** Measured with
 * `zod-to-json-schema`: no `allOf`, no `if`/`then`, no trace of the rule. The
 * output document has two conditionals that a consumer relies on, so they are
 * re-applied by the generator (`JSON_SCHEMA_CONDITIONALS`) rather than left to
 * vanish. The refinements below are kept ANYWAY, because they are what makes
 * the Zod type honest for anything validating in-process; the generator's
 * table is what makes the published document honest. Two forms of one rule is
 * a thing to be uneasy about, which is exactly why
 * `discussion.test.ts` asserts the generated schema and the Zod schema agree
 * on the same corpus of documents.
