/**
 * bootstrap's own terms, and the shape of the file that declares a Knowledge
 * Graph. Generated into `bootstrap/schemas/graph.schema.json`.
 *
 * @module schemas/graph
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## Why bootstrap defines its own terms (owner, 2026-09-23)
 *
 * *"bootstrap = self definitional. no semantic leakage, no graph leakage …
 * all terms have a schema in glossary."* Before this file, the words
 * `bootstrap/README.md` is built on (Actor, Role, Process, Skill) were
 * defined in `cat-harness/schemas/vocabulary.ts`, and their published
 * definitions linked to cat-harness pages. So bootstrap, the one layer that
 * must be readable with nothing else present, could not define the words it
 * uses. Now it does, here, and `vocabulary.ts` reads these definitions
 * rather than holding its own copies. That is the allowed direction: a
 * harness may read bootstrap, never the reverse.
 *
 * ## A Knowledge Graph has zero or more named Subgraphs
 *
 * Also the owner's words: *"a graph schema can contain zero or more named
 * dirs=subgraphs"*. {@link KnowledgeGraphDeclarationSchema} is the minimal
 * shape every `<name>.json` declaration shares: a name, and its Subgraphs
 * under `directories`. It passes through everything else, because a Harness
 * above bootstrap adds fields bootstrap has no opinion on. A test holds every
 * declaration in this repository to it, so the two cannot drift apart.
 *
 * ## Each definition is one or two plain sentences
 *
 * The reader is an agent or a person who has opened nothing else. Every term
 * used inside a definition is itself defined here, or is ordinary English.
 * No term names a particular Harness above bootstrap, or an outside standard
 * by an acronym it does not spell out.
