# AGENTS.md — bootstrap-tools

What this toolset *is* is [`README.md`](README.md). Three rules govern work here, and each guards a boundary that is easy to erase by accident.

## 1. Nothing you add here may make `bootstrap` need a tool

Bootstrap promises an agent that it needs nothing installed: *"a file you read, not something you run"*. So the direction is one-way: **bootstrap-tools reads and writes bootstrap; bootstrap never imports from here.** A change that would put an import, a dependency, a `package.json` or a build step into `bootstrap/` is the wrong change. The owner: *"bootstrap should not know zod at all."*

## 2. Nothing here may import above bootstrap

bootstrap-tools depends on bootstrap, on `zod`, on `liquidjs` (the README templates), on `@playwright/test` and `bpmn-js` (to draw a Process), and on the runtime, and on nothing else (owner, 2026-09-29). `bun run check:tools-closure` fails on any import that leaves this directory or names another package; tests may also use `bun:test` and `ajv`. When you need something from a harness, move the small piece down, or have the harness call this toolset instead.

The outside libraries this toolset imports are recorded, but not here. cat-harness-tools holds them as `software-library` nodes under `libraries/held/bootstrap-tools/`, keyed by `layer: "bootstrap-tools"`, because the kind is cat-harness's and this toolset may not name it (owner, 2026-10-30, #44). Do not add a `libraries/` here. After a dependency change, the next re-pin of this toolset in cat-harness-tools runs `libraries:derive`.

## 3. A generated schema is a published contract

The JSON Schemas in `bootstrap/schemas/` are generated from `schemas/*.ts` and published at their `$id`. Changing the Zod changes what a third party accepts. Two known traps:

- **`.refine()` exports nothing to JSON Schema.** A rule written only as a refinement vanishes from the published document. Add its JSON Schema form too (`JSON_SCHEMA_CONDITIONALS`), and a test case that fails without it.
- **`z.object()` is strict.** The exporter would add `additionalProperties: false`; the generator strips it. Adopting strictness is a decision, not a side effect.

A published node's identifier must be its file's path under the release address; `bun run check:node-iris` fails otherwise.

After a change here: `bun run bootstrap:schemas`, then `bun test bootstrap-tools`. The `--check` twins are in the gate set.

## Running a tool as a process step

Each script is a step an agent can perform in a process lane: the agent runs it, reads its output, and reports. Nothing here requires a CI service; a GitHub Actions workflow may be described but is not enabled unless the owner asks (owner, 2026-09-29: *"assume primarily agentic"*, and no paid runs without an explicit request).

Which lane runs what — the lanes are the roles of the hosting harness's `kg-separation.bpmn` while the pair is staged, and of the content repository's own review once it is not:

| step | command (from this directory) | lane | fails when |
|---|---|---|---|
| regenerate schemas and the schema page | `bun run schemas` | authoring agent | — (writes) |
| schemas are current | `bun run schemas:check` | build pipeline | a generated file differs from its Zod |
| every file's identifier is its path | `bun run check:node-iris` | build pipeline | an `$id`/`@id` under the release base names another path |
| literal release IRIs at the declared version | `bun run iri:sync:check` | build pipeline | a literal names another version |
| no outside concept in the schemas | `bun run check:concepts` | build pipeline | a forbidden word appears |
| imports stay inside the toolset | `bun run check:closure` | build pipeline | an import leaves or names a package not allowed |
| READMEs and diagrams are current | `bun run readmes:check`, `bun run render:check` | build pipeline | a generated region or picture is stale |
| named subgraphs frame the graph | `bun run subgraphs:check` | build pipeline | a subgraph file does not validate, a child has no file, a node cannot be placed, or a diagram is not a documented Process |
| unit tests | `bun test .` | build pipeline | any fails |
| status of a push to GitHub Pages, and its message | `bun run pages:status -- --root <instance> [--url <root>] [--sha <commit>]` | Site Publisher (`processes/render-kg-to-github-pages.bpmn`) | exit 1 not pushed, 3 could not determine |

The last row is a step of this toolset's own Process, not of the hosting harness's: `render-kg-to-github-pages.bpmn`, with its Skill and Roles here, renders a Knowledge Graph (or a list of its Subgraphs) to GitHub Pages at a publication root URL. A harness above may name it as one way of publishing; nothing here names that harness.

A step that fails is reported with its output and the command to reproduce it; the agent does not "fix" a check by editing what the check reads unless that is the change under review.

## CI — the README checks are enabled; the rest is described

Owner, 2026-10-01: *"each repo owns its README"* — no hosting harness regenerates or checks it any more, so each repository's own CI fails when its README is stale. Here that is `.github/workflows/check.yml`: this repository's READMEs, checked with bootstrap-tools standing alone, because their output must not depend on what sits beside them (a term outside bootstrap links to bootstrap's published schema page, never to a sibling path). bootstrap's READMEs and schemas are checked from here too, by `.github/workflows/check-bootstrap.yml`, with bootstrap checked out beside the tools: bootstrap carries no workflow, because one would name this toolset (owner, 2026-10-02). It runs on a schedule, by hand, and after each publish of bootstrap's site, never on a bootstrap PR.

The fuller check below is still only described. When the owner asks for it, this is the whole of it: one more job in `check-bootstrap.yml`, calling the tools at a pinned version. It is written here rather than committed so that nothing more runs, and nothing more is billed, until someone decides it should.

```yaml
# litlfred/bootstrap-tools — a further job for check-bootstrap.yml (NOT ENABLED)
on: [workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: { repository: litlfred/bootstrap, path: bootstrap }
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: { ref: v0.1.0, path: bootstrap-tools }
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
      - run: bun install --cwd bootstrap-tools
      - run: |
          cd bootstrap-tools
          bun run schemas:check && bun run check:node-iris && bun run iri:sync:check \
            && bun run check:concepts && bun run readmes:check && bun test .
```

The tools are checked out at a **tag**, never a branch: a content check that changes under the content without a commit to it cannot be reproduced. Rendering the diagrams needs a browser and is left to the agent's run, not this workflow, until someone asks.

No npm package is published either: `package.json` is `"private": true`. The parent consumes the tools by path while the pair is staged, and a published package is a decision for the first release (`kg-separation` stage 12).

## The skills this layer publishes

<!-- skills:index:begin -->

_3 skills in 1 directory, generated from each skill's front matter. `bun run cat readme:sync` rewrites this list and `readme:sync:check` fails when it is stale. Skills this repository inherits are listed by the repositories that publish them._

**`skills/`** (3)

| Skill | What it is for |
|---|---|
| [`bootstrap-contract-semver`](skills/bootstrap-contract-semver.md) | What MAJOR, MINOR and PATCH mean for bootstrap's PUBLISHED schemas and graph, and why the bump is computed from a diff of the generated documents rather than asserted. |
| [`github-pages`](skills/github-pages.md) | The contract GitHub Pages keeps as the host of a rendered Knowledge Graph: serve the gh-pages branch at the publication root URL, exactly as committed, and answer 404 for what is not there. |
| [`render-kg-to-github-pages`](skills/render-kg-to-github-pages.md) | Render a Knowledge Graph, or a list of its Subgraphs, to GitHub Pages at a publication root URL, and report the push: a status (pushed, not pushed, could not determine) and one message carrying the… |
