/**
 * Link every defined term in a piece of Markdown prose to its definition.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-29: *"terms in readme like Skills, Process, Role, etc should
 * be links in README.md s"*. A capitalized defined term is a link wherever it
 * appears in prose, not only at its first use, so a reader landing mid-page
 * can still reach the definition in one click.
 *
 * ## What is linked, and what is left alone
 *
 * - A term is matched by its spaced name (`Knowledge Graph`), singular or
 *   plural, as a whole, case-sensitive word; longer names first, so
 *   `Node Kind` is never also read as `Node`.
 * - Left alone: fenced code and inline code, headings, the text and target of
 *   an existing link, HTML tags, and **bold** spans — the bold names in a
 *   Role table (`**Knowledge Graph Data Store**`) are names of their own, and
 *   linking a word inside one would split it.
 *
 * Pure: text in, text out. Callers decide where each term's link goes,
 * because the right relative path depends on where the README is.
 *
 * @module content/pipeline/term-links
