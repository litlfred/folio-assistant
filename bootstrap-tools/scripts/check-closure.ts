/**
 * check-closure.ts — bootstrap-tools imports nothing but itself, `zod`,
 * `liquidjs`, `@playwright/test` and the runtime.
 *
 * ## Why this is a gate, not a convention
 *
 * bootstrap-tools exists to be released and run without anything above
 * bootstrap: its Zod is bootstrap's contract, and a bootstrap release must not
 * wait on a harness (owner, 2026-09-29, bean `xsqm`). Before it was re-created,
 * the same code reached 19 files / 11,577 lines of the harness above it through three
 * imports nobody had looked at (measured). A boundary nothing checks is the
 * boundary that erodes first: every gate in this repository that guarded a
 * boundary without failing on a planted violation turned out not to guard it
 * (`4j3h`, `q2wn`, `p11x`), so this one is tested with planted violations too.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * For every `.ts` file under `bootstrap-tools/`:
 * - a RELATIVE import must resolve to a file inside `bootstrap-tools/`;
 * - a BARE import must be `zod`, `liquidjs`, `@playwright/test`, a `node:`
 *   builtin, or — in a test file only — `bun:test` or `ajv`. `liquidjs` is the
 *   README writers' template engine and Playwright drives the Chromium that
 *   draws a Process (Phase 2 of bean `xsqm`: the owner ruled one copy of the
 *   writers, here, and allowed both as dependencies). bpmn-js is loaded into
 *   that browser as a file, never imported.
 *
 * Imports are read with comments and string literals of other statements
 * stripped, so a docblock that quotes an import is not one.
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run check:tools-closure
 * ```
 *
 * ## One walker: the transitive resolver the gate and a mount share
 *
 * {@link importClosure} is the walk: from a set of entry files, every module
 * they import, transitively, with each edge resolved or said not to be. This
 * gate is one caller (every file of the package, followed only inside it);
 * a remote mount that brings a chosen Tool is another (its definition and
 * implementation, followed across the mounted instances); the staging cone is
 * a third. Owner, 2026-10-24 (bean `mo75` G3,
 * https://github.com/litlfred/cat-harness-tools/issues/744): *one*
 * closure walker, refactored out of this gate, rather than a second one
 * written beside it — two walkers are two answers to "what does this code
 * load", and the one a gate does not exercise is the one that drifts.
 *
 * The walker reads through a {@link ClosureHost}, so a caller can walk a tree
 * it has not checked out (a remote mount reads the pin), and it never decides
 * what a BARE specifier is: `resolveBare` maps a package the caller holds to a
 * file, and anything it does not map is `external`, left to the package
 * manager. It judges nothing; the gate below and each other caller do.
 *
