/**
 * Publish bootstrap's files AS THEY SIT at its site address — every relative
 * link in them still resolves, because nothing moves.
 *
 * @module bootstrap-tools/scripts/publish-files
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-30 (bean `xsqm`, site publisher ruling A): "move it without
 * remark and let GitHub Pages render .md". bootstrap's own site serves only
 * what bootstrap-tools generates plus bootstrap's files; a `.md` is rendered
 * by Pages, not here, so this has no Markdown dependency. A harness that
 * hosts a copy of bootstrap on a site Pages does NOT render (cat-harness's)
 * renders the `.md` itself, after this — `cat-harness/scripts/publish-instance-files.ts`.
 *
 * NEVER OVERWRITES. A site build may already have written a file at the same
 * address (the graph's `.json` copy shares its name with `bootstrap.json`); the
 * file already there wins, and the one not published is reported in `skipped`
 * rather than dropped silently.
 *
 * Usage: bun run bootstrap-tools/scripts/publish-files.ts --root ./bootstrap --out ./_site/bootstrap
