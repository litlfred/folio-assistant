/**
 * A README for every declared directory, generated from the Knowledge Graph.
 *
 * @module bootstrap-tools/scripts/subgraph-readmes
 * @covers code
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-29: a large instance *"can't have all their files listed
 * directly, however they have declared subgraphs/dirs in which to naturally
 * link to sub-README generated documentation for that directory. make sure
 * sub-dir READMEs part of the KG itself"*; *"you should be able to extract
 * needed metadata info (e.g. titles, desc) from the KG itself. QA check when
 * not there"*; committed READMEs, with Liquid `{% include %}` allowed.
 *
 * ## Why this lives in bootstrap-tools, and what it does not know
 *
 * One copy of the README writers, in the tools repository (owner, 2026-09-29,
 * bean `xsqm`), which the harness that hosts bootstrap calls. It knows bootstrap's declaration
 * shape and nothing above it. So it takes its instances ALREADY RESOLVED
 * ({@link InstanceInput}): a harness whose declarations carry Extensions —
 * a directory scoped to the repository, one allowed to be absent — resolves
 * those itself and hands the result to {@link plan}. Run standalone, this
 * resolves with bootstrap's plain rule (every path relative to its
 * declaration), which is {@link instancesIn} — and it writes only the
 * content graphs this toolset declares it `supports`, at a supported major.
 * A graph above bootstrap may carry Extensions this reader does not know;
 * writing its READMEs anyway would be guessing, so it is that harness's
 * call (measured: over this repository, 15 of 85 READMEs came out different
 * without the harness's `scope`).
 *
 * ## What it writes, and where it will not
 *
 * For each declared directory, `<directory>/README.md`, and only between
 * `<!-- kg:subgraph:begin -->` and `<!-- kg:subgraph:end -->`:
 *
 * - no README → one is created holding just that region;
 * - a README carrying the markers → the region is replaced;
 * - a README without them → **left alone**, and reported. Somebody wrote it,
 *   and the tool owns markers, never the file.
 *
 * A README whose every line outside the region is this tool's or another
 * generator's — a page wholly generated — also opens with YAML front matter
 * holding one `generated:` key (owner, 2026-10-16, decision 4a), so the page
 * declares itself generated where a checker looks for that. A partly authored
 * README never gets it, and a README that already opens with front matter
 * keeps that block untouched rather than gaining a second.
 *
 * ## Where the words come from
 *
 * The heading is the directory's declared `title`, the paragraph its declared
 * `description`, the kinds its `graphTypologies`; each file row is described from
 * the file itself and "used by" only where a diagram records it (the helpers
 * of the `kg:files` README section). The layout is Liquid, in
 * `templates/readme/` beside this file; templates may `{% include %}` each
 * other, Jekyll style, and read any declared field through `kg`.
 *
 * ## The governing PROCESS, where the caller resolved one
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-29: *"show highlevel (sub)process bpmn on the uploads
 * page."* A directory may name a BPMN process that governs it; the diagram is
 * then drawn on its README, with its `.bpmn` source and a row per subprocess.
 * The template half is `templates/readme/process.liquid`, included only when
 * the caller supplies a {@link ProcessView}.
 *
 * **Resolved by the caller, like every other Extension here.** A process name
 * is declared in a field this reader does not know (in one harness,
 * `coverage.process`), and a diagram has a home the calling harness's
 * declaration knows; this writer defines only the SHAPE it renders. So a
 * harness resolves the name to a diagram and hands over the view.
 *
 * DECLARED, never matched out of the diagram's prose. `document-ingestion`
 * opens on an event named "A file lands in uploads/", which is exactly the
 * inference not to make: an event's name is editorial text, and rewording it
 * would unlink the page with nothing able to tell that from a directory that
 * never had a process.
 *
 * A directory the caller resolved nothing for gets no section and is no
 * finding. A view whose `bpmn` is empty keeps the section, says *could not
 * determine*, and IS a finding — a printed absence and a real absence must
 * not look alike.
 *
 * ## A missing fact is a finding, never a blank
 *
 * {@link Plan.findings} records every directory with no `title` or no
 * `description`, every declared directory absent from disk (unless the caller
 * said it may be), and every README left untouched for lack of markers. The
 * caller decides where findings are recorded; standalone, they are printed.
 *
 * Usage: `bun run bootstrap-tools/scripts/subgraph-readmes.ts [--repo <dir>] [--check]`

   * The caller resolves it rather than this writer, and that is the point.
   * `declarationFileIn` recognises a declaration by `name` matching its own
   * basename, which is a deliberate discriminator: `bootstrap-tools/` holds
   * BOTH `package.json` and `bootstrap-tools.json`, and both satisfy
   * `KnowledgeGraphDeclarationSchema` — npm's `package.json` has a `name` and
   * supports `directories` — so a "whatever validates" rule would make that
   * function throw on its own repository. Measured 2026-10-01.
   *
   * Some declarations legitimately do NOT match that rule. `beans/beans.json`
   * carries `name: "folio-assistant"`, because there `name` answers *whose*
   * work plan this is, and the filename comes from the graph typology — the
   * owner's rule, 2026-09-20: each type declares its own filename, so that
   * relocating `beans/` to `work/` renames nothing inside it. Both
   * conventions are right for what they guard, and reconciling them is a
   * separate question from naming a row in a table.
   *
   * So the harness, which knows its own kinds, hands the answer down. A file
   * COUNT drifts on every commit that adds a file — it is why one line of
   * `beans/README.md` conflicted three times in one day — while a declared
   * description changes only when the declaration does.
