/**
 * How to enumerate a corpus you will never hold, and how to ask it for a subset.
 *
 * @module large-datasets/schemas/source-descriptor
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## The question `materialize-remote` does not answer
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20, generalising away from IRIS:
 *
 * > *"someone may want to pull in a few nodes of a large data set, IRIS,
 * > CODATA, cosomological, weather, whatever, need to know sources and how to
 * > get subsets of data, not acquire all. IRIS is one concrete example.
 * > lean-mathlib is another large corpus example. genealize processes."*
 *
 * `materialize-remote` answers *"may we take this, and what does holding it
 * cost"*. It does not answer the question **before** that one: how do you
 * enumerate a corpus, and how do you ask it for a part? Every source answers
 * differently and none of it is guessable, so without a descriptor an agent
 * asked for "the WPRO style guides" must be told the API by a human every
 * single time, and that answer is written down nowhere.
 *
 * Why it matters here in numbers: IRIS is **1,057,223 files and 361.55 GB**
 * across 8 communities, measured from its own storage report on 2026-09-20.
 * Acquiring all of it is not a bigger version of acquiring three items; it is a
 * different activity with different everything.
 *
 * ## Two worked descriptors, and the second is what makes it an abstraction
 *
 * One example is a special case with an interface drawn round it. The second
 * has to be genuinely unlike the first or the interface is a disguise, so the
 * pair here is deliberately far apart:
 *
 * | | WHO IRIS | Lean mathlib |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | what a node is | a repository item | a declaration |
 * | enumerate by | paged REST over communities and collections | the module graph |
 * | subset by | collection, handle, MeSH subject | the import closure of a declaration |
 * | identifiers | UUID, Handle, govdoc — three systems | fully-qualified name — one |
 * | is a subset self-contained? | **yes** — an item stands alone | **no** — a declaration needs its closure |
 *
 * That last row is the one a single-example design would have missed entirely,
 * and it is why {@link SubsetStrategy} carries `closure`. Asking mathlib for
 * "this declaration" and getting only that declaration produces something that
 * does not compile — a subset that is not a usable corpus.
 *
 * ## Cost is declared, because "just enumerate it" is a decision
 *
 * Enumerating 1,057,223 items over a paged REST API at 100 per page is **10,572
 * requests**. That is not free, it is rate-limited, and it may be refused. So a
 * descriptor states what enumeration COSTS, and {@link enumerationCost} exists
 * so the size gate can be answered before anything is fetched rather than
 * after.
 *
 * ## Characterising a source is what decides how it may be REFERENCED
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20:
 *
 * > *"should be a part of 'ingesting new data source' process, is it remote,
 * > large, cotunally changin, etc... all impact how referneced. need to archive
 * > imperative?"*
 *
 * Yes — and the imperative falls out of the characterisation rather than being
 * a separate judgement. **A reference is a promise that the thing will still be
 * there, and will still be the same thing.** Three properties decide whether
 * that promise can be kept:
 *
 * | remote | large | volatile | how it may be referenced |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | no | – | – | hold it; the question does not arise |
 * | yes | no | no | materialise working; a bare reference is honest |
 * | yes | yes | no | reference the whole, materialise a subset |
 * | yes | – | **yes** | **archive, or do not cite it** |
 *
 * The last row is the finding. A reference to a moving target resolves LATER to
 * something that is not what was cited, and nothing in the citation records
 * that it changed — which is strictly worse than a broken link, because a
 * broken link announces itself and a silently-changed one does not. So
 * {@link archivalImperative} returns `required` on a volatile source, and the
 * `sourceLoss` gate can then only be discharged by an archival copy.
 *
 * ## Delegating search is a fallback, and "if possible" is load-bearing
 *
 * The owner's preferred default for search over what is NOT materialised is to
 * send the reader to the source itself — it is always current, complete, and
 * costs nothing to keep fresh. But it is only available when the source is
 * reachable, has a search of its own, and is stable enough that a link composed
 * today still means the same thing. {@link canDelegateSearch} answers that from
 * the characterisation instead of leaving it to be assumed, because a
 * delegation to an unreachable source is a dead end presented as an answer.
