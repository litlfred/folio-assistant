`pages-publish-health` (bean `qj9a`) counts instruments for observing the
published site. The count is **0**, so it reports a `major` finding whose action
is this bean. This is that probe, specified rather than built, because it cannot
be built here.

## Why it cannot be written or tested from an agent's container

Measured 2026-09-25 and 2026-09-26, every route refused:

| route | result |
|---|---|
| `GET https://litlfred.github.io/folio-assistant/` | `connect_rejected` — egress proxy, organization policy |
| the same for a `STAGING/<slug>/` page | `connect_rejected` |
| `GET /repos/:o/:r/pages` | every field `null` |
| `GET /repos/:o/:r/pages/builds` | *"Access to this GitHub API path is not permitted through this proxy"* |
| `actions/workflows/pages-build-deployment/runs` | `total_count` absent |

So a probe written locally cannot be exercised even once, and a probe that
reaches the network at sweep time would report `unknown` — which
[`qj9a`](folio-assistant-qj9a--staging-size-the-measurement-is-right-and-the-seve.md)
establishes takes the WHOLE health report to `unknown`, exits 2 and leaves the
tracking issue untouched. `health-check.yml`'s own comment: *"the whole verdict
goes to `unknown` — correctly, and uselessly."*

**That constraint shapes the design and is the reason this is a bean rather than
a patch.**

## What it has to do

1. **Run in CI**, in a job with ordinary egress — `health-check.yml` already runs
   daily and already fetches `gh-pages`, so it is the obvious host.
2. **Fetch the published site** and record, per URL: HTTP status, bytes served,
   and whether the body is the expected page rather than Pages' own 404.
3. **Record the observation as committed evidence**, not as a live call the sweep
   depends on. The check then reads the recorded observation and counts as its
   instrument — which keeps `pages-publish-health` offline and deterministic,
   the property `bean-quiet-claims` has for the same reason (`bun run cat health`
   must not need a token or a reachable API to say anything).
4. **Carry its own staleness**, because a recorded observation is a measurement
   with a date. An observation older than N is not an observation — same rule
   `check:ci-health` applies to a red that has not re-run in a week.

## The question it exists to settle

**Is GitHub's documented 1 GB Pages limit enforced at all for branch-based
sites?** Measured: the served tree crossed 1 GB on 2026-09-23 and was 2.67 GB on
2026-09-25, with every deploy succeeding throughout. So it is not a hard refusal
on push. Whether it degrades, truncates, or is simply unenforced is unknown, and
the answer changes what the thresholds MEAN:

- **enforced somehow** → 500 MB is a safety margin and the owner's number is a
  cliff-avoidance measure
- **not enforced** → 500 MB is a repository-hygiene policy, and saying so plainly
  is more honest than implying a cliff

Neither is asserted here. This is the one fact a probe buys that no amount of
reasoning does.

## What it must NOT become

**Not a gate.** `schema:viz:check` is exempt from gating for a reason that
applies with more force here: a check depending on an external service reddens
when that service hiccups rather than when this author forgot something. The
probe records; a person reads.

**Not a licence to delete.** Even a probe returning HTTP 500 would not authorise
removing a preview — `deletion-requires-confirmation`, and every remedy on this
check names a person.

## Done when

- [x] A CI job fetches the published site and commits the observation with its
      timestamp
- [x] `pages-publish-health` reads that observation, counts it as its instrument,
      and stays offline — no network at sweep time
- [x] A stale observation is distinguished from a fresh one, with the horizon's
      basis recorded
- [x] The enforcement question above is answered from evidence, and
      `STAGING_WARN_BYTES`' basis says which of the two readings is true
- [x] It is NOT wired into `gates`, and the exemption states why

## Progress 2026-10-12 09:05 UTC (lane A)
Owner ruling 2026-10-11: **add-only publish**. `publishQa` never writes into an existing entry, and the gates job writes `main/<sha>` first, so the writer could not land a file there.
- litlfred/cat-harness-tools#140: `qa:publish --add` writes into the existing entry. It never changes a path from the first write, can replace a path an earlier add wrote (so the observation refreshes daily), creates nothing when there is no entry, and resolves skipped refs. qa-store suite 37/0.
- litlfred/folio-assistant#2538: the health-check.yml writer. It observes the root and every gh-pages directory index, using a 404 control, and runs `qa:publish --add`. It refuses to publish without #140 in the tools pin.
Closes when both are merged, the pin includes #140, and one daily run reads `pages-publish-health` as known.

_2026-10-16T06:30:00Z_ — Store reconciliation: status `todo` → `in-progress` (Owner ruling 2026-10-16, item 9: "based on semantic content"; the copies said folio-assistant: todo, cat-harness: todo, cat-harness-tools: in-progress). Evidence: owner ruling 2026-10-11 (option 1, qa-reports) and lane progress: cat-harness#141 merged, cat-harness-tools#117/#140 and folio-assistant#2538 in flight. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01Pc8vSeXCwp5Ckvmz56cMDs.

_2026-10-20T15:40:00Z_ — **The close condition cannot be met yet, because the watchdog never finishes.** Code side: #140 and #2538 are merged (#2538 through #2529, merged 2026-10-15), and the pin carries #140. But every `health-check.yml` run on record, run 16 (2026-10-05) through run 31 (2026-10-20), ended `cancelled`. In run 31 the **Checkout** step alone took 06:59:39–07:14:37, against the job's `timeout-minutes: 15`, so the pages-serving step never ran. The checkout is `fetch-depth: 0`, which fetches every branch, state branches and `gh-pages` included. It is set that way on purpose, for `repository-size`. Fixing this means choosing what that check measures, which is put to the owner. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01JkK6uP3iU2etyMbrw7v3cu.

_2026-10-21T18:18:00Z_ — **Completed.** `litlfred/folio-assistant#2610` (`3d586f5794`) merged the owner's 2026-10-20 choice (option 1: shallow checkout + `git fetch --unshallow --no-tags origin "+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main"`, `timeout-minutes: 30`). In `health-check.yml` run `39650717679` on `main/3d586f5794c6596525a0a935f51ccd054ba5df39`, `Observe the published site (pages-serving)` succeeded and published `main/3d586f5794c6596525a0a935f51ccd054ba5df39/health/pages-serving.json` to `cat/cat-harness/qa-reports` (`691ae7a593`): **36 of 36** published URLs on `https://litlfred.github.io/folio-assistant/` returned HTTP 200 and `expectedPage: true` (0 failing), and `bun run cat health` now reads `pages-publish-health` as `ok` (0 findings) and `verdict: "findings"` (no longer `unknown`), pushed to `cat/cat-harness/health`. `STAGING_WARN_BYTES`' basis in `cat-harness-tools/test/health/checks.ts` states that it is a repository-hygiene budget (`3 GB`, enforced by `staging-rotate.ts`) rather than a GitHub cliff. Note for follow-up: `git fetch --filter=blob:none` in the `pages-serving` step sets `remote.origin.partialclonefilter = blob:none` in `.git/config`, which makes `git ls-tree -r -l` in `probeStaging` / `probeSpecialBranches` lazy-fetch blobs one-by-one unless `--filter=blob:none` is dropped or unset before `Run the health checks`.
