Measured 2026-09-26.

## What happened

- At 15:26Z dependabot commented on #908: *"Dependabot could not run Bun to update your dependencies due to a configuration error."* That came about 13 minutes after #1407 put the same bumps on main.
- **This is not evidence of a defect in our config.** The same message appeared on 25–26 Sep across many unrelated repos with different setups. Examples: [bun-chat#19](https://github.com/johannesjahn/bun-chat/pull/19) on Sep 25, and [lazyit#1303](https://github.com/joacominatel/lazyit/pull/1303), [firetg#7](https://github.com/Mergemat/firetg/pull/7) and [hermes#31](https://github.com/mdhishaamakhtar/hermes/pull/31). None has a stated cause.
- **The known lockfile causes do not apply.** Other repos fail on `lockfileVersion: 2`, which bun 1.4 writes (e.g. [lsimons/ai-training#512](https://github.com/lsimons/ai-training/issues/512)). Ours is `lockfileVersion: 1`, `configVersion: 1`, bun 1.3.11. [dependabot-core#13623](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/13623), which strips `configVersion`, is closed.
- `bunfig.toml` only sets a test preload.

## The gap that IS ours

`.github/dependabot.yml` declares `package-ecosystem: npm` for the five bun-installed directories. That is why #908 changed `package.json` and never `bun.lock`, so under `--frozen-lockfile` its PRs could never go green. The file's own comment predicted this. Dependabot has a dedicated `bun` ecosystem. Whether switching fixes the lockfile half cannot be verified until a weekly run, and the Sep 2026 failures affect the bun ecosystem too.

## Done when

- [ ] one weekly dependabot run after the upstream failure clears, observed: does it open PRs, and do they touch bun.lock?
- [ ] if not: try `package-ecosystem: bun` in one PR, verified by the next weekly run, not asserted
- [x] the header comment in `.github/dependabot.yml` updated with the answer

## Note (2026-10-10, drain ml9h)

Lane B scrapped the cat-harness-tools copy: the subject is folio-assistant's own dependabot.yml, so THIS copy is the owning one and stays open.

## 2026-10-20 — the config named directories this repository no longer holds (drain coordinator, session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BiusQ9uAZiHP6TUhfwZ2h6)

Since the separation the index tracks one `package.json` (the root's, zero dependencies, workspaces = mounts). Four npm directories and the pip `/cat-harness-tools/python` named mounts, so Dependabot scanned nothing there. litlfred/folio-assistant#2609 keeps only `/.github/scripts` pip and Actions; litlfred/cat-harness-tools#469 gives tools its own pip `/python` + Actions. npm/bun for instances is deferred until `@litlfred/*` resolve from a reachable registry. Box 1 (observe a weekly run) still open.

## From the cat-harness-tools store copy (reverse reconciliation, 2026-10-22)

_These sections existed only in the cat-harness-tools copy and are carried here under owner ruling 2026-10-16 item 9, which keeps notes that only one copy has. They are historical and do not change this bean's status. The forward direction is litlfred/cat-harness-tools#558. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BiusQ9uAZiHP6TUhfwZ2h6._

### Reasons for Scrapping

Scrapped 2026-10-10 in the cat-harness-tools store (lane B drain): the subject is not in this repository. The bean is about folio-assistant's `.github/dependabot.yml` (its npm-vs-bun ecosystem choice), and every remaining done-when is an observation of that repository's weekly Dependabot run. cat-harness-tools has no `dependabot.yml`. The copy of this bean in the folio-assistant store (`cat/cat-harness/beans`) is the live one; it should stay open there and not be closed as a mirror.

_2026-10-16T06:30:00Z_ — Store reconciliation: status `scrapped` → `todo` (Owner ruling 2026-10-16, item 9: "based on semantic content"; the copies said folio-assistant: todo, cat-harness: scrapped, cat-harness-tools: scrapped). Evidence: the scrap in the ch/cht copies was store placement only ("the subject is not in this repository"); no done-when was met, and the folio-assistant copy records that it is the owning one and stays open. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01Pc8vSeXCwp5Ckvmz56cMDs.

## Closed 2026-10-24 — the subject left this repository (https://claude.ai/code/session_01WJw1NBGSTLWvBnyQzJHXjx)

Measured on folio-assistant `main` a540e5e:
- `.github/dependabot.yml` declares only `pip` (`/.github/scripts`) and `github-actions`. There is no `npm` or `bun` entry, since litlfred/folio-assistant#2609.
- The root `package.json` has no `dependencies` or `devDependencies`. Its `workspaces` name mounts, not committed directories.
- The file's header now carries the answer (box 3): "The bun question … is answered in a repository whose `package.json` has dependencies, not in one whose root has none."

Boxes 1 and 2 observe a weekly Dependabot run on bun manifests, and this repository has none left to run on, so they cannot be met here. They are not ticked. **The bun question itself is unowned.** None of the instance repositories declares an npm or bun Dependabot entry today (cat-harness-tools has pip and Actions, per #469). Whichever adds one first inherits it.
