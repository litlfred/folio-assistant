An IG staged as its own just-the-docs site (`/<instance>/ig/`) wears the
palette of the **one `webpage` theme its instance declares**, or inherits
along its `needs`. Nothing new is authored for the IG: the theme already
exists as data, and this is how it reaches the site.

## The path, end to end

1. **Declared** — the instance's `themes/themes.ts` exports `INSTANCE_THEMES`,
   one of which has `kind: "webpage"` and a `palette` of four roles
   (`surface`, `ink`, `edge`, `accent`). Declaring a theme is
   [`theme-declaration`](../../../cat-harness/skills/ui/theming/theme-declaration.md)'s
   subject, not this skill's.
2. **Resolved** — `stage-ig-sites.ts` `webpagePalette(repoRoot, instance)`
   reads it through `instanceThemes` (`cat-harness/schemas/theme-by-ref.ts`),
   keyed on the instance's **declared name**. An instance that declares no
   `webpage` theme inherits the nearest one along its `needs` chain,
   breadth-first, and the stage log says which instance it came from.
3. **Rendered** — `build-ig-site.ts` `colourScheme(palette)` writes
   `_sass/color_schemes/ig.scss` and sets `color_scheme: ig`. just-the-docs'
   own colour-scheme mechanism does the rest, so the IG keeps the theme's
   machinery unchanged and only its colours move. The sidebar takes `accent`;
   its text colour is chosen by contrast, and a pairing under WCAG AA is
   reported (`CONTRAST:` in the stage log), never hidden.

## What is refused, and what is said

| case | outcome |
|---|---|
| no `webpage` theme, own or along `needs` | built on just-the-docs' default light scheme, and the stage log **says** `colour scheme: NONE`, with each instance's reason (`declares themes, none of kind webpage`) |
| **two or more** `webpage` themes in one instance, or at the same distance along `needs` | **refused** — nothing says which one dresses the IG |
| a palette pairing below AA | built, and reported under `CONTRAST:` |

## Three theme paths — do not conflate them

| path | surface | data | code |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IG site palette** (this skill) | the standalone IG site, `/<instance>/ig/` | the `webpage` theme's palette | `stage-ig-sites.ts` → `build-ig-site.ts` `colourScheme` |
| **docs-page theme** | the instance's composed docs pages, `/<instance>/…` | the same theme, as CSS variables | `gen-themes-css.ts` → `_data/instance-themes.json` → `head_custom.html` |
| **IG chrome** | "fixture" pages that mirror the Publisher's template | the template chain's tokens and rules (`chrome.json`) | `schemas/ig-chrome.ts`, `ingest-ig-chrome.ts` |

The first two read **one** declaration, so an IG's site and its docs pages
cannot disagree on colour. The chrome is a different model — the Publisher
template's own CSS, ingested with its conflicts — and is not a palette.

## Verify on the built CSS, not on a log line

A staged site's theme is checked by finding the palette's hex values (here
an `accent` of `<hex>`) in the built stylesheet:

```sh
git show <gh-pages>:STAGING/<slug>/<ig>/ig/assets/css/just-the-docs-default.css \
  | grep -c '<hex>'
```

**Calling `stageIgSite` directly with no `palette` option prints `colour
scheme: NONE`** — true for that call, not for the instance. Do not read it as
a missing theme. Stage through `stage-ig-sites.ts` (or pass
`webpagePalette(...).palette`), and judge the result by the built CSS.

## Do not

- Author a second palette for the IG. One declaration, read by both paths
  above; a copy would be a second answer free to drift.
- Touch the theme's machinery. just-the-docs' layout, nav and components stay
  as they are; only the colour scheme is the instance's.
- Put a logo on it. Colour carries identity; the wordmark is set in type.
