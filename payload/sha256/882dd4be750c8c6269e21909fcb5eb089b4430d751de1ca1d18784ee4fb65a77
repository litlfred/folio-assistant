Split from 52dz (2026-09-24). 52dz's owner decisions moved section-title-audit into folio_init templates, but witness-pipeline.yml was not part of that decision and still sits in .github/workflows with ZERO runs all time (measured 2026-09-20), so check:ci-health cannot see it by construction.

## Done when
- [x] measured: does it run against the platform at all, or only a folio's computations? (measured 2026-10-05 below: invokes `python3 folio-assistant/computations/<script>`, which exists only in a folio checkout such as `qou`, never on the platform)
- [x] owner: keep here, move to folio_init templates (paper/), or retire to fsh-guts/ — retire (2026-10-20)


## Measured 2026-10-05 (first checkbox)
It CANNOT run against the platform. Every step invokes `python3 folio-assistant/computations/<script>`, i.e. a folio checkout with the platform symlinked beside it. On platform main, `git ls-tree -r origin/main` holds **0** files under `folio-assistant/computations/` and 0 matches for `hyperbolic_volumes.py` or `codata_masses.py` anywhere. Both scripts exist only in qou, at `computations/`. So its zero runs are not a billing artefact: dispatched here, it would fail at the first script.

Relevant to the owner question: qou now has an executable replacement for the refresh half. litlfred/qou#7514 adds `processes/content/witness-refresh.bpmn` (plan → parity → owner approval → run → gates → commit) and a `witness-refresh-plan` Tool, with the per-producer Tools generated from the block manifests (205). That points toward 'move to folio_init templates or retire', not 'keep here'. This is the agent's reading; the decision is the owner's, and the second checkbox stays open.

## Note (2026-10-10, drain ml9h)

Lane B scrapped the cat-harness-tools copy because the subject lives in folio-assistant / cat-harness; THIS copy is the owning one and stays open.

## OWNER, 2026-10-20 (session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BiusQ9uAZiHP6TUhfwZ2h6)

Chose **retire to fsh-guts/** ("Retire to fsh-guts (Recommended)"; the question stated it cannot run on the platform and qou's witness-refresh BPMN replaces the refresh half).

## 2026-10-20 — retired (pending merge of litlfred/folio-assistant#2609)

Removed from `.github/workflows/`; kept verbatim on the `fsh-guts` state branch at `retired/workflows/witness-pipeline.yml` with the note `retired/witness-pipeline.md`. Follow-up left open on purpose: `build-clarabel-mpfr.yml` existed only to feed this pipeline — its header now says so; whether its weekly build still earns its keep is a separate call. Three comments in cat-harness-tools still name this workflow as a caller.

## 2026-10-21 — retirement backed out on #2609 (`b6ddbca39f`); needs paired cat-harness-tools change

Commit `b6ddbca39f` in `#2609` restored `.github/workflows/witness-pipeline.yml` before merge because removing it alone causes `cat-harness-tools/scripts/check-workflow-paths.ts` (`FOLIO_PATHS` entries for `trivial-skeleton-audit.ts` and `codemod-leanval.ts`) to fail on 0 matching invocations. Retiring `witness-pipeline.yml` requires removing those two `FOLIO_PATHS` entries in `cat-harness-tools` and re-pinning `cat-harness-tools` in the same PR.

## 2026-10-22 — paired change opened

The tools half is litlfred/cat-harness-tools#546 (head `adcc95f`). It removes the 2 `FOLIO_PATHS` entries and the 3 `gates.ts` step exemptions, and puts 3 comments in the past tense. The index half (delete `.github/workflows/witness-pipeline.yml`, pin tools to `adcc95f`) is handed to lane C, to be cut from a current index in an owner window. The order is the one cat-harness#409 used: the index lands first, then #546 is re-run and merged with a merge commit, then the index is re-pinned to that merge.

## 2026-10-22 — done

Index half: litlfred/folio-assistant#2619 (workflow deleted, tools pinned d753967). Tools half: litlfred/cat-harness-tools#546, merged as `00527df`. It removes the 2 `FOLIO_PATHS` entries and 5 `gates.ts` step exemptions (trivial-skeleton-audit, conditional-class-banner-audit, codemod-leanval, audit-wiring, section-story-audit) that matched only this workflow, and adds corpus budgets for two slow tests. The index re-pin to `00527df` rides lane C's follow-up. Still open, as noted above: `build-clarabel-mpfr.yml`, which only fed this workflow.

## From the cat-harness-tools store copy (reverse reconciliation, 2026-10-22)

_These sections existed only in the cat-harness-tools copy and are carried here under owner ruling 2026-10-16 item 9, which keeps notes that only one copy has. They are historical and do not change this bean's status. The forward direction is litlfred/cat-harness-tools#558. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BiusQ9uAZiHP6TUhfwZ2h6._

### Reasons for Scrapping

Scrapped 2026-10-10 in the cat-harness-tools store (lane B drain): **the subject is not in this repository.** It asks whether folio-assistant's `.github/workflows/witness-pipeline.yml` should be kept, templated or retired, and the remaining box is an owner decision about that repository. The copy in the `cat/cat-harness/beans` store (litlfred/folio-assistant) is the live one. Keep it open there.

_2026-10-16T06:30:00Z_ — Store reconciliation: status `scrapped` → `todo` (Owner ruling 2026-10-16, item 9: "based on semantic content"; the copies said folio-assistant: todo, cat-harness: scrapped, cat-harness-tools: scrapped). Evidence: same as 197s: scrapped only as "not in this repository"; the witness-pipeline keep/template/retire decision is still the owner's. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01Pc8vSeXCwp5Ckvmz56cMDs.

_2026-10-23T08:00:00Z_ — Follow-up `build-clarabel-mpfr.yml` noted above is also resolved: moved to `folio-assistant-sci` as a reusable workflow in `litlfred/folio-assistant-sci#49` (`31d8cdf761`) and removed from `litlfred/folio-assistant` in `#2625` (`0f8d6d1f67`).
