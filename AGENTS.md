# AGENTS.md — folio-assistant

Cross-repository agent skills framework (unified skill management, RBAC, capability
detection). This file is the **agent-generic** source of truth, read natively by
Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cursor, Copilot, and others. Tool-specific
files (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`) should be thin stubs that point here.

## Commands

```sh
bun install                 # install deps
bun run src/index.ts --http # run the assistant (HTTP);  --stdio for stdio MCP
bun test                    # unit tests
bunx playwright test        # e2e tests   (npm script: test:e2e)
eslint .                    # lint
bun run src/index.ts --check-deps   # probe environment capabilities
```

## Work-plan & todos — use `beans`

`beans` ([hmans/beans](https://github.com/hmans/beans)) is the **single todo
mechanism** for agent work — both session-local and cross-session/cross-agent
coordinated work. Do **not** stand up a separate todo store (no API route,
dashboard, or `todos/*.json` work-plan); beans is it.

```sh
scripts/install-beans.sh                 # install the CLI if missing
beans prime                              # emit work-plan priming for agents
beans list                               # current open items
beans create "<title>"                   # open a work-plan item
beans <id> --status in-progress          # claim an item (durable, visible to siblings)
```

- **Session todos:** track anything you want to persist as beans, not in your
  agent's ephemeral in-memory todo list — `.beans/` is committed, so the plan
  survives a resume in a fresh container.
- **Cross-session / cross-agent todos:** the same committed `.beans/` store is the
  shared work-plan. **Claim before you work** (set `in-progress` + note your
  branch) so two sessions don't pick the same item; never resolve or delete a
  sibling's bean.
- **`beans ≠ sidecars`:** never `beans create` bulk machine-generated queues (QA
  `*.qa.json`, witness `*.witness.json`, watcher queues) — keep those as bulk JSON.
- **Move wiring and script together:** when relocating a hook-backed script or a
  queue, repoint every reference (docs, hooks, readers) in the same change.

Full discipline: `.claude/skills/local/todo-manager.md` and
`.claude/skills/local/bean-coordination.md`.

> Not to be confused with the content-review **feedback** workflow (the
> `todo-review` skill over `feedback/<paper>/*.ts`) — that is a separate domain
> feature, not the agent work-plan.

## At session start

Surface the work-plan before starting: run `beans prime` (and `beans list`), or
`scripts/session-start-coord-sweep.sh` for the CLI-independent surface (current
bean list parsed from `.beans/`, plus how far the default branch has moved and
recent sibling `claude/*` branch activity). Heavy triage of new commits belongs in
a background subagent, not the foreground.

- Skills live under `skills/` (packages) and `.claude/skills/` (local + capabilities).
