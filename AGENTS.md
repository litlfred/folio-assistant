# AGENTS.md — folio-assistant

Cross-repository agent skills framework (unified skill management, RBAC, capability
detection). This file is the **agent-generic** source of truth, read natively by
Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cursor, Copilot, and others. Tool-specific
files (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`) should be thin stubs that point here.

## Commands

```sh
bun install                 # install deps
bun run src/index.ts --http # run the assistant (HTTP);  --stdio for stdio MCP
bun test                    # unit tests
bunx playwright test        # e2e tests   (npm script: test:e2e)
eslint .                    # lint
bun run src/index.ts --check-deps   # probe environment capabilities
```

## Work-plan & todos — use `beans`

`beans` ([hmans/beans](https://github.com/hmans/beans)) is the **single todo
mechanism** for agent work — both session-local and cross-session/cross-agent
coordinated work. Do **not** stand up a separate todo store (no API route,
dashboard, or `todos/*.json` work-plan); beans is it.

```sh
scripts/install-beans.sh                 # install the CLI if missing
beans prime                              # emit work-plan priming for agents
beans list                               # current open items
beans create "<title>"                   # open a work-plan item
beans <id> --status in-progress          # claim an item (durable, visible to siblings)
```

- **Session todos:** track anything you want to persist as beans, not in your
  agent's ephemeral in-memory todo list — `.beans/` is committed, so the plan
  survives a resume in a fresh container.
- **Cross-session / cross-agent todos:** the same committed `.beans/` store is the
  shared work-plan. **Claim before you work** (set `in-progress` + note your
  branch) so two sessions don't pick the same item; never resolve or delete a
  sibling's bean.
- **`beans ≠ sidecars`:** never `beans create` bulk machine-generated queues (QA
  `*.qa.json`, witness `*.witness.json`, watcher queues) — keep those as bulk JSON.
- **Move wiring and script together:** when relocating a hook-backed script or a
  queue, repoint every reference (docs, hooks, readers) in the same change.

Full discipline: `.claude/skills/local/todo-manager.md` and
`.claude/skills/local/bean-coordination.md`.

> Not to be confused with the content-review **feedback** workflow (the
> `todo-review` skill over `feedback/<paper>/*.ts`) — that is a separate domain
> feature, not the agent work-plan.

## New here? Read the onboarding guide

minutes, how to find the right skill, the content-object model, the two
dependency relations, QA sidecars/axes, and where to look things up.

## At session start

Surface the work-plan before starting: run `beans prime` (and `beans list`), or
`scripts/session-start-coord-sweep.sh` for the CLI-independent surface (current
bean list parsed from `.beans/`, plus how far the default branch has moved and
recent sibling `claude/*` branch activity). Heavy triage of new commits belongs in
a background subagent, not the foreground.

## More

- **`uses[]` is the EDITORIAL relation** — what a *reader* must have read to
  follow a block. Agent/human maintained, part of the authored content.
  It is **not** the formal dependency graph; that is machine-derived from
  `lean.ref`. The two diverge legitimately in both directions (a proof invokes
  `simp` lemmas nobody reads about; a theorem is motivated by an example it
  never cites). **Never populate `uses[]` from Lean** — it destroys the signal
  every ordering metric is computed from. For impact questions ("what breaks if
  this changes?") use the union via `content/pipeline/content-graph.ts`, whose
  accessors default to it. Auditing: the `uses` QA axis (mechanical) plus the
  `uses-editorial-review` skill (human/agent). Contract: `BlockBase.uses` in
  `schemas/types.ts`.
- Lean tooling roadmap (Lean Atlas / Compass, Nazrin, refactor cluster,
  LeanDojo) — where each earns a place and how it wires into existing skills:
  `docs/proposals/llm-authoring-tool-integration.md`.
- Migration plan + cross-repo coordination: `docs/folio-assistant-migration.md`.
- Skills live under `skills/` (packages) and `.claude/skills/` (local + capabilities).
- Shipping a branch — `/prepare-merge [base]` runs the generic recipe plus this
  folio's **content-type-specific** gates (paper → content_validate / qa_sweep /
  proof_status / latex_preflight / lean_build; WHO IG → fhir-validation / QC),
  then pushes. It does not merge. Command: `.claude/commands/prepare-merge.md`;
  full discipline: `.claude/skills/local/prepare-merge.md`.
- Watching a sibling PR — `/watch <pr|branch>` subscribes to a PR's CI / review /
  comment activity and follows through until it's merged or closed:
  `.claude/commands/watch.md`.
- User-facing docs site (README + install + guides + generated schema/API
  reference): `docs/` → published to <https://litlfred.github.io/folio-assistant/>
  by `.github/workflows/docs-site.yml`. Regenerate the generated references with
  `bun run scripts/gen-schema-docs.ts` (schema reference → `docs/reference/skills/*`)
  and `bun run scripts/gen-skill-docs.ts` (instruction bodies →
  `docs/reference/skill-instructions/*`). Never hand-edit either generated dir.
