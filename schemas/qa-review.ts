/**
 * QA review — findings, decisions, and the audit notes that justify them.
 *
 * Three entities, deliberately not one. The corpus arrived at this module
 * carrying **two vocabularies for what looked like a single act**, and the
 * obvious move — pick one, migrate the other — is the wrong one:
 *
 * ```
 * content-review skill output:  decision: approve | request-changes | reject
 *                               severity: blocking | suggestion | praise
 * QA sidecar entry:             result:   pass | fail | warn | n/a
 *                               severity: critical | major | minor
 * ```
 *
 * ## A finding is an observation; a decision is an act about findings
 *
 * Neither determines the other. A `critical` mechanical finding can be
 * overruled by someone with the standing to overrule it, and an `approve` can
 * be issued over findings that are still open. Collapsing the two makes the
 * gate unable to express the only two situations that actually need a record:
 * a defect nobody is going to fix, and an approval granted in spite of one.
 *
 * ## The two severity vocabularies are two axes, not two spellings
 *
 * {@link FindingSeverity} (`critical | major | minor`) says **what kind of
 * breakage** this is: a broken reference, a missing join, a coverage gap. It
 * is a property of the defect and a machine can assign it.
 *
 * {@link FindingWeight} (`blocking | suggestion | praise`) says **what the
 * reviewer asks of the gate**. It is a stance, not a measurement.
 *
 * The proof they are different axes is `praise`, which has no image at all
 * under the machine axis: a mechanical criterion's only good outcome is
 * silence, so "this is well done, keep it" is unsayable there. That is the
 * human axis doing something the machine axis cannot, and mapping it onto
 * `minor` would have deleted it.
 *
 * So a finding carries whichever axis its reviewer can speak on, and
 * {@link checkReview} requires the right one rather than defaulting a
 * mechanical finding into a stance nobody took.
 *
 * ## An overruled finding stays recorded
 *
 * Overruling is not deletion. The {@link Finding} is immutable once raised;
 * the {@link Decision} records the overrule, and every overrule of a
 * **mechanical** finding carries an {@link AuditNote} saying why. A gate whose
 * findings vanish when somebody disagrees with them cannot be audited — the
 * next reader cannot tell a defect that was considered and accepted from one
 * that was never seen.
 *
 * ## An audit note cites
 *
 * A rationale with no citation is an assertion. {@link AuditNote.cites} carries
 * {@link Citation}s into the corpus — a witness, another finding, a QA report,
 * a block, a file range, a bibliographic key, a workflow instance. Agents are
 * expected to *propose* those citations from corpus evidence
 * ({@link AuditNote.proposed_by}); a human confirming a proposed note is
 * recorded as its author, because the reasoning is theirs.
 *
 * ## Citation resolution has three outcomes, and one of them is not a pass
 *
 * {@link resolveCitations} returns `resolved`, `dangling` or `not-checked`.
 * `not-checked` is what you get when no corpus resolver was supplied, or when
 * the resolver itself could not answer — a shallow clone, an absent submodule.
 * It is never rendered as `resolved`. Same rule as `check-ci-health.ts`,
 * `readme-sections.ts` and `kg-qa.ts`: "could not determine" is a third state
 * everywhere in this repo.
