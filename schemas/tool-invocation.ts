/**
 * What happened when a Tool ran, and under whose authority.
 *
 * ## Why this reuses the review vocabulary instead of inventing one
 *
 * `schemas/qa-review.ts` already models "an act, by someone with the standing
 * to make it, with a rationale that cites its evidence" — `Decision`,
 * `AuditNote`, `ReviewerRef` — and `schemas/role-graph.ts` already models who
 * may act: skills belong to the **lane** (what the performer must know),
 * permissions travel with the **actor** (what the participant may do).
 *
 * An invocation is the same shape one level down. Something was *done*, by an
 * actor, in a role, at a step of a process, exercising a skill, through a Tool.
 * Minting a second vocabulary for that would give the repository two answers to
 * "who did this and why", free to disagree — the defect `AGENTS.md` records
 * everywhere else it has appeared.
 *
 * ## What an invocation record has to answer
 *
 * Not "what ran" — a shell history answers that. The questions an audit asks:
 *
 * - **Which task?** A BPMN node id, so the run is locatable in a process.
 * - **In which process instance?** So a sequence of runs is one story.
 * - **Under which role?** The lane, which is what says the step was allowed.
 * - **By which actor?** The participant, which is what carries permissions.
 * - **Exercising which skill?** The capability, which the Tool `satisfies` —
 *   and which is the edge that makes "was this Tool appropriate here" decidable.
 * - **With what inputs?** Recorded as the parsed, type-checked values, never
 *   the raw request.
 *
 * ## The one thing deliberately not recorded
 *
 * Output is not stored here. A Tool's stdout may be large, may contain
 * credentials a caller passed to it, and is already the caller's to handle. The
 * record carries an outcome and a digest; whoever needs the bytes keeps them.
 *
