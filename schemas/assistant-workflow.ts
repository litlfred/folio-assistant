/**
 * The stages of the content development lifecycle.
 *
 * | Stage | Description | Key activities |
 * |-------|-------------|----------------|
 * | `plan` | Scope the work | Outlining, dependency ordering, triage |
 * | `author` | Create or modify content | Authoring, formalization, editing |
 * | `validate` | Automated checks | Schema, AST, constraint, type checking |
 * | `review` | Human or agent review | Accuracy, style, proof correctness |
 * | `test` | Integration testing | Build, CI, regression, proof compilation |
 * | `publish` | Release to audience | PDF, HTML, gh-pages, IG Publisher |
 * | `feedback` | Collect responses | Todos, issues, comments, annotations |
 * | `retire` | Withdraw content | Deprecation, supersession, archival |
 *
 * Re-exported from `./types.js`, where it is `z.infer` of
 * `LifecycleStageSchema` — not redeclared. This module used to declare its own
 * seven-member version with `develop` and `revise` in place of `plan`,
 * `author` and `retire`. Every stage value on disk (18 skill definitions and 5
 * package manifests) comes from the Zod enum: `author` alone appears 18 times,
 * `plan` 7 and `retire` 4, while `develop` and `revise` appear nowhere at all.
 * The redeclared type was unreachable from the `schemas/` barrel, which
 * exports `types.js` and not this module, so the two never met and the wrong
 * one simply sat here contradicting the published schema reference.
