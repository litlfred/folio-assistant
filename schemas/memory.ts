/**
 * An agent's memory — what it carries into the next task, as a graph node.
 *
 * @module schemas/memory
 *
 * The agent half of the memory column. See `schemas/carried-note.ts` for the
 * shared base and for why a todo and a memory entry are the same thing wearing
 * different storage.
 *
 * ## The file an agent reads is GENERATED, not this
 *
 * `memory: project` is a Claude Code **harness** feature: it injects the first
 * 200 lines of `.claude/agent-memory/<agent>/MEMORY.md` into a subagent's
 * system prompt. The harness decides where it looks, so that path is not ours
 * to move, and this module does not try. The relation is the one
 * `docs/reference/skill-instructions/` already has to `skills/` — entries are
 * authored here, scoped, and **assembled** into the file the harness reads.
 *
 * ## Why scope by role, and not by agent
 *
 * Memory is bound to the agent today, and the agent is an **actor**.
 * `AGENTS.md` states the rule for knowledge: *"A skill is what the performer
 * needs to KNOW and belongs to the lane; a permission is what the participant
 * may DO and travels with them."* Memory is knowledge, so it belongs to the
 * lane.
 *
 * **{@link memoryForRoles} is not dead code, and this comment briefly implied
 * it was.** The lane for at least one of the three memory-carrying subagents
 * is already declared: `ci-health-watcher` is a mechanical participant in the
 * CI process, and `roles.json` carries `build-pipeline` and
 * `validation-pipeline` — both `actorKind: "system"`, both described as
 * running a fixed program and exercising no judgement — with the `ci-pipeline`
 * actor already taking both. Owner, 2026-09-19: *"ci watchers are
 * agents/mechanical roles that are part of the CI process."* Bean `29ij`.
 *
 * The judgement-free property is doing the work there, which is why it does
 * NOT settle the other two: a platform-boundary guard exercises judgement, and
 * a `system` lane excludes exactly that.
 *
 * That is not a tidiness argument. Measured 2026-09-19 across
 * `.claude/agent-memory/`, by parsing all three files rather than reading
 * them: **28 entries over 3 agents, with 3 subject areas duplicated** between
 * `content-pipeline-navigator` and `platform-boundary-guard` — the document
 * render path taking no TeX (near-verbatim), adapter-vs-profile, and what the
 * schema structurally cannot catch. One fact, two files, free to drift apart,
 * and that duplication is *caused by* agent-scoping: there is nowhere shared
 * to put a thing two agents both need.
 *
 * **An earlier revision of this comment said 5, and named the BASELINE
 * "re-measure, do not quote" as one of the two near-verbatim pairs. Both
 * claims were wrong**, and the second is the instructive one: the two files DO
 * carry that heading identically, and their bodies are **disjoint** — one
 * tabulates pipeline entrypoints and sidecar staleness, the other
 * folio-specific literals and README staleness. Same title, two different
 * facts, and merging them would have destroyed one.
 *
 * The number came from reading the files; the correction came from parsing
 * them. That is this module's own BASELINE rule turned on its own
 * documentation — a count in prose is a claim, not evidence — and it is
 * recorded here rather than quietly amended because the failure is the point.
 *
 * ## `BASELINE` must carry its provenance, and now structurally
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` says a BASELINE is *"a measured number, stored **with the command
 * that produced it and the date**, and never quoted as a current answer."*
 * That has been prose discipline, and prose discipline is what
 * `judgementOnly` was invented to replace after a stakeholder rule stated only
 * in a summary came within one commit of being overturned.
 *
 * So {@link MemoryNodeSchema} **refuses a `baseline` entry without `measured`**.
 * A number whose command and date are missing is a claim, not evidence, and
 * the schema is where that stops being a thing somebody has to remember.
 *

   *
   * ## Why the schema needs this rather than "write shorter entries"
   *
   * The harness injects the FIRST 200 lines of `MEMORY.md`, and `AGENTS.md`
   * prescribes the remedy — *"split detail into sibling files the agent reads
   * on demand"* — but there was no mechanism, so the only lever was brevity.
   * Brevity runs out: measured 2026-09-19, `content-pipeline-navigator` held
   * twelve entries ending at line 199, one line under the cut. It FIT, and it
   * could not accept a thirteenth. Adding four pushed two existing entries
   * past the cut, where the harness drops them silently.
   *
   * That is the trap worth naming: a file at capacity punishes the NEXT
   * writer, not the one who filled it, and the failure is invisible — the
   * agent simply behaves as though the entry was never recorded, which is the
   * whole premise of having memory.
   *
   * ## What belongs here rather than in `comment`
   *
   * `comment` is the TRIGGER: what goes wrong, in the fewest words that let an
   * agent recognise the situation. `detail` is the evidence — the measurement,
   * the worked example, the enumeration of paths. An agent that recognises the
   * trigger can go and read it; one that does not was never going to be helped
   * by having it inlined.
   *
