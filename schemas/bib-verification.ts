/**
 * Bibliography verification schema — `content/bib-qa-verifications.json`.
 *
 * This file is the typed contract for the per-paper verification roster.
 * Each entry records a single examination of a reference against either a
 * local PDF or an external source.  Until 2026-05-31 the `verified_by`
 * field was free-text ("Claude (claude-opus-4-7)" etc.) and downstream
 * tools had no way to distinguish an agent claim from a human
 * adjudication.  The discriminated `Verifier` union below makes that
 * distinction first-class so the dashboard, `validate-bib`, and the
 * authors-note disclosure can treat the two cases differently.
 *
 * Migration history:
 *   2026-05-19  initial roster with free-text `verified_by`
 *   2026-05-20  `_verified_by_caveat` schema-level annotation
 *   2026-05-31  Verifier discriminated union (this commit)
 *
 * Backward-compat note: `bib-qa.ts` and `validate-bib.ts` parse the new
 * shape strictly.  The migration script
 * `content/pipeline/migrate-bib-verifier.ts` converts every legacy
 * free-text entry to the structured shape in one pass.

// ─── Source ledger (2026-08-08) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The roster above answers "was this reference checked against a source?".
// It is extended here to also answer "is the source *relevant*, and what
// should the author do about it?" — the paper-relevance triage.
//
// ## One source of truth
//
// The ledger stores judgements, never bibliography.  Exactly one file owns
// each fact:
//
// | Fact                                   | Owner                              |
// |----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
// | title, authors, year, DOI, URL, type   | `content/schema/references.ts`     |
// | source document ↔ reference join       | this ledger (`source` + `id`)      |
// | was the source checked                 | this ledger (`status`)             |
// | is it relevant, what to do about it    | this ledger (`relevance`)          |
// | the resulting work items               | `.beans/`                          |
//
// A ledger entry therefore carries NO bibliographic metadata — no `title`,
// no `authors`, no `year`.  It points at a reference by `id` and the
// consumer joins.  A reviewer who wants a title for an orphan reads it out
// of the PDF at display time; it is never written here, because the moment
// a source is judged worth citing the triage's first action is to create
// its `ref()` entry, and metadata is born in `references.ts` or nowhere.
//
// Migration history:
//   2026-08-08  `source` discriminated union + `relevance` block; `id`
//               becomes nullable so a local document with no reference yet
//               (an "orphan" upload) is a first-class row.  `local_pdf` is
//               superseded by `source: { kind: "upload", file }` and is
//               retained only as a deprecated read-path for old consumers.
