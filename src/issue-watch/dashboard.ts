/**
 * The project-management dashboard an agent maintains in an issue's body.
 *
 * #203 (2026-09-18): a folio's project manager should get status at a glance,
 * and someone meeting the issue for the first time — or after a long gap —
 * should not have to read forty comments to find out where it stands.
 *
 * ## The rule this module exists to enforce
 *
 * **A field is either computed or it is not determined.** The requested status
 * vocabulary splits cleanly in two, and rendering both halves with the same
 * badge would make the dashboard uniformly authoritative while half of it was
 * guesswork:
 *
 *   COMPUTED   `synchronized` · `ready for review` · `dirty` — all derivable
 *              from the branch, the publish ref and the staging build.
 *   ASSERTED   `stalled`, level of effort, "expected to finish in …" — these
 *              are judgements, and an agent has no measurement behind them.
 *
 * So the asserted half renders as **not determined**, with a note saying who
 * can fill it in. That is the same doctrine the README sections and the CI
 * health report already follow: "could not determine" is a third state, never
 * rendered as the good one.
 *
 * Getting this wrong is not cosmetic. A PM reading an effort estimate styled
 * like a measurement will plan against it.
 */

/**
 * The branch head that a staging build's reported sha corresponds to.
 *
 * THE STAGING COMMENT DOES NOT REPORT THE BRANCH HEAD. `feature-staging.yml`
 * stamps `${{ github.sha }}`, and on a `pull_request` event that is the MERGE
 * COMMIT GitHub synthesises at `refs/pull/N/merge` — a commit that does not
 * exist in a contributor's clone at all, so comparing it to `git rev-parse
 * HEAD` fails in a way that looks like "staging is stale" rather than like
 * "you are comparing the wrong things".
 *
 * Its second parent is the branch head. Measured 2026-09-18 on PR #249:
 * reported `dbf361c`, parents `6dc2f29` (base) and `d645772` (head), where
 * `d645772` was the branch head — so staging was current while a naive
 * comparison said otherwise.
 *
 * Returns undefined when the merge ref cannot be fetched, because "could not
 * tell" must not collapse into "stale".
