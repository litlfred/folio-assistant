/**
 * Project a Tool node onto the MCP standard.
 *
 * The mapping is `skills/folio-core/mcp-projection.md`. This is the
 * implementation, and it is a **library**: it produces declarations and argv,
 * and records what an invocation was authorised to do. It does not register
 * anything on a running server, because the harness is meant to carry no tools
 * of its own — the twelve hand-written MCP tools in `src/tools/` are content to
 * be migrated OUT, and wiring this to them would build on the thing being
 * removed.
 *
 * ## Three rules the skill states, enforced here
 *
 * **`invoke.mcp` is never a projection source.** A Tool already reachable over
 * MCP is skipped; a generator treating every arm uniformly emits a server that
 * proxies itself. (`ToolDefinitionSchema` already refuses an mcp-ONLY Tool, so
 * this handles the Tool that has both.)
 *
 * **An unmet `requires` means NOT LISTED**, never listed-and-failing.
 * `tools/list` is what a model plans against, so advertising a tool that cannot
 * run makes every plan containing it wrong. The omission is *reported*, not
 * silent — three states, as everywhere here.
 *
 * **Arguments reach the process as argv, never spliced into a shell string.**
 * That is the second line of defence and it is unconditional. The first line is
 * that the values cannot be payloads: every input references a type from
 * `schemas/tool-types.ts` that refuses shell metacharacters, and a Tool whose
 * input references an unconstrained type is rejected before it is ever run.
 *
