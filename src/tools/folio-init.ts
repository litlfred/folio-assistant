/**
 * `folio_init` — scaffold a new folio from within an agent session.
 *
 * This is the tool behind "initialize a new paper using litlfred/folio-assistant"
 * typed into a bare repository. It is a thin wrapper over
 * `scripts/init-folio.ts`, which holds the templates and the layout decisions;
 * everything here is about being callable safely from an agent.
 *
 * ## Registered as a generic tool, deliberately
 *
 * It sits beside `check_dependencies` and `skill_fetch` rather than in a
 * content adapter, because it runs *before* the folio has a content type. A
 * bare repo has no `folio.config.json`, so adapter selection falls back to
 * `paper` — and a tool that only the document adapter registered would be
 * unreachable in exactly the situation it exists for.
