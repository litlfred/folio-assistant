 * `readme_audit` — check that a folio README's links still resolve.

 * Companion to `readme_sync`, and deliberately the other half of it: sync owns
 * the generated regions and writes them; audit owns everything the author
 * wrote and never writes anything. Between them, no link in the file is
 * unaccounted for.
