/**
 * `readme_sync` — refresh the generated sections of a folio's README.
 *
 * Generic, not adapter-scoped: a document folio has chapters, simulators and
 * workflows to list for the same reason a paper folio does, and the block
 * kinds never enter into it. The Lean sections simply never appear in a
 * document folio's README, because a folio opts into a section by carrying
 * its markers.
 *
 * The work lives in `content/pipeline/readme-sections.ts`; this is the MCP
 * surface over it, so an agent can refresh the README after adding a chapter
 * without knowing the script's path or flag spelling.
 *
 * @module src/tools/readme-sync
