"""Import pypdf robustly, including when `cryptography` is installed but broken.

pypdf's import chain reaches `cryptography` to provide its encrypted-PDF
support. In a container where `cryptography` is installed but its Rust
extension cannot load, that import raises **`pyo3_runtime.PanicException`**,
which derives from `BaseException` rather than `Exception`. So the usual

    try:
        from pypdf import PdfReader
    except ImportError:
        sys.exit("... pip install pypdf")

does not catch it — and neither would `except Exception`. The caller sees a
Rust backtrace and a non-zero exit, with nothing pointing at the real cause:

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_cffi_backend'
    thread '<unnamed>' panicked at pyo3-0.20.2/src/err/mod.rs:788:5
    pyo3_runtime.PanicException: Python API call failed

pypdf needs `cryptography` **only** for encrypted PDFs, and falls back to its
own no-crypto provider when the module is simply absent. So on that failure we
make it absent for this process and retry the import once. Reading unencrypted
PDFs — which is all the structure/extract/OCR/split scripts do — is unaffected;
an encrypted PDF then fails with pypdf's own clear `DependencyError` instead of
a panic.

History: added 2026-08-25 after the panic was hit in a qou session, misread as
permanent, and worked around with a duplicate ingester on the qou side rather
than fixed here. The duplicate was the wrong shape — `pdf-structure.py` is the
owner of `pdf-structure/v1` and there should be exactly one producer of it.

Usage:

    from _pypdf_compat import import_pypdf
    PdfReader, PdfWriter = import_pypdf("PdfReader", "PdfWriter")
