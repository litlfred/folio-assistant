/**
 * Remove the SEO IDENTITY CLAIMS from a built preview site.
 *
 * A staging preview is a build of a branch, served from
 * `…/STAGING/<slug>/`. `jekyll-seo-tag` gives every page three assertions
 * about its own identity, composed from `site.url + baseurl + page.url`:
 *
 *   <link rel="canonical" href="https://…/STAGING/<slug>/x.html">
 *   <meta property="og:url" content="https://…/STAGING/<slug>/x.html">
 *   <script type="application/ld+json">{… "@type":"WebPage","url":"…"}</script>
 *
 * **A preview must not make them.** `canonical` tells a crawler which URL is
 * authoritative for this content, and a branch build naming itself authoritative
 * invites the preview into a search index in place of the published page — then
 * outlives nothing, because the directory is pruned. `og:url` is the same claim
 * to a link unfurler, and the JSON-LD block is the same claim to a structured-data
 * consumer. Three audiences, one wrong assertion.
 *
 * This is a CORRECTNESS fix and not, on its own, a size fix. It removes 3 of the
 * ~238 slug-bearing references on a page, so git still cannot deduplicate the
 * page against another preview's copy of it — see bean `xxku` for the other three
 * sources, of which the build timestamp in the staging banner is the one that
 * makes every page unique even across two builds of ONE branch.
 *
 * Why a post-build pass rather than Jekyll config: `jekyll-seo-tag` ships in the
 * `github-pages` gem set that `actions/jekyll-build-pages` runs, it has no global
 * off switch, and the `{% seo %}` call lives in the REMOTE theme's `head.html`.
 * Suppressing it at the source would mean vendoring that file — which is the
 * upstream-coupling hazard each folio's Jekyll config pins the theme to avoid.
 * (Naming that file's path here is not possible: a glob segment inside it spells
 * the block-comment CLOSING delimiter, which has no escape — the same asymmetry
 * `head_custom.html` records after it cost two red deploys. Describe, never
 * spell.) A pass
 * over the emitted tree couples to nothing.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT idempotency-sensitive: running it twice is a no-op,
 * because the second run finds nothing to remove.
