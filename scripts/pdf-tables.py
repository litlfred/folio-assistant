pdf-tables — the deterministic table and figure rung.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  `pdf-structure/v1`'s `Section` carries `id`, `number`,
`title`, `level`, `page_start`, `page_end`, `n_chars`, `n_words`, `text` — and
nothing else.  No tables, no figures, no bounding boxes.
`docs/proposals/rag-document-ingestion.md` §12 opens by naming that as the
schema's central defect, and it is not cosmetic: a GRADE evidence table or a
boxed WHO recommendation is a *layout* fact, and a text extractor flattens it
into a run of prose that reads exactly like prose.  Once flattened, no
downstream consumer can tell that the numbers it is reading were a 4x7 grid.

WHY NOT DOCLING, WHICH IS THE BETTER PARSER.  This does not replace it.
Docling's layout, TableFormer and formula weights are fetched from HuggingFace
on first use, and both `huggingface.co` and `cdn-lfs.huggingface.co` answer

    curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403

here — re-measured 2026-08-26, eleven days after §2a first recorded it, with
`pypi.org` answering 200 in the same sweep.  `pip install docling` therefore
succeeds and the *first parse* is what fails.  That makes Docling a
workstation/CI stage whose artefacts get committed (§10 Stage 3), and makes
this the rung that runs in the sandboxed sessions where most agent work
happens.  Both backends below are pure-Python-plus-wheels: no weights, no
egress at all after the install.

THE AMBIGUITY THIS EXISTS TO KILL.  An empty `tables[]` has three completely
different meanings — "this document has no tables", "no backend was
installed", and "this is a scan, so its tables are pixels" — and §5's contract
is *absent tool => n/a, never a false pass*.  So they are three different exit
codes, and in the artefact they are three different **shapes**:

    "tables": []      the backend looked and found none      status "ok"
    "tables": null    nothing looked                         status "n/a-*"

`null` is not `[]`.  A consumer that forgets to check `status` still cannot
read an unparsed document as an empty one, which is the whole point.

TWO BACKENDS, BOTH DELIBERATE.

  * **pdfplumber** (MIT) — the default.  Small, and it is already the tool
    `skills/authoring-who-smart-guidelines/smart-base-tools.md` depends on, so
    it is not a new dependency for this platform so much as a second use of an
    existing one.
  * **camelot-py** (MIT) — preferred when installed.  Camelot **2.0** dropped
    Ghostscript to an optional extra (`camelot-py[ghostscript]`); the base
    install is numpy/pandas/opencv-headless/pypdfium2/playa-pdf and nothing
    else, verified importing and extracting offline here on 2026-08-26.  Its
    advantage over pdfplumber is not accuracy on a ruled grid — measured on the
    two-page fixture in `scripts/tests/pdf-tables.test.py` both return
    identical cells and identical column edges — but that it reports a
    per-table `parsing_report.accuracy`.  That number lands in `confidence`,
    and a consumer can weight by it.  pdfplumber offers no equivalent, so
    `confidence` is `null` there rather than invented.

STITCHING IS OURS, NOT THE BACKEND'S.  A table continuing across a page break
is extracted by every tool as two tables, because that is what is on the two
pages.  Rejoining them is a judgement about column geometry, and it is made
here — over `col_edges`, which both backends report identically — so it works
the same whichever backend ran.  Three guards, because a wrong stitch welds two
unrelated tables into one and is worse than not stitching:

  1. consecutive pages only;
  2. same column count, every edge within `--col-tol` points;
  3. a continuation that carries its own `Table N` caption with a *different*
     N is a new table, and is never stitched however well its columns line up.

A repeated header row on the continuation is dropped, and `stitched_from`
records what was merged so the decision is auditable rather than invisible.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO.  It does not caption vector art it cannot name: a cluster
of drawing primitives is emitted as `kind: "vector-cluster"` with a primitive
count, explicitly a *candidate*, because deciding that fourteen curves are one
figure is exactly the judgement Docling's layout model exists to make.  It does
not read a scan.  It does not classify figures.  Those are Stage 3's, and the
capability probe in `.claude/skills/capabilities/docling.json` is what lets a
consumer see that Stage 3 has not run instead of guessing.

Usage:
    pdf-tables.py FILE.pdf -o uploads/<doc-id>/
    pdf-tables.py FILE.pdf --backend camelot     # force a backend
    pdf-tables.py FILE.pdf --no-stitch           # keep page-split tables apart
    pdf-tables.py --check                        # which backends are present

Exit codes:
    0  artefact written (`tables` may legitimately be `[]`)
    2  no text layer -- the tables here are pixels; use OCR or Docling
    3  a backend was present and failed
    4  bad usage / unreadable file
    5  no backend installed -- artefact written as n/a, `tables` is null
