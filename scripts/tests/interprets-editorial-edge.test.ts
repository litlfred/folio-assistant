/**
 * `interprets` became an editorial edge on 2026-08-15 (owner decision, bean
 * `i8ad`). Before that the graph read `uses[]` alone while
 * `detangler-no-forward-ref` already refused to let a block precede one it
 * interprets — so a constraint was being enforced on a relation the graph did
 * not have, and 342 authored dependencies were absent from every cone, energy
 * and reachability measure.
 *
 * The field is parsed through the shared masked scanner rather than a fresh
 * regex, because a naive `/interprets:\s*"([^"]+)"/` falls to both traps this
 * area keeps producing: a comment before the field, and the field name quoted
 * inside prose. Neither is hypothetical here — this corpus discusses
 * `interprets:` by name in block bodies.
