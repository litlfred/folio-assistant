 * which after the repo split resolved to the platform tree — so it walked
 * `<platform>/content/quantum-observable-universe`, found nothing, and
 * **exited 0**. Silent success is what made it invisible: the seven
 * `q-usage-*` criteria went unrefreshable in every downstream sidecar
 * while CI stayed green. Observed live on qou #4673.
 *
 * These pin the two halves of the fix: paper discovery must not hardcode
 * a name, and a zero-block sweep must not report success.
