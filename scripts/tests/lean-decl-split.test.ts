/**
 * `splitDeclarations` cuts each declaration into signature and body. Its
 * doc comment always said "at the first **top-level** `:=` or `where`";
 * the implementation was `text.search(/:=|\bwhere\b/)`, which finds the
 * first one *anywhere*.
 *
 * A theorem statement may legitimately contain `:=` — a `let`, a
 * structure instance, an anonymous constructor — and every consumer of
 * the split degrades quietly when the cut lands inside one:
 *
 * - `lean-signature` hashes the truncated signature, so a changed
 *   statement can hash identically and never invalidate its QA sidecar;
 * - `lean-triviality-probe` splices its tactic over the statement, the
 *   file stops elaborating, and the declaration is recorded as
 *   "not machine-trivial";
 * - scan mode files statement text under `value_deps`.
 *
 * None of the three surfaces an error. That is what these pin.
