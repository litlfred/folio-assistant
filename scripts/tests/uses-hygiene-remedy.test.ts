/**
 * `uses-editorial-hygiene` reports a `uses[]` entry as transitively redundant
 * when another entry already reaches it. Which relation it walks to decide
 * that is the whole question.
 *
 * **Owner ruling 2026-08-24.** Sending a reader to a remark ABOUT B lets them
 * take B's assertions for granted, and follow the reference if they want more.
 * It does NOT mean they have read B's prerequisites. So an `interprets` edge
 * transmits nothing forward, and an entry reachable only through one is not
 * redundant — the reader still needs it named directly.
 *
 * That is also what the criterion was specified to do (bean
 * `folio-assistant-r0ax`, 2026-08-07: "transitive redundancy — A uses B, B
 * uses C, A uses C"). It walked the full editorial cone, which meant `uses`
 * until `i8ad` (2026-08-15) made `interprets` an editorial edge and silently
 * widened it.
 *
 * The widening was not marginal. Over qou 2026-08-24, before this fix: 374
 * blocks warned, carrying 594 reports, and ALL 594 were `interprets`-only —
 * not one ran through `uses`. Each also named `prune-transitive-deps.ts`,
 * which reduces `uses[]` alone and would have reported nothing for any of
 * them: a remedy that no-ops on 100 % of the findings it is offered for.
 *
 * Asserted generically over whatever folio is attached; no label is hardcoded.
