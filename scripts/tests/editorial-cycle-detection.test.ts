/**
 * `detangler-no-dependency-cycle` scanned `uses[]` alone, so a cycle running
 * through an `interprets` edge was invisible — and one sat in the corpus
 * undetected: a remark interpreting a conjecture that `uses` the remark back.
 * "Read A before B and B before A" is just as circular whichever field carries
 * the leg.
 *
 * The fix runs cycle detection on the full editorial relation while leaving
 * `detangler-no-forward-ref` on `uses[]`. That separation is the point, and
 * these tests pin both halves of it: the checker must agree with the union
 * graph, and the forward-reference count must not have been widened as a side
 * effect — widening it moves a number several merged PRs were measured against.
 *
 * Asserted generically against whatever folio is attached, never against
 * specific labels: a test that hardcodes content is a test that breaks when the
 * content is right.
