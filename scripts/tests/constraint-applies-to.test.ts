/**
 * `validate.ts` gates every constraint on its `appliesTo` list:
 *
 *     if (!rule.appliesTo.includes(block.kind)) continue;
 *
 * A kind missing from that list is not reported as unchecked — it is
 * simply never checked. Which makes a short `appliesTo` the same defect
 * as a short block-kind regex, one layer down: the validator passes
 * because it never looked.
 *
 * Three rules were short for no reason. `cites` and `simulator` are
 * **BlockBase** fields, so every kind can carry one, and both checks
 * already return null when the field is absent — the narrower list only
 * removed coverage. `md-crossref-resolve` guards on `ctx.mdContent`, so
 * kinds without an `.md` were already no-ops.
 *
 * The rest are genuinely kind-specific, and this pins WHICH and WHY. A
 * new kind added to `Block` now has to be classified here: it either
 * lands in `BLOCK_KINDS` and every universal rule picks it up, or
 * someone states the reason it is exempt.
