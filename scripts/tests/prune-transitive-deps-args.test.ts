/**
 * Argv contract for `prune-transitive-deps.ts --paper <name>`.
 *
 * `--paper` takes the token after it. Before this guard that token was taken
 * unconditionally, so `--paper --apply` handed `requirePaper` the string
 * `"--apply"` — which it returns unchanged, an explicit name being trusted by
 * design — and the run failed much later looking for a paper directory called
 * `--apply`. Reported by the PR review bot on #151; the flag was added in the
 * same PR, so the hazard shipped with it.
 *
 * Run from an empty temp directory, above no content repo, so the results do
 * not depend on whether this checkout happens to sit beside a folio. That is
 * also what the third test pins: the usage error must be raised BEFORE repo
 * discovery, or a real usage mistake gets reported as "no content repo found".
