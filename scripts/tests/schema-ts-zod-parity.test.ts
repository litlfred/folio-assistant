/**
 * `schemas/types.ts` declares the `Block` union; `schemas/constraints.ts`
 * declares the Zod schemas that actually validate content. They had drifted,
 * in both directions:
 *
 *     kind        in TS not Zod     in Zod not TS
 *     diagram     title, uses       —
 *     prose       title, uses       —
 *     equation    —                 tags
 *
 * plus `equation` carrying no `uses` on either side — the only member of the
 * union with neither `uses` nor a base supplying it, while its three
 * standalone siblings (`prose`, `diagram`, `table`) all declare it.
 *
 * The Zod objects are neither `.strict()` nor `.passthrough()`, so the default
 * applies: an unknown key is **stripped, silently, and the parse succeeds**.
 * Verified — a prose block carrying `uses: ["def:a"]` parsed clean and came
 * back with `uses === undefined`. On the qou corpus that is 25 prose and 4
 * diagram blocks whose editorial edges vanished at the validation boundary,
 * and 106 blocks whose `title` did. AGENTS.md calls `uses[]` the relation
 * "every ordering metric is computed from".
 *
 * A field-name comparison is crude — it does not check types — but it is
 * exactly the class of drift that occurred, and it is cheap and total.
