/**
 * Six pipeline entry points imported the bibliography as
 * `../../schemas/references` — a path that does not exist in this repo. The
 * reference database is CONTENT (in qou it is `content/schema/references.ts`,
 * ~7900 lines of CSL-JSON), so it belongs to the folio the same way the values
 * registry and the Lake package list do.
 *
 * They did not merely fail to type-check. **Every one threw `Cannot find
 * module` at import**, so `validate-bib`, `bib-qa`, `export-bibtex`,
 * `export-json`, `validate-references` and `validate-references-human-review`
 * could not run at all. The whole bibliography subsystem was dead, and nothing
 * reported it: `content/**` was outside the tsconfig program, and nothing else
 * imports these entry points.
 *
 * Downstream cost, measured: qou's committed `references.bib` carries 372
 * entries against 463 in the CSL source, and a DOI corrected on 2026-07-06 is
 * absent from it. Its generator is `export-bibtex.ts`, which has been unable
 * to run since the split — so the LaTeX bibliography the paper builds from
 * silently froze on 2026-07-04.
 *
 * These pin the DI contract that replaces the direct import. The Proxy is what
 * lets the six consumers keep reading `references` as a plain array, so the
 * array-ness is the part worth testing.
