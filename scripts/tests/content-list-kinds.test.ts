/**
 * `content_list` reports a block's kind by reading the BUILDER it calls.
 *
 * It used to match `/kind:\s*["'](\w+)["']/` against the manifest source, and
 * no builder-authored manifest contains that: `prose({ label: … })` produces
 * `kind: "prose"` at *runtime*, and the source never spells it out. So the
 * match failed on every block in every folio and fell through to the
 * `"unknown"` default — found by scaffolding a real folio and listing it.
 *
 * These tests pin the property `content_list` now depends on, and pin that the
 * old regex genuinely could not have satisfied it. Asserting the fix works
 * without also asserting the old approach failed would leave open that the two
 * were equivalent and something else was wrong.
