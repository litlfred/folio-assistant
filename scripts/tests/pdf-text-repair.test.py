"""
Regression test for `pdf-structure.py`'s text repair.

PDF text extraction damages words in ways that look cosmetic and are not:
the damaged form is what lands in `structure.json`'s title, in the library
index brief, and in the section text that corpus-grep runs over. A search
for "Garoufalidis" does not match "GAROUF ALIDIS".

Every case below is real damage taken from the qou library, and each one
broke a *previous* version of the repair — which is the reason this file
exists rather than a one-off check:

  * pairwise joining could not fix "J ÉR ÔME", because the intermediate
    "JÉR" is not a word and so is never attested;
  * whole-concatenation lookup could not fix "GR ÖBNER-SHIRSHOV", because
    the word formed at the seam is "GRÖBNER", not "GRÖBNERSHIRSHOV";
  * first-seam-only lookup swallowed an entire title into one token, on a
    run whose first seam happened to be a real join.

Run: python3 scripts/tests/pdf-text-repair.test.py

Standalone by design — it loads the two functions out of the script's
source rather than importing it, so it runs in environments where pypdf
is unavailable.
