/**
 * Replace the locked mounts of an instance's dependency harness with those
 * layers at `main`, for `layer-publish-context.yml`.
 *
 * A context published from the caller's `main` is built from the prefix tables
 * of every instance it transitively `needs` (`gen-instance-contexts`
 * flattens them), and by the generator itself, which lives in
 * cat-harness-tools. The folio-assistant index's lock may pin any of those
 * before the tables or the generator existed (it did on 2026-10-15: the locked
 * cat-harness-tools had no `gen-instance-contexts.ts`), so they are taken at
 * `main`, the state the caller's own `main` is published against.
 *
 * The closure is read from the declarations AT MAIN: a layer's `needs` may
 * have changed since the lock, so each layer is fetched before its `needs`
 * are followed. cat-harness-tools is always taken, with its own needs, because
 * it holds the generator. The caller itself is never replaced.
 *
 * Imports only `node:*`: it runs before `bun install`.
 *
 * Usage: bun needs-at-main.ts <index-root> <instance> [--always cat-harness-tools] [--owner litlfred]
 *
 * @module .github/scripts/layer-publish-context/needs-at-main
