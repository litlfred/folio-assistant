"""Keep the one `main-red` issue of a repository in step with main's verdict.

Run by `layer-main-qa.yml` after a push to main was judged (owner,
2026-10-30, "Both": "each merge to main gets a full QA run that files an
issue when it is red"). Nothing is run here: the verdict is the gate run's.

Environment:
  VERDICT        green | red | unknown, main's own verdict, or empty when
                 the gate run gives none (its workflow conclusion is used).
  FAILURES       one line of JSON from main-verdict.py, or empty.
  CHECKS_RESULT  the gate run's result as the caller saw it (success,
                 failure, cancelled, skipped) or empty.
  GATE_RUN_ID    the workflow run that judged main.
  SHA            the commit of main it judged.
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_RUN_ID, GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY.

Red: the open `main-red` issue is updated (or one is opened) with the failing
gates, tests and jobs, and the commits since the last green main: the newest
successful push run of the gate run's workflow on main. Green: the open issue
is closed. Only the newest main reports: when SHA is no longer main's head, a
newer push's run reports instead, and the issue is not touched. Unknown, or a
cancelled gate run that gave no verdict: nothing is touched. A cancelled gate
run that still gave a green or red VERDICT is judged by that verdict: main's
gate set finished, and only a later job (the writer record) was cancelled.

Exits 1 when main is red, so the QA run itself is red; 0 otherwise.
