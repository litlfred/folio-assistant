"""Compare two run-gates.py reports and fail on a gate the PR newly breaks.

Usage: compare-gates.py <base.json> <head.json>

A gate fails the PR when it exits non-zero on head and exited 0 on base, or
when head has a gate base did not run and it fails. A gate red on both is
listed, not counted: it is main's to fix, and failing every PR on it would
teach `|| true`. Exit 2 from a gate is "could not determine" in this
harness's convention; it is reported, and it counts as a failure only when
base determined (0 or 1) and head did not. Exit 78 is "not applicable in
this root" (`scripts/lib/not-applicable.ts`): on head it is listed and never
counted, whatever base exited (#1701). Either one, on a gate base did
not run at all, is listed and never counted: there is no base answer for head
to have lost (smart-immunizations-uganda#15, where `check:unlinked-beans`
exited 78 and `folio:shim:check` 2 on gates main had not yet run, and both
read as NEW FAILURE). A gate run-gates.py skipped
(a `skipped` reason, no `exit`) is listed as skipped and never counted; on
base it reads as not run. Writes a Markdown summary to
$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY when set.

A gate the CI cone skipped (`unchanged: <sha>` beside `skipped`,
cat-harness-tools#398, bean `4rbc`) was not run because every input that its
green traced run on main `<sha>` read is unchanged. It is listed as
"SKIPPED — inputs unchanged since <sha>", never as a pass. On head it is never
counted. On base it stands for that recorded green run: a head failure
against it is NEW, exactly as against a base that exited 0, because base's
inputs were that green run's.

A gate that carries `diagnostics` on both sides (`run-root-gates.py`: the
errors and findings it printed, line numbers and counts left out, by
`gate_diagnostics.py`, which `run-gates.py` uses too) is judged finer when it is red on
both: a diagnostic head holds more times than base is NEW, so a gate already
red on main still fails the PR that adds an error to it. Without them on both
sides, red on both stays "failing on main too".
