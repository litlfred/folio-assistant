"""Carry one side's prepared root from the prepare job to its shards.

cat-harness-tools#397. Every shard used to rebuild the same root: mount the
layers, take the lower ones at main, swap the caller in, mount the graphs kept
on branches, build the IG pages and run `derive:publish`. On smart-base run
38866215814 that was 6-10 minutes in each of eight shards, about 67 of the
run's 200 work-minutes, for one answer per side.

Now the prepare job of each side does it once and hands the shards what
changed. A shard mounts the same lock itself (the mount cache makes that a
few seconds), then applies this snapshot, so it holds the same tree.

  snapshot.py mark <root> <list>           every file under <root> now, with
                                           its inode, size and mtime
  snapshot.py save <root> <list> <out>     after preparing: <out>.tar (files
                                           new or changed since <list>) and
                                           <out>.deleted
  snapshot.py apply <root> <out>           in a shard: remove the deleted
                                           paths and the directories they
                                           leave empty, then unpack the tar

`node_modules` and `.git` are left out: a shard installs for itself, and the
mounts carry no `.git`. The one exception is the root's `.git/branch-mounts`:
`mountTip` (branch-store.ts) files each graph's mount marker there, in the
git directory rather than the mount, and the shard's own checkout of the same
commit has none. A path that was replaced keeps its name in the tar and
loses its old copy. A file counts as changed when its inode, size or mtime
differs from the mark, not when it is newer than the mark: the caller is
swapped in with `mv`, which keeps the mtimes of its checkout, older than the
mark, but every moved-in file is a different inode.
