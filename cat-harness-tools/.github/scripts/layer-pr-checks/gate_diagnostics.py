"""The errors a gate printed, as keys that survive a re-run: one module for both runners.

`run-root-gates.py` (the index's own gates) and `run-gates.py` (every declared
gate) record `diagnostics` beside each gate's exit code, and
`compare-gates.py` fails a PR on a diagnostic head holds more times than base.
That is what lets a gate already red on main still judge a PR: without it a
gate red on both sides is "failing on main too" whatever the PR added
(folio-assistant-core#630 added a wrong-direction reference to
`check:reference-direction:check`, red on main, and passed).

Each key leaves out line numbers, columns and counts, so an error that only
moved, or a count that went down, is not new. Five shapes are read:

- `tsc`: `file(line,col): error TSnnnn: message`, and the file-less `error TSnnnn: message`;
- ESLint's stylish report: a file line, then `  line:col  error  message  rule`;
- the harness's qa-results baseline (`scripts/qa-results.ts`), printed by every
  `--against <ref>` gate: `new in <family>:` then `  + {json}` per new finding;
- a harness `✗ <finding>` line, unless it opens with a count (`✗ 6 finding(s):`,
  `✗ 1 kind JSON Schema finding(s) —`), keyed by its text;
- the indented items under a counted `✗ N ...:` heading, keyed by the item
  (`libraries:check`).

In the last two every number (`3`, `1.5`, `1.4.4`) reads as `#` (cat-harness-tools#1457), so a count
inside a finding that only went down (`3 contract(s)` to `2`) is not new, and
every commit id reads as `<commit>`, so a re-pin that leaves a lock mismatch
main already has is not new either (who-iris#239).
Repeats are kept, so two findings that differ only in a number count as two.
`run-gates.py`'s `findings()` is this function.

A gate that printed none of them is judged by its exit code alone, as before.
