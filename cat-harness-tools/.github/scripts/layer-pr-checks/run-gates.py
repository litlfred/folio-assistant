"""Run a harnessed repository's gates in a mounted index and record each exit code.

Usage: run-gates.py <index-root> <out.json> [--instance <name>]... [--record <file.json>]...

Generalised from folio-assistant-core's `.github/scripts/run-gates.py`
(14ed7ad) for `layer-pr-checks.yml`, the reusable workflow every harnessed
repository calls (owner, 2026-10-14: "1" -- one reusable workflow, not a copy
per repository). The gate set is DERIVED, never listed per repository, so a
gate added anywhere is run with no edit here. Owner, 2026-10-14: "A harnessed
repo should run not just core but all of the checks in the dependency
harness":

- **graph**: the harness's consistency checks, run over each OWN instance
  (`GRAPH_GATES` below is the only list, and it is a list of harness
  commands, not of any repository's gates).
- **declared**: for every instance in the own instances' transitive `needs`
  (from their declarations), and the own instances themselves, every script
  of its `package.json` -- `scripts` and `checkoutScripts` alike -- whose
  name starts `check:` or ends `:check`, named `<owning-instance>:<script>`.
- **checkout scripts**: the few declared scripts that judge the root's own
  files (`CHECKOUT_SCRIPTS` below), run for every caller under the same name,
  whether or not its dependency harness includes the declaring instance.

The OWN instances are the `--instance` arguments; with none, the instance the
repository declares at its root (a folio or an index with a declaration of
its own), or else every instance its `index.config.json` mounts (an IG
repository that is an index over smart-base and declares nothing itself).

Each gate's exit code, the tail of its output, and its command are written to
<out.json>. This script exits 0 whatever the gates did: the compare step
judges head against base, so a gate already red on main does not fail a PR
that did not break it. `GATE_JOBS` (default 1) runs that many at once.
Each gate's wall time is recorded as `seconds`.

`GATE_SHARD=i/N` (bean `lpcs`, step 3) runs only shard `i` of `N`: the gates
whose position in the SORTED derived set is `i-1` modulo `N`. The slice is a
function of the gate names alone, so the N shards of one side are disjoint and
their union is the whole set; unset, or `1/1`, is the whole set, as before.
The workflow gives each shard its own machine and checkout, so shards never
race; within a shard, `GATE_JOBS` > 1 runs gates side by side, and a gate whose
script holds the whole tree for its run (`TREE_TOOLS`: publish-check.ts hashes it
around its writer, the standalone probes copy it or `git init` inside it), or
runs a script that does (`skill:register:check` runs `subgraph:jsonld:check`),
runs alone after the pool drains, so a neighbour's write is never blamed on it. The skipped gates and the
`--record`ed results go in shard 1 only, so a merged side holds each once.
Beside <out.json> the run writes `gates-shard.json` -- the shard, `N`, the size
of the whole set, and the names it ran -- from which the compare job proves
every shard is present and that together they cover the set
(`merge-shards.py`). A malformed `GATE_SHARD` exits 2: guessing a slice could
silently drop gates. `--list` honours it too, and adds a `shard` field.

`--record <file.json>` merges results a workflow step already produced, in the
same shape (`{name: {command, exit, tail}}`, or `{name: {command, skipped}}`),
into <out.json>: the `derive:publish` build that runs before the gates is
judged by the compare job like one of them, so a build the PR breaks is a NEW
failure rather than a line in a log. A missing or unreadable file records the
step as `exit 2` ("could not determine"), never as nothing.

A declared gate that cannot determine anything here is not run, and is
written with a `skipped` reason in place of `exit` (owner, 2026-10-15, "b1"):
one that judges the remote's live state (`LIVE_STATE_SCRIPTS`), and one that
needs an argument or artefact this runner never supplies (`NEEDS_INPUT_SCRIPTS`).

A gate whose input this runner DOES have is given it instead
(`SUPPLIED_INPUTS`): `check:corpus-gate` gets `--since $GATE_DIFF_BASE`, the
PR's diff base, `translation:catalogue:check` gets `--base` the same commit,
and `check:test-budgets` the junit report at `$GATE_JUNIT`
that the tests step wrote. Either is skipped, with its reason, only on a side
that holds no such input.

`GATE_CONE` wires in the CI cone (`scripts/ci-cone.ts`, bean `4rbc`;
cat-harness-tools#398). Unset, nothing changes. Every declared gate run as
exactly `bun run cat <script>` is asked about, in one `ci-cone.ts decide-all`,
before any gate runs:

- `skip` (a pull request): a gate whose read set, recorded by a green traced
  run on the caller's main, is unchanged here (every path's state, every
  replayed git answer, and the script's `f017` fingerprint) is NOT run. It is
  written with `skipped: "inputs unchanged since <sha> ..."` and
  `unchanged: <sha>`, never an `exit`, so it can never read as a pass.
- `record` (a push to the caller's main): the same, and then every candidate
  that did not skip runs under `strace` by `ci-cone.ts run`, after every other
  gate: the pooled ones GATE_JOBS at once, a record a neighbour's writes may
  have met dropped and its gate run again alone (`run_traced`), the alone ones
  one at a time. The shard's
  records go to `cone-records.json` beside <out.json>. A gate that skipped
  keeps the record it matched, so main traces only what changed (bean `4rbc`,
  "a cheaper record on main").

Anything the cone cannot answer (no `ci-cone.ts` at this side's pin, no
record, no `strace`, a runner other than `bun run cat`, an error) runs the
gate, as without the cone. A skip also names the record's FOOTPRINT, the
top-level entries of the root its read set lies in, derived from the record and never
declared (owner, 2026-10-07: "derived is BEST"); a gate whose footprint is its
own instance's directory alone is reported as own-tree (cat-harness-tools#398,
2b). The footprint never skips a gate on its own: see `footprint`.

# neighbour's write would otherwise be stored as a state the gate never read.
# The other records are kept with `ci-cone.ts keep`, which stores them exactly
