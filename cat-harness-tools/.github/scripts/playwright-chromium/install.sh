# Install Playwright's Chromium and, only when some are missing, the system
# libraries it needs. ONE copy for every workflow and action that installs a
# browser (layer-pr-checks.yml, layer-post-merge-regen.yml, pr-tests.yml, the
# ci-setup action); they call this instead of
# `playwright install --with-deps chromium`.
#
# Usage: install.sh <playwright command...>
#   e.g. install.sh node_modules/.bin/playwright
#        install.sh npx --yes playwright
#
# Why (2026-11-11): from ~13:59Z runners could not resolve archive.ubuntu.com
# or security.ubuntu.com, and `--with-deps` ran `apt-get update && apt-get
# install` on EVERY run, so apt exited 100 and whole PR tiers failed before a
# test ran, although the runner image already carries every library Chromium
# needs. Three steps:
#
#   1. The browser itself, from Playwright's CDN (not apt). Always run; any
#      failure fails the step, as before.
#   2. `playwright install-deps --dry-run chromium`, which simulates the apt
#      install (`apt-get install -s`, no network) and prints "All system
#      dependencies are installed." and exits 0 only when nothing is missing.
#      Then apt is not touched at all. Any other answer (missing packages, an
#      older Playwright whose dry run only prints the command, a simulation
#      error) counts as "may be missing" and goes on to step 3: the check can
#      skip apt, never skip a needed install.
#   3. `playwright install-deps chromium` with apt retrying each fetch
#      (Acquire::Retries) and up to three attempts with back-off. If every
#      attempt fails the step fails: a missing library is a real failure.
