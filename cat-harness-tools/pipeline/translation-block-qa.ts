/**
 * Per-block translation QA sidecars — `<stem>.<locale>.translation-qa.json`.
 *
 * `translation-qa-sweep.ts` answers a different question: how much of the docs
 * SITE exists in each language. That is page coverage, and it is what the badge
 * under a page title reports. Nothing measured a BLOCK, so the per-block
 * translation icon had nothing to open — every block on the site reads
 * `TR ·`, honestly, because no such sidecar has ever existed.
 *
 * One sidecar per (block, locale), in the `block-qa/v1` entry shape so the
 * witness reader in `qa-witness.ts` serves both families without a second
 * projection to keep in step. Per locale rather than per block, mirroring
 * `translations/<locale>/`: a block translated into French and not into Arabic
 * has one verdict, not a merged one.
 *
 * ## What this can establish, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * Three criteria are deterministic, reproducible, and worth a script witness:
 *
 * | criterion | what it measures |
 * |---|---|
 * | `translation-coverage` | how many of the block's extracted strings carry a non-empty translation |
 * | `translation-terms-preserved` | acronyms, numbers and URLs that must survive translation, and did not |
 * | `translation-not-echo` | a "translation" byte-identical to its source — the untranslated passthrough |
 *
 * `translation-semantic-roundtrip` is declared **with no entry at all**, and
 * that is the point rather than an omission.
 *
 * A round trip asks whether the MEANING survived, by translating back with a
 * translator that has not seen the original. Nothing here can do that. The only
 * back-translation available offline is reversing the PO's own msgid→msgstr
 * map, which returns the source **exactly, always** — a similarity of 1.0 that
 * measures the lookup table, not the translation. A score computed that way
 * would be a verdict with a script's name on it and no content, which is worse
 * than the gap: a reader who sees a green round-trip stops asking.
 *
 * The page-level numbers that used to sit in `translations/fr/index.ts` showed
 * the shape of that error from the other side: `roundTripQA: { fail: 21,
 * total: 36, method: "jaccard-word-overlap" }`, scored against a
 * back-translation map holding 6 entries for 36 strings — so every string
 * nobody had back-translated came back at 0 similarity and was published as
 * drift, and the count was of absences. The field, those numbers and the two
 * scripts that wrote them are gone; there is nothing left to copy per block.
 *
 * So the criterion appears in the sidecar carrying no witness, and the panel
 * says "no witness recorded — nobody has ruled on it". When an LLM or a human
 * back-translates, their entry appends here as an `agent` or `human` witness
 * beside the script ones, which is what the shared shape is for. Bean `ktt2`.
 *
 * ## A block with no translation gets NO sidecar, not a failing one
 *
 * A resolved PO that contains none of a block's strings means the block has not
 * been translated — not that its translation is 0% complete. Writing `fail` there
 * would paint every untranslated block red on a site that is 3% translated, and
 * bury the blocks whose translation exists and is broken. Absence stays
 * absence: no sidecar, and the icon reads `TR ·` — not swept.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/pipeline/translation-block-qa.ts                 # write
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/pipeline/translation-block-qa.ts --check [--against <ref>]   # judge, write nothing
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/pipeline/translation-block-qa.ts --root <dir> --locales fr,es
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/pipeline/translation-block-qa.ts --catalogues [--instance <dir>] [--check]
 *
 * ## `--catalogues` and `--instance` — pages and glossaries with no block
 *
 * Blocks and the docs site's pages are measured against their SOURCE. An IG
 * page, a diagram or a glossary scheme is catalogued too, but has no block and
 * no page on this site, so nothing measured it and its round-trip verdicts
 * ended up in PR text. `--catalogues` adds a third pass: every
 * `<translations>/<locale>/<rel>.po` with its `.pot` beside it, in the
 * `translation-sources` directory the layer declares, not already measured
 * by a block or page verdict, is measured against the template with the same
 * criteria. Its sidecar is the same `translation-qa/v1` document, at
 * `translationQaPath` with the catalogue's path (locale removed) as subject,
 * under the layer's QA tree: `test/results/translation-qa/translations/<rel>.<locale>.translation-qa.json`.
 * `bun run cat translation:page-qa` runs it. The default run is unchanged.
 *
 * `--instance <dir>` sweeps the layer at `<dir>` instead of this one, by
 * its own declarations; the sidecars go into ITS QA tree.
 *
 * ## `--check` computes and judges (bean `oqe3`)
 *
 * It compared every fresh sidecar with the committed one and failed on
 * "stale". Once `translation-qa/` is stored on `qa-reports` (5hox) there is
 * no committed copy to be stale against, so `--check` now COMPUTES each
 * sidecar and fails on a `fail` verdict that is NEW against the baseline —
 * `--against <ref>` reads it from the branch; an inherited one is reported
 * and does not fail; a baseline that cannot be read is UNKNOWN, reported and
 * not gated (proposal §2.3). A pair whose attestations could not be read is
 * the run's own blind spot: exit 2. A stale derived sidecar is advisory in a
 * stored directory and still a finding in an unstored one.

 * Tokens that should survive a translation, in TWO classes of confidence.

 * ## Why the classes exist
 *
 * A URL or a number that changed is broken or false, in any language, with no
 * judgement required. An ACRONYM is a different thing entirely: a good
 * translation localises it. `WHO` is `OMS` in French and
 * `منظمة الصحة العالمية` in Arabic, and those are the organisation's name in
 * those languages, not a dropped term.
 *
 * Both were one list returning `fail` at `major` until bean `pp93` swept whole
 * docs pages for the first time and it fired on real translated prose. Measured
 * on `docs/index.md`: 4 locales `fail`, every finding an acronym the translator
 * had rendered correctly — `WHO` → `OMS`, `LLM` → `نموذج لغوي`, `HCI` expanded
 * in French. That would have shipped as the loudest thing on the most
 * translated page this site has, and a false verdict is worse than the silence
 * it replaces. It is the shape bean `ktt2` is about, arriving from the other
 * direction: a checker reporting what it did not measure.
 *
 * ## The fix is the severity, not the detection
 *
 * A missing acronym is still worth SEEING — a translator who silently dropped
 * `FHIR` from a sentence about FHIR has lost the term the sentence is about,
 * and that is exactly the class a fluent mistranslation passes. So it is still
 * reported, as a `warn` the reader is asked to judge, because the checker
 * genuinely cannot tell a correct localisation from a loss. `fail` is kept for
 * the class where it cannot be wrong.
 *
 * A glossary would settle the acronym case properly — `translations/<locale>/
 * glossary.po` already exists for exactly this kind of term — and that is worth
 * doing. Until then the criterion reports the confidence it actually has.

 * The terminology glossary for one locale — what a term is expected to become.

 * ## Why the checker needs one
 *

 * translation. It cannot see whether that is `OMS` (correct) or a silently
 * dropped term (a real loss), so it warns on both — four unactionable warns on
 * `docs/index.md` alone, on a page whose translations are fine. Bean `he0e`.
 *
 * ## What an entry says, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * `translations/<locale>/glossary.po`, the slot `schemas/content/translation.ts`
 * already declares ("shared glossary PO (no POT — hand-authored)"). Three
 * shapes, and the third is the one that matters:
 *
 * | entry | meaning | when the term is absent |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `msgstr "OMS"` | the expected form, pinned | **fail** — the glossary said what it should be |
 * | `msgstr "FHIR"` (identity) | must survive verbatim | **fail** |
 * | `#, localised` | rendered in the target language, form NOT pinned | **pass** — absence is the expected outcome |
 * | absent from the glossary | unknown | **warn**, as before |
 *
 * **The third shape is why this needs no translated content.** Pinning forms
 * would mean authoring the Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Spanish and French of
 * every term — target-language material invented to quieten a checker, in a
 * repository whose first rule is that it holds no content. `#, localised` says
 * the one thing the checker actually needs and the one thing a reader of
 * English can review: *this term gets localised; I am not pinning how*. A folio
 * that wants the stricter check pins the form, and gets it.
 *
 * ## It cannot become a mute button
 *
 * A flag that made a criterion pass unconditionally would be a defect wearing a
 * glossary's clothes. `localised` only ever converts a would-be finding about
 * THAT term into a pass; it cannot suppress `strict` tokens (URLs, numbers),
 * cannot act on a term it does not name, and every locale's glossary is read
 * separately, so marking a term in French says nothing about Arabic.

 * `docs/index.md`. One phrase appears on both pages, so the match was not
 * empty — it was 1 of 66 strings, and the sweep was about to publish five
 * locales of `translation-coverage: fail, 2%` about a page nobody has ever
 * translated. A false verdict is worse than the silence it replaces, and this
 * one would have been the loudest thing on the page.
 *
 * ## The PO already says, so this asks rather than infers
 *
 * gettext `#:` reference lines name the source each msgid came from, and
 * `parsePoEntries` keeps them. Three spellings are live in this corpus and all
 * three are accepted, because the reference is written by whatever produced the
 * POT and this module does not get to dictate that:
 *
 *   - `docs/index.md` — instance-relative, no line;
 *   - `docs/source/process-crdm-methodology/overview.md:1` — instance-relative, line;
 *   - `agent-onboarding.md:10` — bare basename, line.
 *
 * So the line suffix is stripped, and then the reference's OWN SHAPE decides
 * how it is matched. A reference carrying a directory is a path and must match
 * the subject's instance-relative path exactly; only a bare basename, which
 * names no directory and cannot be resolved to one, falls back to matching on
 * basename.
 *
 * **That distinction is the whole fix, and matching on basename either way
 * fails.** `docs/index.md` and `docs/cat-harness/index.md` share the basename
 * `index.md`, so a basename-tolerant rule re-admits the exact collision above
 * — measured: it did, and the sweep still wrote five false `fail` sidecars
 * until the shape test replaced it.
 *
 * **That PARTICULAR pair no longer exists, and the rule is not weakened by
 * it.** `docs/cat-harness/index.md` moved on 2026-09-21 (bean `8h42`): the
 * authored page went to `docs/platform.md` and the generated page that took
 * its route is `published-graphs.md`, carrying `permalink: /cat-harness/`, so
 * there is one `index` stem in the site again. A reader checking the example
 * will not find the file — which is why this says so, rather than leaving a
 * defence that looks like it guards against nothing. Any two same-stem pages
 * reproduce it, and the next pair will not be announced.
 *
 * ## A PO with NO references is accepted, deliberately
 *
 * A hand-authored `glossary.po` carries no `#:` lines at all — `translation.ts`
 * documents it as having no POT because nobody extracted it. Rejecting those
 * would drop every shared glossary from every verdict. Absent references mean
 * "this PO does not say", which is not the same as "this PO says no", and only
 * the second is a reason to skip.

 *
 * A `WebPage` assembled from block triples has its translation measured per
 * block, and the page-level icon rolls those up. A HAND-AUTHORED page has no
 * blocks, so nothing measured it — and those are precisely the pages this site
 * actually has translations of. `docs/index.md` is translated into all five
 * target locales and carried no translation verdict anywhere. Bean `pp93`.
 *
 * ## Three exclusions, and each would be a wrong answer rather than a gap
 *
 * 1. **A GENERATED page.** `docs/process/crdm-methodology.md` is assembled from blocks
 *    that carry their own translation verdicts, so sweeping the assembled page
 *    as well would measure the same prose twice and roll it up twice — a page
 *    reporting eight criteria where four were established. Detected by the
 *    marker `gen-docs-pages.ts` writes into its own output, which is what bean
 *    `06e3` §4(b) added it for: before that marker a generated page was
 *    byte-indistinguishable from an authored one and this question had no
 *    answer.
 * 2. **A TRANSLATED page.** `docs/fr/index.md` is the OUTPUT of the translation
 *    whose quality is in question. Extracting its French prose and looking it
 *    up in a source→target PO finds nothing, so it would be reported as "not
 *    translated" — of the page that IS the translation. It is recognised by its
 *    own `lang`, never by its path: a folio with a `no/` chapter (Norwegian, or
 *    the English word) is the failure `translation-index.ts` documents at
 *    length, and this module is not going to reintroduce it one directory over.
 * 3. **Jekyll's own machinery** — `_data`, `_includes`, `_site`, `assets`,
 *    `vendor`. A leading underscore is Jekyll's convention, not a guess about
