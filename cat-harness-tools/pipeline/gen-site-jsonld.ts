/**
 * Emit the docs site's own JSON-LD graph from `docs/source/`.
 *
 * STRAWPERSON — a first cut, deliberately. The shape here (page node ->
 * ordered `contains` -> one node per child) mirrors `gen-library-jsonld.ts`
 * because that is the model already proven across 576 ingested documents, but
 * every choice below is open to revision: which vocabulary a page node takes,
 * whether an asset's `@id` should be the asset or the section presenting it,
 * and whether the site graph belongs in the same index as the corpus at all.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE GENERATOR, not a widening of `gen-block-jsonld.ts`.
 *
 * That generator walks `content/<paper>/` and REFUSES when it finds nothing:
 * "folio-assistant is the platform; papers live in the folio repo." That
 * refusal is load-bearing — `scripts/tests/audit-empty-corpus.test.ts`
 * enforces the same invariant from the audit side. The docs live under
 * `docs/source/`, which both `gen-block-jsonld.ts` and the section-title
 * audit skip when walking paper directories — keeping the two populations
 * (folio content vs platform documentation) apart without an out-of-tree
 * `site-content/` workaround.
 *
 * So the site gets its own emitter, its own IRI space (`site/<slug>`), and its
 * own gate. It shares the published `@context` and the `folio:` / `doco:`
 * vocabulary, which is what makes the two graphs joinable later if that turns
 * out to be wanted.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT DONE YET, and should not be assumed:
 *   - nothing loads these into `graph-index.ts`, so `corpus_search` cannot see
 *     them. Emitting the nodes and indexing them are separate steps and only
 *     the first is here.
 *   - `uses` / `cites` edges are not extracted from the narrative. A page's
 *     cross-links are plain markdown today; turning them into typed edges is
 *     the obvious next increment and is where the graph starts earning its
 *     keep.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/pipeline/gen-site-jsonld.ts            # write
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/pipeline/gen-site-jsonld.ts --check    # CI gate
 *
 * @covers docs
