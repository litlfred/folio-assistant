/**
 * The ingest writer — Stage A/B artefacts become graph nodes.
 *
 * `pdf-structure.py` produces `structure.json` + `sections/*.md`, and
 * `extract-candidates.py` produces `candidates.json`. Both are flat. This
 * turns them into the same kind of graph the authored side emits, so one
 * loader, one `@context` and one QA sweep serve both populations.
 *
 * ```
 * library/<doc-id>/
 *   structure.json          Stage A  (input)
 *   sections/<sid>.md       Stage A  (input, and the prose block's text)
 *   candidates.json         Stage B  (input)
 *   manifest.jsonld         ← document node, ordered contains → sections
 *   sections/<sid>.jsonld   ← grouping node, ordered contains → blocks
 *   blocks/<bid>.jsonld     ← content blocks
 *   blocks/<bid>.md         ← an extracted claim's text
 * ```
 *
 * ## A tabular entry is a second rung, not the same one with holes
 *
 * A tabular entry carries its tabular record and no Stage A output at all.
 * It gets its own branch (`pipeline/tabular-nodes.ts`, bean `p67i`)
 * rather than a parameterised `buildDocumentNodes`, because the shapes differ
 * where it matters: a workbook's grouping node is a *sheet*, and a CSV has no
 * grouping node whatsoever — its tables hang off the manifest, because the
 * source genuinely has no sheets (`jg8s`).
 *
 * ```
 * library/<doc-id>/
 *   tabular.jsonld          (input — or tabular.csvw.json, once eief lands)
 *   manifest.jsonld         ← contains → sheets, OR → blocks for a CSV
 *   sheets/<key>.jsonld     ← grouping node, workbook only
 *   blocks/table-NNN.jsonld ← one per sheet, carrying the header vocabulary
 * ```
 *
 * ## Blocks own the files; a section is a manifest
 *
 * A section node carries no text. Its `contains` is an **ordered** list of
 * block ids, exactly as a chapter holds sections and a section holds
 * `blocks[]` on the authored side. The section's prose becomes one `prose`
 * block whose `text` points at the *existing* `sections/<sid>.md` — no copy,
 * so the 24.7 M extracted characters stay exactly where the corpus-grep
 * checklist already looks for them.
 *
 * Extraction is therefore incremental rather than all-or-nothing: whatever
 * Stage B recognises becomes a typed block, and the rest stays in the prose
 * block. As extractors improve, prose shrinks and typed blocks multiply,
 * without the section's identity or its `@id` changing.
 *
 * ## These nodes are NOT folio content
 *
 * `candidates.json` says so itself — *"proposals only … nothing here is folio
 * content and nothing here creates Lean"* — and the graph must not blur it.
 * Every node here carries `provenance: "ingested"` and is attributed to its
 * source document, so a query can always separate *what this paper claims*
 * from *what the folio claims*. Promotion into `content/` stays the separate,
 * deliberate act that `document-intake` Stage 4 describes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/pipeline/gen-library-jsonld.ts
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/pipeline/gen-library-jsonld.ts --check
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/pipeline/gen-library-jsonld.ts --doc <doc-id>
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/pipeline/gen-library-jsonld.ts --entry <entry-dir>
 *   (any other argument is refused, and nothing is written)
 *
 * @module pipeline/gen-library-jsonld
 * @covers library, uploads
