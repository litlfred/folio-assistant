/**
 * Glossary consistency of an instance's translations, against a term base
 * merged from the glossaries of the layers it mounts.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-11-06, for the translation watcher: the layered glossaries
 * provide precedence for fixed translation terms. The rules are ported from
 * the instance-side `tools/translation/glossary_qa.py` (smart-trust-demo #54,
 * by the EN translation team) and made generic: every path comes from a
 * declaration, and no instance is named here.
 *
 * ## The term base, and which layer wins
 *
 * A term's translation in a locale is FIXED by the first glossary that
 * translates it, in this order:
 *
 * 1. reference glossaries named with `--layer <name>=<pattern>` (normative
 *    content, such as a WHO glossary, outranks the platform);
 * 2. the layers of the instance's `needs` chain, deepest (most authoritative)
 *    first — `declarationChain`, the order every layered reader here uses;
 * 3. the instance's own glossaries, last: they may ADD terms, never change one.
 *
 * In each layer the glossaries are its declared `translation-sources`
 * directory's `<locale>/glossary/<owner>--<scheme>.po` (the per-scheme
 * catalogues `glossary:pot` writes) and `<locale>/glossary.po` (the
 * hand-authored terminology file). A scheme catalogue is ranked by the layer
 * that OWNS the scheme (its `<owner>--` prefix), not by the layer that hosts
 * the file: cat-harness hosts bootstrap's terms, and bootstrap is the lower
 * layer.
 *
 * What fixes a term: a label (a scheme entry whose `#.` comment says "Glossary
 * term label" or "alternative label"; in `glossary.po`, any short entry that is
 * not a sentence) under 60 characters, with a non-empty msgstr, not marked
 * `#, localised` (which says the term is localised, not how) and not fuzzy.
 *
 * ## Scope: a fixed term binds only within its subject area
 *
 * The platform's terms (bootstrap's Reference, Actor, Skill; cat-harness's
 * policy) carry no sense of their own, so applying them as fixed translations
 * to health content gives wrong answers — FHIR `Reference(...)`, IHE "actors",
 * health "policy" (政策, not the harness's 策略). The owner chose "scoped fixed
 * terms" (`folio-glossary/v1`, 2026-11-07): a scheme, or a
 * term, declares the subject area its translations bind in (`subject`,
 * `dcterms:subject`); a term's own overrides its scheme's; with neither, the
 * term binds only in its own scheme (`<instance>--<scheme id>`). Only
 * `authored` terms fix anything. `scopeNote` is prose and is never compared.
 * The glossary is read as data from the file each scheme catalogue's `#:`
 * names, since its schema belongs to a layer above this one.
 *
 * Precedence applies within one subject area. A term binds the instance's
 * catalogues when its area is one of the instance's own (its glossaries'
 * subjects and schemes, its terminology file), or it came from a `--layer`
 * reference glossary, whose area is every area.
 *
 * ## In sense: by rule, then by an adjudicator
 *
 * Owner, 2026-11-07: "If a glossary term is used in the narrative in the
 * correct context, then the glossary translation is used in the translated
 * narrative." Each use of a fixed term in a msgid is one of:
 *
 * - **in sense by rule**: the term binds here (above), so the catalogue's
 *   subject area is the term's. Its fixed translation is enforced.
 * - **pending**: a term of another area. Undecided until an untainted
 *   adjudicator agent, given the term, its definition and the sentence, rules
 *   `in-sense`, `other-sense` or `exception` (`--pending --json` lists what
 *   to ask, `--record <file>` stores the answers). Listed; fails nothing.
 * - **adjudicated**: `in-sense` is enforced, `other-sense` checks nothing,
 *   `exception` ("in sense, but the fixed term is wrong here because …")
 *   passes and is listed. An `exception` also passes a use in sense by rule.
 *
 * Verdicts are stored in the instance, `<translation-sources>/glossary-sense.json`
 * (`schemas/kg/glossary-sense.ts`), keyed by the term's id and the msgid's
 * SHA-256: sense is a property of the English, so one verdict serves every
 * locale, and a changed msgid is asked again. This script never asks a model;
 * the adjudication is an agent's, outside it.
 *
 * A use whose msgstr renders the fixed translation needs no verdict. Keeping
 * the English term verbatim counts as rendering it only where the term is part
 * of a code or resource name: the term and a name-shaped neighbour (Capitalised,
 * ALL-CAPS, or an identifier such as `Provenance.agent`) kept together, as
 * written, in the msgstr — "WHO SMART Trust" left as the product's name. The
 * term kept alone, in prose, is not a rendering.
 *
 * ## What is flagged, per locale
 *
 * - `not-fixed-rendering`: a msgid uses a fixed term IN SENSE (by rule or by
 *   verdict; prefLabel or altLabel; whole word; case-insensitive, except a
 *   short all-caps acronym) and its msgstr does not use the term's fixed
 *   translation. Matching is by word stem (ru, ar, fr, es) or substring (zh,
 *   ar), as the prior art did.
 * - `inconsistent`: a term that two or more of the instance's entries — whose
 *   whole msgid is the term — render differently in one locale.
 * - `override`: a second, different translation of a fixed term in the SAME
 *   subject area (or of a reference glossary's term). The instance translating
 *   another area's label otherwise is a sense check.
 *
 * Exit: 0 clean, 1 on findings, 2 when it cannot determine (no declared
 * `translation-sources`, an unknown locale). Without `--check` the result is
 * also written as `glossary-consistency.qa-results.json` (`qa-results/v1`, one
 * family per locale) in the instance's QA directory, where `kg-qa-report`
 * reads it into its "Glossary consistency" section.
 *
 * A use pending adjudication, or ruled `other-sense` or `exception`, never
 * changes the exit code.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat translation:glossary:check --instance <dir> --locale fr [--layer who=<dir>/{locale}/*.po]
 *   bun run cat translation:glossary:check --instance <dir> --all-locales
 *   bun run cat translation:glossary --instance <dir>        # every locale; writes the record
 *   bun run cat translation:glossary:check --instance <dir> --pending --json   # what the adjudicator is asked
 *   bun run cat translation:glossary:check --instance <dir> --record <verdicts.json>
 *
 * @module pipeline/translation-glossary
 * @covers translation-sources, qa
