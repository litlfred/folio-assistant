/**
 * The emitters' write boundary for per-instance JSON-LD contexts — bean
 * `folio-assistant-63q4`, owner 2026-10-15: an emitted document names
 * `<iriBase>ns/context/v1.jsonld`, the context of the instance its file sits
 * in, in place of the shared `ns/content/v1.jsonld`.
 *
 * ## Why this is here and not only in cat-harness
 *
 * cat-harness#257 adds the same rule to `schemas/content/content-context.ts`
 * (`instanceContext`, `instanceDocumentContext`, `atInstanceContext`). This
 * layer's checks run against cat-harness `main`, which does not have it yet,
 * so the emitters importing it could not typecheck until that merged. The
 * rule is three lines, and the duplicate is deliberate and temporary: once
 * cat-harness#257 is on the pin, the emitters import from there and this
 * module goes. `instance-document-context.test.ts` pins the two to the same
 * answers in the meantime by testing the same cases.
 *
 * @module pipeline/instance-document-context
