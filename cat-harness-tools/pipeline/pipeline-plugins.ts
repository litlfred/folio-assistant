/**
 * The slots through which GENERIC pipeline code reaches a higher layer's code.
 *
 * ## Why (bean `squu`, owner ruling 2026-10-01 ~18:15)
 *
 * The sci-bound pipeline files — the Lean lexer, the LaTeX preflight, Lean
 * coverage, one folio's chapter profiles — go straight to the science layer,
 * the top layer. A generic module that imports one of them would, after that
 * move, be a lower → higher import, which `check:import-direction` rejects.
 * So the generic caller asks for a KIND here and the science layer fills it
 * through the `pipeline-plugins` graph it declares (one node per slot).
 * Neither side names the other's files: the edge is inverted, not hidden.
 *
 * ## The shape is the one the repository already uses
 *
 * A slot is a {@link PipelinePluginContribution} on {@link ContributionRegistry},
 * loaded by the same dependency walk as content adapters, QA checkers, render
 * targets and MCP tools (`schemas/content/contributions.ts`). A kind claimed by two
 * contributors THROWS — the `contributions.ts` rule, kept for the reason it was
 * made: which Lean lexer runs must not depend on the order dependencies are
 * listed in.
 *
 * ## Why the registry is held here, and filled lazily
 *
 * `ContributionRegistry` is deliberately an instance, not module state. The
 * callers here are synchronous and deep — a checker in the sweep's hot loop, a
 * module-load side effect, a build step — and threading a registry through
 * each would change the signatures the QA dispatch tables are keyed on. So
 * this module holds ONE registry for the process, filled on first use from the
 * running folio's declared dependencies (`loadContributionsSync` from
 * `contributionsRoot()`), and a test or a caller that has already loaded one
 * hands it over with {@link usePipelinePluginRegistry}.
 *
 * Lazy is what keeps behaviour identical: every entry point that imported a
 * leaf directly — the sweep, the build, `q-usage-audit`, a test — reaches the
 * same function through the slot with no new setup step to forget.
 *
 * ## An unfilled slot is an error that says what is missing
 *
 * {@link pipelinePlugin} throws {@link UnregisteredPipelinePluginError}, naming
 * the kind, the root whose dependencies were walked, and which slots WERE
 * filled. It is never defaulted: a Lean lexer that silently does nothing would
 * make every Lean-sibling check pass. A caller for whom absence is a real,
 * reportable state uses {@link optionalPipelinePlugin} and says so.
