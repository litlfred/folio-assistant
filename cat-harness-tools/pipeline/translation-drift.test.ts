/**
 * A published translation that has drifted from its source — bean `07p7`.
 *
 * ## The measurement this suite exists because of
 *
 * The first pass at this bean reported five faithful translations as five
 * headings adrift from their source, and I nearly shipped it as the headline.
 * The count came from `grep -c '^#'`, which counts the `#` COMMENT lines in a
 * page's YAML front matter as headings. Strip the front matter and all five
 * match exactly.
 *
 * So the front-matter strip is the first thing tested, with a fixture whose
 * front matter carries more `#` lines than the body has headings. A checker
 * that gets this wrong does not fail quietly: it reports every translation in
 * the corpus as broken, which is the fastest way to have a gate switched off.
 *
