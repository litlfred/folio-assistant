/**
 * Where a library entry's title comes from: ONE resolver, one order.
 *
 * @module pipeline/library-title
 * @covers library
 *
 * Issue #1794, bean `8iqc`. Owner's ruling of 2026-10-01 (option 2 of 4):
 *
 * > title authority order = catalogue record (IRIS Dublin Core) →
 * > `referenced.json` → PDF Info `/Title` → slug. NEVER use the page-1
 * > front-matter parse as a title.
 *
 * ## Why the page-1 parse is out, not just demoted
 *
 * `pdf-structure.py`'s `parse_front_matter` reads the first non-furniture lines
 * of page 1. It is a heuristic that guesses which lines are the title, and on
 * this corpus it guessed *"Abies"* for a 1993 scan whose catalogue record says
 * *"WHO editorial style manual"*. It also guessed *"LeanArchitect
 * LeanArchitect"*, *"Algorithmic Approaches to"*, and titles that ran on into
 * the authors or the W3C status block. A slug is honest about being a
 * placeholder, and `check:library-qa` flags it as `title-missing`. A plausible
 * wrong title passes every check that does not hold a second source. So the
 * parse may still feed other uses (the section files' `doc_title`, search),
 * but nothing here reads `metadata.title` from a PDF structure.
 *
 * ## The one slot the ruling did not name: `text-heading`
 *
 * The four sources assume a PDF. A `text-structure/v1` or
 * `notebook-structure/v1` entry, ingested from Markdown, a spec repository or
 * a notebook, has no Info dictionary. Its `metadata.title` is the format's
 * own declared title: a front-matter `title:` field, an explicit `--title`,
 * or the level-1 heading the author marked as the title. That is the same
 * kind of fact as `/Title` (the source's own metadata) and not a guess about
 * which lines on a page are the title. It takes the `pdf-info` rank. The two
 * are exclusive by variant, so no entry ever has both.
 *
 * ## The junk filter
 *
 * `/Title` is filled by whatever program wrote the PDF, and many write the
 * file they were saving. {@link pdfInfoTitleJunk} refuses those, and the
 * resolver then falls through to the slug. The same filter applies to a
 * `text-heading`, whose writer falls back to the file name or the slug when
 * the source declares nothing. A junk `/Title` therefore reads as
 * "no title" rather than as a wrong title.
 *
 * ## Two slots from bean `w6fu` (owner's ruling of 2026-10-02 on #1838)
 *
 * Ruling 3 of #1838 came a day after #1794's: *first improve the code that
 * extracts titles from PDFs, then fix whatever it still gets wrong as data,
 * one entry at a time.* It produced two things a `pdf-structure/v1` entry can
 * now carry, and each takes a slot here without reopening #1794:
 *
 * - `editorial` — `metadata.title_correction.title`, an editor's record made
 *   for one entry with its `basis`. It is the TOP of the order: it is data a
 *   person wrote after looking, which is what the catalogue record is too,
 *   only closer to the entry. Taken as written, like the other records.
 * - `corroborated` — `metadata.title` ONLY when `metadata.title_verified` is
 *   `true`, i.e. `_pdf_title.py` found an independent source agreeing with it.
 *   It ranks below `/Title` and `text-heading` and above the slug. An
 *   UNVERIFIED `metadata.title` is still the page-1 guess #1794 excludes, and
 *   is never read. The junk filter applies, as to every machine-read source.
