/**
 * Every declared `tools` graph's Tool nodes, found by asking the declarations.
 *
 * @module cat-harness-tools/tools/discover
 *
 * Every directory an instance declares with graph typology `tools` is loaded,
 * and its `tools()` export merged. A static barrel could not do this: the
 * harness may not import an instance that depends on it (`check:partition`).
 *
 * ## No import edge
 *
 * The module specifier is a variable read from a declaration, as in
 * `qa-checker-discovery.ts`. `repo-partition` counts a literal `import("./x")`
 * as an edge and a variable one as none: the edge exists exactly when the
 * target is hardcoded.
 *
 * ## Broken Tools fail the gate, not the call
 *
 * `check:tools`, in the gate set, runs this discovery: a declared `tools`
 * module that does not load, exports no `tools()`, or yields a Tool that fails
 * its schema is a reported {@link ToolDiscovery.failures | failure}, and the
 * gate fails on it.
 *
 * ## Failures are never "no tools"
 *
 * A declared graph whose module is missing or throws is a failure with a
 * reason, never an empty list, so "could not be loaded" never reads as "has
 * no Tools".
