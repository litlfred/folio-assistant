/**
 * Which checkout holds this instance, and whether it is the AGGREGATE.
 *
 * ## Why a test needs to ask (bean `ho66`)
 *
 * cat-harness is rehearsed as the repository it will be once separated: its
 * tracked files, and its declared closure's, laid out as sibling clones with
 * nothing above them (`probeStandalone` in `cat-harness-tools/scripts/seed-ready.ts`).
 * A handful of tests read what only the aggregate checkout holds — the bean
 * store and the todo graph at its root, another instance's tree, or a
 * committed output that was generated with the higher instances present.
 * Run alone, they fail on a missing input rather than on a defect, and that
 * failure looks exactly like a regression.
 *
 * The owner's ruling (2026-10-05) was to skip or guard those reads in a
 * principled way. This is the guard, and it is ONE predicate so that "needs
 * the aggregate" means the same thing at every call site.
 *
 * ## Derived, never configured
 *
 * The answer comes from the filesystem and the declarations — git's own
 * toplevel, and whether that toplevel holds instances other than this one —
 * never from an environment variable or a hardcoded path. A switch somebody
 * sets is a switch somebody forgets, and then the test is skipped in the one
 * checkout where it can run.
 *
 * git rather than `checkoutRootFor`, because two of the tests that use this
 * are tests OF `checkoutRootFor`: an oracle computed by the function under
 * test can only agree with it.
 *
 * ## A skip, visibly
 *
 * Callers use `test.skipIf(!inAggregate())`, or {@link notApplicableAlone}
 * where the skip should name what is absent, so a standalone run REPORTS the
 * skip rather than counting a pass; in the aggregate every guarded test runs
 * exactly as before. A test that reads a BUILT site file — one the publish
 * build writes and `.gitignore` keeps out of every clone — uses
 * {@link siteNotBuilt}, which skips only when that file is actually absent. A test whose subject can be found in cat-harness's own
 * content is rewritten to read that instead, and does not use this at all.
 *
