/**
 * The viewer Tools' `renders` declarations, grounded against the HARNESS
 * declarations (owner, 2026-10-09: *"Need harness to declare visualizer is
 * renderedBy"*).
 *
 * A Tool's `renders` is what it CAN draw; a harness's `visualisers` say what
 * it DOES, each `renderedBy` one Tool. So the two are checked against each
 * other: every visualiser names a Tool that exists, every Tool a visualiser
 * names renders something, and every rendered kind is declared somewhere.
 * `check:visualiser-routes` is the gate over the same facts; this pins them in
 * the test set the checkout runs.
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/viewer-tools.test.ts` to the
 * checkout's own test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`): it reads every layer's
 * declaration, which only the whole checkout holds.
