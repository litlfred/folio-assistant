 * `instance-repositories` tests about the WHOLE CHECKOUT, moved here from

 * checkout stages and the repository each declares, which only the checkout
 * holds. Standing alone, cat-harness has none of it, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer. The rest
 * of that file's tests stay there; every path here is composed from
 * ORIGIN_DIR, the directory they were written in, so nothing they read
