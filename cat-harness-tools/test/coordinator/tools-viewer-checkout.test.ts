   * A CHECK THAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY — so it is not built a third time.
   *
   * While fixing this defect I recorded a hypothesis on bean `yunp`: *"a `docs`
   * page shared by two entries whose graph typologies are disjoint is at least
   * suspicious, and that is computable."* It was written as the weaker,
   * mechanisable form of "is this page about this graph".
   *
   * IT WAS BUILT AND THE CORPUS FALSIFIED IT IMMEDIATELY. Three hits, all
   * legitimate:
   *
   * | page | shared by | why it is fine |
   * |---|---|---|
   * | `beans-and-todos.md` | `beans`, `todos` | one page about both, and its name says so |
   * | `document-ingestion.md` | `uploads`, `library` | the two ends of one process |
   * | `subgraph-viewers.md` | `schemas`, `library` | a page about the viewer mechanism itself |
   *
   * Three of three false positives — and it would not have caught the defect
   * it was written for either, because `skills.md` was never another entry's
   * DECLARED docs. `tools` pointed at a page that merely describes skills.
   *
   * So "disjoint graph typologies" does not imply "unrelated subjects", and a check
   * that fires only on legitimate cases is worse than none: it trains a reader
   * to skip it. The guard that does work is the vocabulary approximation
   * below, which is honest about approximating.
