/**
 * This repository's content root and its instance config AGREE — bean `zkgs`.
 *
 * @module test/repo-config-agreement
 * @graphNode none — a test
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `findContentRepoRoot()` stopped at `cat-harness/` while the config sat one
 * level up under another name, so `readDeclaredFolioProfile()` answered the
 * third state ("undetermined") from anywhere in this checkout. Every
 * `profiles: ["paper"]` criterion then ran on workflow documentation, and no
 * optional QA axis could be opted into here at all. Neither half was wrong on
 * its own; nothing asserted they MET. The resolver answered with a plausible
 * path rather than a fault — which is why it survived.
 *
 * It was fixed incidentally, by per-instance config names
 * (`<instance>.config.json`) and a resolver that walks outward from the
 * instance root. This test is the part that was missing: it runs the REAL
 * resolution on the REAL repository, not a fixture, so the next rename that
 * separates them fails here instead of silently re-scoping QA.
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/repo-config-agreement.test.ts` to
 * the checkout's own test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06
 * "Top-level instance"): every test in it reads the aggregate root's config
 * and declaration, which only the whole checkout holds. Standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it, and `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects
 * every test in that layer. Paths are composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory
 * it was written in, so nothing it reads changed.

/**

 * `<name>.config.json` FILE at the end of an outward walk. Since the split the
 * checkout root carries `index.config.json` (`folio-index-config/v1`), whose
 * per-instance ENTRIES are the config, and the per-instance files are gone
 * (the owner's 3d4caf6 removed the root's; cat-harness carries none). Every
 * config reader now goes through `readEffectiveConfig` -- the index entry
 * first, then the file (cat-harness#19). So "the content root and its config
 * agree" is asked of that reader: it must find the entry (`state: "ok"`, `via:
 * "index"`, `from` naming it), and the two consumers the `zkgs` defect broke
 * -- the declared profile and the optional axes -- must read the same answer.
 * The defect this pins is unchanged: a resolver that answers with a plausible
 * place rather than the config fails here.
