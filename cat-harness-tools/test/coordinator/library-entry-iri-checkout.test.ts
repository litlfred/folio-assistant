 * ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level instance"): each reads the library entries of
 * smart-base, smart-trust and fhir-harness, which only the checkout holds.
 * Standing alone, cat-harness has none of it, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer. The rest
 * of that file's tests stay there; every path here is composed from
 * ORIGIN_DIR, the directory they were written in, so nothing they read
 * changed.
