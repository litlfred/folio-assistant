    // the declaration.

    // declared, so that auditing this instance produces a committed verdict
    // rather than nothing — 13 instances had no `test/results` at all, which

    // 2026-09-26 rather than about the declaration.
    // ELEVEN since 2026-10-01: `schemas` joined when who-iris took its own
    // source descriptor (`sources/`) and generated lookup (`id-lookup/`, kind
    // `code`) from large-datasets (bean `j7ql`); `glossary` and `voices` joined

    // glossary in who-iris.json. Same reason as both above.
    // TWELVE since 2026-10-09: `tools` joined when who-iris declared its own
    // Tool node (`iris-pages`), the one its catalogue visualiser is
    // `renderedBy` (owner: "Need harness to declare visualizer is renderedBy").

    // repository health report (`test/health/results/`; owner, 2026-10-10:

    // lanes bind (folio-assistant#2781). Same reason again.
