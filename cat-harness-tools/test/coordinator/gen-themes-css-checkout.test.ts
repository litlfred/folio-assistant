/**
 * `gen-themes-css` tests about the WHOLE CHECKOUT, moved here from
 * `cat-harness-tools/scripts/tests/ui/gen-themes-css.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`, owner
 * ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level instance"): each reads every instance's sticky
 * themes, which only the checkout holds. Standing alone, cat-harness has none
 * of it, and `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer.
 * The rest of that file's tests stay there; every path here is composed from
 * ORIGIN_DIR, the directory they were written in, so nothing they read
 * changed.
 *
 * The stylesheet is BUILT AT PUBLISH since litlfred/cat-harness#371, so it is
 * built here when the checkout does not have it (`ensureThemesCss`), as
 * `todos-repo-root.test.ts` builds `todos/index.md`; a generator that cannot
 * run here is not itself a failure, and the tests below then fail on the
 * missing file under their own names.
