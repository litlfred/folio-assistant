/**
 * Each writer regen runs REPAIRS its check — measured on a staled artefact.
 *
 * Bean `i1q7`. `regen-after-merge.test.ts` asserts the PAIRING: that a check
 * names a writer that exists. That is the assertion that passed while
 * `translate-bpmn:bootstrap` printed "Nothing to do" and wrote nothing, so the
 * pairing was right by name and wrong in effect. This file asserts the effect:
 * stale one artefact on purpose, confirm the check goes red, let regen's own
 * pass run the writer it pairs from `package.json`, and confirm the check goes
 * green. Every artefact is restored to its exact bytes afterwards, so the test
 * leaves the tree as it found it (the gate runner's mutation guard checks).
 *
 * ## Why these pairs and not all of them
 *
 * Running every one of the ~90 writers over a staled fixture is a full regen
 * (5–6 minutes), and most writers have no single artefact a test can stale
 * without knowing the generator. These are the pairs MEASURED broken under
 * regen on 2026-10-01 — each one a merge where `bun run cat regen` left a gate red
 * and a person ran the writer by hand — plus the root `translate-bpmn` pair as
 * the control the bootstrap one should have matched. The class-wide guard is
 * the runtime one: a writer that exits non-zero is reported `writer-failed` by
 * regen itself, for every pair, rather than read as a real defect.
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/regen-writers.test.ts` to the
 * checkout's own test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06
 * "Top-level instance"): every test in it runs the checkout's real regen
 * writers, whose artefacts span instances (`bat:sync` wraps scripts in
 * folio-assistant-sci and the root `.claude/`), which only the whole checkout
 * holds. Standing alone, cat-harness has none of it, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer. Paths are
 * composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory it was written in, so nothing it
 * reads changed.
