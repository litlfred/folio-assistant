/**
 * The living deck's alignment claims, re-checked against the KG — bean `scfh`.
 *
 * `docs/concepts/harnessed-kg-overview.md` says, slide by slide, where the 2026-09-30 snapshot
 * agrees with the knowledge graph and where it does not. Those sentences are
 * the part of the page that goes stale silently: the deck they came from went
 * stale exactly that way, which is why the owner asked for a living one. So each
 * claim the page makes about the KG is asserted here. When one fails, the KG
 * moved: update the slide's note in `docs/source/concepts-harnessed-kg-overview/` and this test
 * together. Do not relax the assertion alone.
 *
 * @module test/harnessed-kg-overview
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/harnessed-kg-overview.test.ts` to
 * the checkout's own test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06
 * "Top-level instance"): every test in it checks a claim of the living deck
 * against the whole checkout — core's diagrams, smart-base's index, the root
 * `beans/`, which only the whole checkout holds. Standing alone, cat-harness
 * has none of it, and `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in
 * that layer. Paths are composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory it was written
 * in, so nothing it reads changed.
