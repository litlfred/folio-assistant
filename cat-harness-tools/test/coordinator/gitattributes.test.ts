/**
 * `.gitattributes` — `-merge` may only cover a file its producer OWNS OUTRIGHT.
 *
 * Bean `oxka`. Three generated files conflicted on nearly every concurrent merge
 * (106, 45 and 18 commits in three days), so they are marked
 * `linguist-generated=true -diff -merge`: git stops attempting a line-by-line
 * merge on a file no human edits, and GitHub collapses it in review.
 *
 * ## The line this file exists to hold
 *
 * The test of whether a file belongs there is **not** "is it generated" — it is
 * **"does its producer carry anything forward from the existing file"**.
 *
 * `kg-audit` reads its prior judgements back (`readAttestations`), so the
 * file holding them carries adjudications an earlier run or a person recorded.
 * `-merge` on one would discard an attestation with nothing said. Since bean
 * `2gst` that file is the attestation store (`test/attestations/kg-qa/`), not
 * the `kg-qa` sidecar — and BOTH stay textually mergeable here. 840 generated
 * files live under `test/results/`, which makes a glob there the obvious and
 * wrong widening — and the reason this test exists rather than a comment.
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/` (bean `ho66`), as
 * `merge-guard-workflows.test.ts` was: every test in it reads the aggregate
 * repository's own root — `.gitattributes` and the CI workflow that gates it —
 * which a standalone cat-harness layer does not have, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer.
 *
 * Moved again, from `cat-harness-tools/scripts/tests/` to the checkout's own
 * test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06 "Top-level
 * instance"): what it reads belongs to the whole checkout, which the root
 * instance declares, not to any one layer — so cat-harness-tools stays green
 * standing alone too.
 *
 * ## The `test/results/` entries are retired (bean `7mwa`)
 *
 * cat-harness (cat-harness#857) and folio-assistant-core
 * (folio-assistant-core#482) no longer commit `test/results/`: the derived
 * verdicts live on the `qa-reports` store, keyed by commit. A path that is not
 * committed cannot conflict, so the `oxka` entry for
 * `audit-coverage.qa-results.json`, the `eqxp` entry for the `lsi-index` run
 * record, the two refused `eqxp` candidates and the "no glob over the results
 * tree" rule are gone from here (owner, 2026-11-01: "A. Retire in that tools
 * PR"). What stays is what is still committed: the generated pages marked
 * `-merge`, and the attestation store and `harness.json`, which must not be.
