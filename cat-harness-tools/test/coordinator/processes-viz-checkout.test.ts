 * every instance's diagrams, which only the checkout holds. Standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it, and `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects
 * every test in that layer. The rest of that file's tests stay there; every
 * path here is composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory they were written in,
 * so nothing they read changed.
