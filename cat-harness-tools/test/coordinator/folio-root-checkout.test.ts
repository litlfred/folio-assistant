/**
 * `folio-root` tests about the WHOLE CHECKOUT, moved here from
 * `cat-harness/scripts/tests/folio-root.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling
 * 2026-10-06 "Top-level instance"): each reads the root instance's declaration
 * (`folio-assistant.json`), which only the checkout holds. Standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it, and `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects
 * every test in that layer. The rest of that file's tests stay there; every
 * path here is composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory they were written in,
 * so nothing they read changed.
