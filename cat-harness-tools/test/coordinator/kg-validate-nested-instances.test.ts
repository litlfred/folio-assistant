/**
 * `kg:validate` owns a NESTED instance's path, so every committed kg-audit
 * sidecar is validated for a consumer, not only proved current.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins (bean `676g`)
 *
 * `kg:validate` resolved every path against ONE root, its own instance
 * (`cat-harness/`). Measured on `main` `cf3e624`:
 *
 * ```
 * kg:validate cat-harness/test/results/kg-qa/processes/adjudication.kg-qa.json   ✓ [qa]
 * kg:validate smart-dak/test/results/kg-qa/scenarios/kg.kg-qa.json
 *   ? … could not determine: no declared directory owns this path
 * ```
 *
 * Fixing the owner exposed the second half: the `qa` kind's validator refs
 * (`schemas/sdlc/kg-qa.ts#…`) are relative to the instance whose registry DEFINES
 * the kind, and resolving them against `smart-dak/` reported "does not exist".
 * Both halves are asserted here, over the REAL corpus, because the question is
 * whether the committed sidecars a reader picks up parse — not whether a
 * fixture does. `smart-dak` was retired since (D3, `26eabf673`), so the
 * nested example below is `smart-base`'s sidecar at the same relative path.
 *
 * ## Anti-vacuity
 *
 * A sweep over zero files passes. So the sweep must reach sidecars in several
 * instances OTHER than the auditor's own — the population this bean is about.
 *
 * ## Where the sidecars are read (bean `7mwa`)
 *
 * "Committed" stopped meaning "on disk" when cat-harness stopped committing
 * its QA working copy (cat-harness#857): an instance whose `qa` home is absent
 * is swept in the `qa-reports` store's newest `main` entry instead, at the
 * same checkout paths and by the same validator, because that is what every
 * reader then reads. An unreachable store is reported in the anti-vacuity
 * message, never read as clean. A MOUNTED layer's home is read from that
 * layer's OWN store at the commit the lock pins (`scripts/layer-qa.ts`;
 * owner, 2026-11-03, "2. Each layer publishes"): its QA is its repository's
 * to write (bean `nn8e`), published by `layer-qa-publish.yml`.
 *
 * @module test/kg-validate-nested-instances
 *
 * Moved here from
 * `cat-harness/scripts/tests/kg-validate-nested-instances.test.ts` to the
 * checkout's own test home `test/` (bean `7zz1`, owner ruling 2026-10-06
 * "Top-level instance"): every test in it validates the kg-audit sidecars of
 * every nested instance in the checkout, which only the whole checkout holds.
 * Standing alone, cat-harness has none of it, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer. Paths are
 * composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory it was written in, so nothing it
 * reads changed.
