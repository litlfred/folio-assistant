/**
 * Post-merge QA of main: the workflow's own guard keeps an `unknown` verdict
 * from going green while a layer still pins a report.py from before
 * cat-harness-tools#1961 (owner, Q-MQA-1 A, 2026-11-12), EXCEPT an `unknown`
 * that layer-pr-checks marked deferred: a push batched into its window's
 * integration run, or one that changes only pins (Q-MQA-2 A). #1968 had no
 * such exception and turned every batched push red; it was reverted (#1969).
 *
 * The step's script is read out of `layer-main-qa.yml` and run with a stub
 * report.py and a fake `gh` on PATH, so what is tested is the shell the
 * workflow runs, not a copy of it.
