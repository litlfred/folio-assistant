/**
 * The composition roots resolve their parts from declarations, and every way
 * of NOT resolving one is distinguishable from resolving it.
 *
 * `server.ts` imported six tool registrars, five route modules and
 * `src/index.ts` two adapter classes. Three of the registrars, three of the
 * routes and one of the adapters belong to another layer, so both generic
 * entry points named it — and after the split those imports do not resolve,
 * failing at MODULE LOAD, before either file's own error handling can run.
 *
 * The routes are the case where naming them is not merely inelegant but
 * measurably unfixable by reclassification: 10 wrong-direction edges with the
 * three content routes in the harness, 11 with them in core, because the
 * composition root then crosses the line to mount them.
 *
 * The negative cases are the ones worth having. A resolver that returned
 * nothing for every miss would pass "the platform's groups register" and still
 * let a server start silently missing half its tools.
