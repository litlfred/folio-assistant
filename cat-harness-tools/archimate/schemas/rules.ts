/**
 * `archimate-relationship-rules/v1`: the relationships a reference
 * architecture's authors allow between element types, written once as data.
 *
 * A reference architecture's document lists its rules ("an Application
 * Component realises an Application Service", "a Goal is composed of
 * sub-goals") and the relationship types it uses. Typed by hand, that table
 * says nothing about the model: the two drift, and nobody can tell. Held here,
 * the document's tables are drawn from it (Tool `archimate-blocks`) and the
 * model is checked against it.
 *
 * The rules are in charge, not the model (owner, 2026-11-01, smart-ra Q-RAC-2
 * "the rules stay in charge"): a model relationship no rule covers is reported
 * for the model's authors to fix or for the editors to add a rule. Nothing
 * here rewrites the rules from the model.
