 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-30, of `…/views/id-007936f8c2424b96ad1893ef0ff66059/`:
 * *"do we need to use such ugly IDs … why not nicer slug IRIs?"*; then, of
 * the designs offered (cat-harness-tools#1054), *"B. clean break ok"*.
 *
 * ## The id stays the IRI; the slug is where the page is
 *
 * A node's `@id` is still `<m>/views/<archi id>.jsonld`: Archi's ids are what
 * the RA mapper keys on. Only the PAGE is at a slug, `<m>/views/<slug>/`.
 * Relationships are almost all unnamed (smart-ra 0.2.0: 6 of 284), so their
 * pages stay at their ids.
 *
 * ## Worked out on every build, and a clean break
 *
 * Slugs come from the names each build ({@link planSlugs}); nothing is
 * committed and nothing redirects. The page at an old id path is gone, and a
 * rename moves a page. That is the trade the owner chose: the id IRI is the
 * permanent identifier, the page path is for reading.
 *
 * - A slug is the name in lower-case words joined by `-`, cut at a word break
 *   at {@link SLUG_MAX}.
 * - An author can choose one in Archi with a `slug` property on the view or
 *   element. It must be lower-case words joined by `-`; two objects choosing
 *   the same one is refused, because a rewritten slug is a path nobody chose.
 * - On a clash, the object first in the model keeps the plain slug and each
 *   later one gets `-<first hex of its id>`.
 * - An object with no readable name keeps its id as its path.
