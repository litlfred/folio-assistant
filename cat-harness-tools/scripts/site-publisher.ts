/**
 * Which publisher a repository uses, and where its code comes from: the
 * SITE-PUBLISHER slot that `stage-local.ts` reaches a higher layer's publish
 * path through.
 *
 * @module scripts/site-publisher
 * @covers none — the slot and the workflow reading that chooses a publisher; it builds and judges nothing
 *
 * ## Why a slot
 *
 * The FHIR-IG publish path lives in the layer that owns IG builds, and this
 * layer names no higher one, so `stage-local.ts` reaches it through the
 * pipeline-plugin mechanism: a layer declares a `folio-pipeline-plugin/v1`
 * node whose `slot` starts with {@link SITE_PUBLISHER_SLOT_PREFIX}, naming a
 * table that holds a {@link SitePublisherDeclaration}, and
 * `loadContributionsSync` finds it through the repository's declared
 * dependencies. One contributor per slot, as for every pipeline slot: which
 * code publishes an IG must not depend on the order the dependencies are
 * listed in.
 *
 * The FOLIO publisher is this layer's own (`folio-staging.yml` is the
 * platform's reusable workflow), so it is built in, not a slot.
 *
 * ## Read from the workflow, never restated
 *
 * A repository names the reusable workflow it publishes with in its own
 * `.github/workflows/*.yml` (`uses: <owner>/<repo>/.github/workflows/<file>@<ref>`).
 * Each publisher declares the workflow FILE NAMES it publishes for, and the
 * repository's callers decide which one applies ({@link detectPublisher}).
