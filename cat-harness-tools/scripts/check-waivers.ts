/**
 * Every recorded waiver is well formed, in a gate class that exists, and dated.
 *
 * Skill: `skills/conduct/conduct-core/confirmation-waiver.md` (a person may
 * waive confirmation, e.g. for a session or a process run).
 *
 * A node that does not parse against {@link WaiverNodeSchema} is **no
 * waiver**, reported loudly, and the gate it named stands. `gate` is a closed
 * enum, so a waiver over a non-waivable rule fails at the schema.
 *
 * | | |
 * |---|---|
 * | **in force** | parses, unexpired — listed, because a waived action is an announced one |
 * | **inert** | parses, expired — history, kept and never deleted, never a finding |
 * | **malformed** | does not parse, or the clock cannot be read — a defect, and loud |
 *
 * A declared directory holding no waiver node is a **determined empty** (no
 * waiver granted). A directory that cannot be READ exits 2, unknown.
 *
 * It reads the directories declaring the `waiver` graph (shared with
 * `memory`), so a file is a waiver by its `$schema` tag and nothing else.
