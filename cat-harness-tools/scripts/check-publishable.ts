/**
 * check-publishable.ts — a census of which layers are publishable, plus
 * the two cross-instance rules a per-instance schema cannot see.
 *
 * Absence is a third state: a layer that has not declared `publishable`
 * is *undecided*, never *false*. The report prints three buckets and names
 * every undecided layer; an all-undecided repository is reported as such,
 * not as a pass.
 *
 * `CatHarnessDeclarationSchema` already refuses an `id`/`version`/`canonicalUrl`
 * that does not match the layer's `publishable` state, and a range version.
 * This adds the CROSS-INSTANCE rules:
 *
 * 1. **Two layers must not share an `id`.**
 * 2. **An unreadable declaration is a finding, not a skip.** Its
 *    publishability is unknown (a fact about this run), which is not
 *    undecided (a fact about the repository).
 *
 * @module scripts/check-publishable
