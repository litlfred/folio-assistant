/**
 * A built site carries a page for every declared visualiser that has something
 * to show, in this checkout: the root layer and every layer it needs.
 *
 * @module scripts/site-coverage
 * @graphNode none — a guard over a built site, run by `build-instance-site.ts`
 *
 * It compares the built site with what the declarations say it should hold.
 * The parity guard (`site-parity.ts`) only measures a build against the root
 * it replaces, so it cannot miss a page that was never published; this can.
 *
 * ## What is expected
 *
 * For each visualiser `declaredVisualisers` reads in the checkout (which, in a
 * repository's own index, is that repository and its `needs`):
 *   - `<locale>/<harness>/<visualiser>/` when a directory it covers holds
 *     anything;
 *   - with `subgraphs: "instance"`, also `…/<instance>/` for each layer
 *     whose covered directory holds an ENTRY (a sub-directory): a library
 *     whose only file is its `library.json` has no entries to show. Where the
 *     writer reads its layers with a reader of its own
 *     ({@link SUBJECT_READERS}), that reader decides instead, so the guard and
 *     the writer cannot disagree about which layers have a page.
 * A page is there when the route holds `index.html` (the built site) or
 * `index.md` (a Jekyll source).
 *
 * Usage: bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/site-coverage.ts <site dir> [--root <checkout>] [--staging] [--json]
 * Exit: 0 every expected page is there · 1 a page is missing.
