/**
 * Run the gates CI runs — DERIVED from the workflow, never listed here.
 *
 * The question a contributor needs answered before pushing is *"what will CI
 * run against my change"*, and only the workflow knows that. `package.json`
 * over-answers it (many `check:` scripts are gated by no workflow, some
 * deliberately excluded, e.g. `check:ci-health` is a report); a
 * hand-maintained list drifts.
 *
 * ## Fast vs full is DERIVED too
 *
 * From job membership: a job that installs a browser ({@link installsBrowser})
 * is in `--all` only, and every other job is in the fast set. The `e2e` job
 * installs Chromium, which is why `render:bpmn:check` lives there. The rule is
 * the predicate, never a job's name, so it moves jobs when the workflow does.
 *
 * ## The vacuity guard
 *
 * If the extraction finds no commands it **fails**: a runner over an empty
 * list would exit 0 and read as a clean sweep.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat gates              # the fast set — every job that installs no browser
 *   bun run cat gates --all        # plus the jobs that need a browser
 *   bun run cat gates --list       # print them and exit, running nothing
 *   bun run cat gates --jobs 3     # pool size for read-only gates (default: CPUs - 1)
 *   bun run cat gates --no-cache   # ask every gate; neither read nor update the input-hash cache
 *   bun run cat gates --except "bun test"   # hold one gate out (repeatable); named in the report as `heldOut`
 *
 * Gates whose script declares `outputs: []` in `task-io.ts` run in a worker
 * pool, output printed in workflow order; every other gate runs alone. A gate
 * whose declared inputs are unchanged since it last passed is SKIPPED and
 * reported as such ({@link GateSkipper}).
 *

 * Why a step CI runs is not in the local set.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes, and what it cost
 *
 * This module read ONE workflow. Measured 2026-09-20: four others carry `bun`
 * steps CI executes and no local command did. It surfaced the way it had to —
 * `bun run cat gates --all` passed 46 gates on a tree CI then rejected, because
 * the npm script behind one gate was a strict SUBSET of the workflow's four
 * steps. "Green locally" and "green in CI" were two different claims with
 * nothing saying so, which is the `dh4f` shape applied to a checker rather
 * than a directory.
 *
 * ## Two legitimate reasons a step stays out, and one that is not
 *
 * **`covered-by`** — the workflow runs a GENERATOR and the gate set already
 * runs its `--check` twin. Running both locally would regenerate and then
 * verify what was just written, which passes by construction.
 *
 * **`ci-only`** — the step needs something a checkout does not have: a built
 * `_site`, a `gh-pages` working tree, a deploy slug off the event payload.
 *
 * **`no-folio`** — the step's INPUT is a folio's tree, and this repository is
 * the platform. `AGENTS.md` states the fact and names two of them; the table
 * below is the first place a machine can read it.
 *
 * Say it precisely, because the imprecise version was wrong here for two
 * months and three entries still carried it on 2026-09-20: **the scripts are
 * the platform's** — `cat-harness-tools/scripts/audit-wiring.ts` and friends are
 * right here. Two entries said "no such path in the platform", which was
 * false, and a third said the platform "has no `pipeline/`", which was also
 * false. An exemption resting on a false reason is precisely what this table
 * exists to prevent, so the error mattered more here than it would have in
 * prose (bean `52dz`).
 *
 * **And the corrected version was still wrong, one turn later.** It said what
 * these steps lack is "the `content/` tree they read" — owner, 2026-09-20:
 * *"content/ shouldnt be expected anymore. folio/ was renamed as
 * default/convention."* So `no-folio` here does not mean "a folio tree we
 * happen not to carry". It means these steps `cd` into `content/`, a root the
 * convention has moved off. `cat-harness/harness.json` already declares
 * `folio/` holding the `folio` graph and carries no `content` entry at all.
 *
 * Two corrections to one paragraph in one day is the argument for the table
 * rather than against it: prose drifts silently, an entry here is read by
 * `check:workflow-paths` and by `gates.test.ts`.
 *
 * The one case where the distinction has teeth: `pipeline/build.ts` runs after
 * `cd content` and names a FOLIO's build, while `cat-harness/content/pipeline/
 * build.ts` exists and is a different file with the same basename. "Fixing"
 * the path to the platform's copy would look correct and silently run the
 * wrong program. `check:workflow-paths` records that as a `FOLIO_PATHS`
 * exemption with the same reason, and a test pins it.
 *
 * `52dz`'s owner ruling (2026-09-24) settled the rest: the generic QA
 * workflows and the Lean workflows that `cd content` were moved OUT of
 * `.github/workflows/` into the platform's `templates/`, which `folio_init`
 * writes into a new folio pointed at `folio/`. Their entries left this table
 * with them — an exemption for a step no workflow here runs is the stale
 * claim `gates.test.ts` refuses.
 *
 * These steps are not broken and not runnable here, and until this table
 * existed nothing could tell either from a real gap.
 *
 * **Not a reason: "it is slow" or "it usually passes."** A step with no entry
 * here is reported as UNCLASSIFIED and fails `gates.test.ts`, so a new
 * workflow step lands in the gate set or in this table, and never in the gap
 * between them. The reason is required for the same cause `folio:no-skill`
 * and `workflow-policy.json` require one: an exemption nobody can review is
 * one somebody added to get to green.

 * ## Why a command carrying one is NOT a gate

 * The extraction keeps `bun …` lines and discards everything else, which

 * `code-quality-gates.yml` writes
 *
 *     base="$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD 2>/dev/null || true)"   # :1345
 *     bun run cat translation:catalogue:check -- --base "$base"           # :1348
 *
 * and only the second line survives. Run as written, git is handed a ref
 * literally named `$base`, so the check exits 2 with *"could not determine:
 * git would not list what this change adds (`$base..HEAD`)"* — on every
 * branch, forever. Measured 2026-10-02, bean `9zok`: this made
 * `bun run cat gates` report `✗ 1 of 210` on a clean tree, which means the STRICT
 * pre-push rule in `AGENTS.md` was unsatisfiable as written.
 *
 * ## Why skipping loses nothing, and why that was checked rather than assumed
 *
 * The obvious worry is that skipping hides a gate. It does not here, and the
 * reason is measurable: the SAME script is invoked twice in that workflow —
 * once with `--base` for CI, which has a PR base sha, and once bare at :1321
 * for when it does not. Both are extracted, so the bare form already runs in
 * the same sweep. Measured on this workflow: 2 `translation:catalogue`
 * invocations extracted, and exactly 1 command in the whole set carrying an
 * unexpanded variable.
 *
 * ## It is reported, never silently dropped
 *
 * This file's own `NoGatesFound` doctrine is that a reader finding nothing is
 * not a clean sweep. The same applies one command at a time: a skipped
 * command is printed every run under its own heading, so "this reader cannot
 * run it" stays distinguishable from "it passed". Resolving the variable
 * properly would mean executing the workflow's shell, which is a different
 * and much larger thing than reading it.

 * will CI run against my change"* and only the workflow knows that. Running
 * every script in `package.json` would fail on things CI does not gate.

 * be compared against the set it describes, which is why the other three
 * (`health:check`, `landing:data:check`, `landing:sticky:check`) had no reason

/**
 * Skipping a gate whose inputs have not changed since it last passed — bean `f017`.
 *
 * ## Why gates may skip at all
 *
 * The merge cycle is `regen` then `gates`, on the same tree. `regen` has just
 * asked every verify/write pair, and `gates` asks each of those checks again —
 * and `skill:register:check` twice in one run, because two CI jobs run it.
 * A check whose DECLARED inputs (`task-io.ts`) hash to what they were when it
 * last passed cannot answer differently, so asking again buys nothing.
 *
 * ## What may be skipped, and what never is
 *
 * Only a gate that is exactly `bun run <script>` whose script declares
 * `inputs`, and only when the input-hash cache holds a hash for THAT SCRIPT
 * equal to its fingerprint now — recorded by a real run that exited 0 (by
 * `gates`, or by `regen`'s check). Everything else runs: undeclared scripts,
 * inputs that cannot be determined, a moved `--against` baseline, `CI`, or
 * `--no-cache`. A skipped gate is reported as SKIPPED, by name and with its
 * reason, and counted apart from the gates that passed — never as a pass.
 *
 * ## Recording
 *
 * A gate's hash is recorded only when it exited 0 AND its fingerprint was the
 * same just before and just after it ran (`recordCheckRun`): a gate whose
 * inputs moved while it read them — a writer, a person editing, the gate
 * itself — records nothing.
 *
 * **The falsifier** is a script that reads something its declaration does not
 * name; `task-io.ts` carries the rule (declare by reading, `{tracked}` for
 * whole-tree walkers, nothing for environment, network or clock readers).

  // "no gate commands were extracted. That is not a clean sweep, it is a broken
  // reader" — and it throws for both shapes: the workflow file absent, and the
  // file present but yielding nothing. The defect was here, in the CLI, which
  // let that throw escape as an uncaught exception and so reported a
  // could-not-determine as exit **1**, indistinguishable from a real failure.

  // So this block adds no detection. It translates a refusal the library already
  // makes into the exit code the third-state rule requires, and there is
  // deliberately NO `gates.length === 0` branch underneath it: that check cannot
  // fire, because `loadGates` throws first. A guard that cannot fire is the
  // `build-glossary` dead-guard defect, which reads as protection and is not.
