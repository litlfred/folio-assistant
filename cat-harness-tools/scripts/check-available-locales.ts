/**
 * A page may not claim a language a reader cannot read it in.
 *
 * `available_locales` is defined by `translation-manager.md` as *"which
 * languages can I read this page in"*. This gate holds the corpus to that
 * sentence: every locale a page claims must have a RENDERED page behind it.
 *
 * ## Why a gate when the generator already gets it right
 *
 * Because most of the corpus is not generated. 94 pages declare the field and
 * only 24 are source pages; the other 70 are hand-authored translations that
 * stamp their own list. `gen-docs-pages.ts` now computes the field from the
 * translation index and `docs:pages:check` holds it to a fixpoint, so a
 * GENERATED page cannot drift. Nothing was watching the other 70, and nothing
 * was watching a hand-authored source page either.
 *
 * That is the half of `9x01` a generator fix cannot reach. The bean's own case
 * — `crdm-methodology` claiming `fr` on the strength of a 25-line catalogue
 * with one filled `msgstr` and no French page anywhere — happened to be
 * generated. The next one need not be.
 *
 * ## Over-claiming only, deliberately
 *
 * A page claiming a locale it has no rendering for is a promise to a reader
 * that cannot be kept: the language bar offers a link and the coverage badge
 * counts a language. A page claiming FEWER locales than it has renderings for
 * is a different defect — it hides work that exists rather than inventing work
 * that does not — and it is the generator's to get right, which it now does.
 * Folding both into one gate would make a single red mean two unrelated things.
 *
 * ## A translated page is resolved through its SOURCE
 *
 * `docs/fr/architecture.md` is not a source page: the index keys translations
 * under the page they translate, so looking it up by its own key would find no
 * entry and report every locale it claims as unbacked. All 70 translated pages
 * would fail, which is how this check looked the first time it ran. The index
 * is inverted here — translated page key → source key — rather than
 * re-resolving `translation_source` by hand, because the index has already done
 * that resolution and doing it twice is two answers free to disagree.
 *
 * ## Three states
 *
 * The index carries findings, and an index that could not be read is not an
 * index with no translations. On a non-`note` finding this exits 2 without
 * judging the corpus, because a clean verdict computed from an unreadable index
 * is the `dh4f` defect — a consumer scanning nothing and reporting a clean run
 * over it. Finding no page that declares the field at all is the same failure
 * wearing different clothes, and also exits 2: a sweep over an empty set
 * asserts nothing, and this file's assertions would all hold vacuously (`6tkl`).
 *
 * Only tracked files are examined. A gate over what the repository PUBLISHES
 * should judge what the repository holds, and an untracked scratch page under
 * `docs/` is not that.
 *
 * `docs` is the graph kind this audits — `cat-harness.json` declares `docs/`
 * with `graphs: ["docs"]`, and the locale subtrees walked here are part of it.
 * Declared rather than inferred, per `3srh`: a gate that does not say what it
 * audits turns every "unaudited" count into an upper bound rather than a
 * verdict.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run check:available-locales
 *
 * Bean `9x01`.
