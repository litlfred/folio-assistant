/**
 * cat-harness holds no code: every source file under it is a ratcheted debt.
 *
 * @module cat-harness-tools/scripts/check-content-code-free
 * @covers code — every tracked file under the cat-harness instance, read by extension only
 *
 * The harness is content: its manifests, Tool definitions and skill records
 * are JSON data that the tools validate on read, and code lives in
 * cat-harness-tools. So no tracked `.ts/.js/.py/.sh` belongs under
 * `cat-harness/`.
 *
 * The gate is a ratchet. The committed list
 * (`content-code-free-baseline.json`) names every code file still allowed. A
 * code file NOT on the list is red: new code in content. A listed file that
 * is gone is reported with the command that shortens the list, and is not
 * red, so a move landing elsewhere never turns an unrelated PR red. The list
 * only ever shrinks.
 *
 * Code is decided by extension: `.ts .tsx .mts .cts .js .mjs .cjs .py .sh .rb`
 * (`.rb` is how Jekyll plugins are written). Git decides what is tracked.
 *
 * Exempt by rule:
 *
 * - browser assets: a `.js`/`.mjs` under `site-chrome/assets/`,
 *   `site-chrome/_includes/` or `docs/assets/` is a file the site ships to
 *   the browser, next to the include that loads it;
 * - two build helpers: the folio file-list renderer (`folio-render/`) and the
 *   Jekyll plugins (`_plugins/*.rb`), part of the same chrome layout;
 * - anything under a path the harness declares `builtAtPublish`: written by a
 *   writer at publish, never tracked. In a mounted checkout there is no git
 *   index to say so, so the corpus is a walk, and a publish-built page's
 *   script (`docs/en/cat-harness/processes/task-panel.js`, `processes:viz`)
 *   read as code in content (folio-assistant#2985).
 *
 * Usage: bun run cat check:content-code-free [--update] [--no-baseline]
 * Exit:  0 when every code file is listed · 1 otherwise
