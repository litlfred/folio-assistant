/**
 * The KG subscriptions page: the known substrates, and what each layer has
 * subscribed to and chosen to hold. The design is
 * `docs/proposals/kg-subscriptions.md` §"Known substrates" and §"The visualizer".
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat subscriptions:viz          # write the subscriptions page under this instance's site directory
 * bun run cat subscriptions:viz:check    # fail when it is stale
 * ```
 *
 * ## Known substrates are DERIVED where a fact exists
 *
 * Four sources, merged by `name`, the later overriding the earlier:
 *
 * 1. every layer in the checkout that declares a planned `repository` other
 *    than the one it lives in today, which is `planned`;
 * 2. every `associatedHarnesses` entry, which is `exists` (it has a site);
 * 3. every `subscriptions` entry, which is `exists` (it is pinned to a commit
 *    of a repository that was read) — needed because a subscription may not
 *    also be an associated harness;
 * 4. every `knownSubstrates` hand row, for what no declaration can say.
 *
 * So a staged layer appears the moment it declares its planned home, and
 * nobody keeps a second list of it.
 *
 * ## Nothing here needs the network
 *
 * A subscription's STATE is read from the checkout only: a chosen part with no
 * materialisation record is drawn as not yet held, never as held, and never as
 * missing. A part WITH a record (`kg:materialize`) is drawn from that record:
 * ⬇ held, and its bytes still hash to it; ⚠ held at another pin, or bytes
 * that no longer match; ✗ a gate refused; ? a gate unanswered or a record
 * unreadable — could-not-determine is drawn, never hidden. What upstream looks
 * like right now is `refresh-materialized`'s question, not this page's.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/subscriptions-viz
 * @covers cat-harness, docs — the subscriptions and known substrates every declaration states
