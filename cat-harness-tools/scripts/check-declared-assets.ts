/**
 * Every declared asset exists, and its links resolve.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-declared-assets
 * @covers cat-harness
 *
 * This checks **whatever an instance declares** as an asset (such as its
 * `AGENTS.md`), not one special-cased file: a file nobody declares is a file
 * no checker looks at. A newly declared markdown asset is covered with no
 * change here. (`readme:audit` verifies `README.md` alone, and
 * `check:agents-xref` citations INTO `AGENTS.md`.)
 *
 * ## Three states
 *
 * - **missing** — declared and not on disk. A finding: somebody asserted this
 *   file is ours (unlike a conventional directory an instance may not use).
 * - **dead link** — a relative target that does not resolve.
 * - **not checked** — a non-markdown asset, a link this cannot resolve
 *   offline (`http(s)`, `mailto`), or a link into one of the instance's own
 *   declared directories that is not on disk in this checkout. Reported as
 *   such and never counted clean.
 *
 * The last case is a site that mounts only some of a layer's directories
 * (an `overrides.<instance>.directories` list in `index.config.json`): the
 * layer's README may link into a directory the site chose not to mount, and
 * that link is not dead, only out of this checkout. Whether a declared
 * directory exists at all is `check:declared-dirs`'s question, not this one.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 clean · 1 any missing asset or dead link.

/**
 * Instances whose declarations this repository owns — **discovered, not
 * listed**, via {@link instanceRootsIn}.
 *
 * This was a literal `["cat-harness", "bootstrap"]`, and the docstring on it
 * recorded the list being wrong ONCE already: the first entry was `"."`, which
 * named the instance while the instance was the repository, and after the move
 * (bean `wggr`) it named a root carrying no `harness.json`, so `declaredAssets`
 * returned `[]` and this gate reported *"1 declared asset across 2 instances,
 * 0 findings"* over a file it had never opened.
 *
 * The list was then wrong a SECOND time, the same way. Recording that a
 * hardcoded list went stale, and then fixing it by correcting the hardcoded
 * list, buys one release. Asking the filesystem is what stops the third time
 * (bean `6tkl`).
 *
 * **How far it had drifted, measured 2026-09-20 while adding the sixth
 * instance** (the formal-math layer, bean `frs5`): the list still said two while
 * `folio-assist-core`, the IRIS replica, `detangle`, `kg-navigation` and
 * `large-datasets` had all arrived. Five instances the gate had never opened,
 * reported in the same words as a clean run — and the README declared by
 * the formal-math layer's brand-new `harness.json` would have been the sixth.
 * Widening it immediately found a dead link the list had been hiding.
