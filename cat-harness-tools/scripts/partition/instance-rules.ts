/**
 * THIS instance's partition data — the five-repo target of issue #223, the
 * layering it permits, and the ~190 path entries that say which module is
 * whose.
 *
 * ## It is a module rather than a JSON document, on purpose
 *
 * 65% of the rules below is comment. Those comments are not decoration: each
 * one records how its entry was arrived at, usually by measurement ("measured
 * by putting these in the harness list at the bottom first and watching the
 * two edges survive"; "omitting it cost 3 wrong-direction edges the day #468
 * merged"). A JSON table cannot hold a note positioned beside the entry it
 * explains, and a `why` field per rule would flatten per-ENTRY notes into
 * per-RULE ones. So the split keeps the mechanism generic and leaves the data
 * here, which is `detangler-topic-coherence`'s repair with the host chosen to
 * fit what the data actually is.
 *
 * ## What another instance does
 *
 * Writes its own file like this one and hands it to
 * `scripts/partition/engine.ts`. Nothing in the engine names a repo, a
 * directory or a layer.
 *
 * ## The declared-path literals live here now
 *
 * 36 of the 96 entries in `declared-path-baseline.json` were keyed on
 * `scripts/repo-partition.ts`; they are keyed on this file after the move.
 * That is not churn to be minimised — the literals genuinely moved, and the
 * baseline is keyed by the file that holds them so that a literal appearing
 * in a NEW file is visible as new.

 * ## `name` is the TARGET REPO; `instance` is where it is staged today
 *
 * These are two different facts and were one string until 2026-09-26, which
 * is how they drifted. `name` is what the repository will be called when
 * #223 cuts it. `instance` is the directory staging it in this pre-split
 * checkout, and it must equal that directory's own declared `name` — the
 * declaration is the source of truth, so `instance` is a POINTER to it, not
 * a second copy. `partition-names.test.ts` holds them equal.
 *
 * `kg` carries no `instance` ON PURPOSE. `smart-kg` is a Phase III target
 * for WHO L1 document and KG schemas that this checkout does not hold, so it
 * has 0 modules. That is a target not yet staged, NOT a `dh4f`
 * declared-but-absent defect, and the two must not be conflated: the first is
 * a plan, the second is a consumer scanning nothing and reporting a clean run.
 * `undefined` says "no instance yet"; it never means "the instance is missing".
 *
 * ## Why three of these were renamed
 *
 * `folio-assist-core` and `folio-asst-sci` were ABBREVIATIONS of the declared
 * names — no decision behind "asst", just terser — and `agentic-harness`
 * predates the owner's rename of the harness to `cat-harness`, which the
 * declaration, the directory and `AGENTS.md` all already carry. Only the
 * architecture docs and this table still said the old thing.
 *
 * The docs page `/concepts/agentic-harness.html` is NOT this name and was not touched:
 * it documents the agent-user interaction model, which is a concept rather
 * than a repository, and its slug is a published URL.

      // d903); build-document-site (core) calls it, core -> harness.
      // HARNESS, by the same test as `check-ci-health.ts` above: its subject is
      // this checkout's own ENVIRONMENT — whether a nested `node_modules` or a
      // symlinked root makes a tool answer a question about the repository from
      // something the repository does not contain (bean `3vc1`). It reads no
      // folio material and no content schema; it imports `node:fs` and
      // `node:path` and nothing else, so it cannot drag a folio in. `gates.ts`
      // is its only caller and is itself harness, so the edge runs
      // harness -> harness.
      // The IMPORT half of that arrow, over every declared instance (bean
      // `p11x`). Harness for the same reason: it reads declarations and module
      // specifiers, consumes the same `layer-direction.ts`, and no folio content.
      // The PROCESS-BINDING half of that arrow (owner, 2026-10-03): which
      // instance a BPMN's `<skill ref>` reaches. Harness for the same reason —
      // it reads declarations, BPMN extension elements and skill file names,
      // consumes the same `layer-direction.ts`, and no folio content.
      // HARNESS, for the same reason: it judges directory declarations'
      // `derivedFrom` edges with the same reach, and reads no folio content.
      // HARNESS, beside it (bean `0b8c`): runs the writers of the artefacts
      // check:derived-from names as built at publish; reads declarations only.
      // HARNESS: the staging cone (bean `4j86`) computes over declarations and
      // module specifiers, and reads no folio content.
      // HARNESS on the same argument: its subjects are this repository's own
      // generated navigation (`_data/harness.json`, the navbar include, the
      // rail written into viewer pages) and its landing templates. It opens
      // no folio content (bean `ob3m` finding 6).
      // HARNESS: the one orphan-page selector (bean `s8nu`), extracted as a
      // LEAF so `state-visualizer.ts` can be a call site without importing
      // `gen-schema-viz.ts` -- a 1200-line page generator whose body is one
      // template literal. Same move #840 made for the graph-typology registry.
      // It imports `node:fs` and `node:path` and nothing else, so it cannot
      // drag a layer in behind it; its subject is which pages a generator in
      // this repository wrote, not any folio's content.
      // HARNESS with the gate above, which imports it: it runs `kg-export`
      // once per declared instance for this repository's deploy, and reads
      // only the declarations (bean `4ak5`).
      // HARNESS beside `root-index.ts`, by the same `dh4f` question: it writes
      // an INDEX checkout's root `AGENTS.md`/`README.md` from
      // `index.config.json` and the instances' declared assets (owner
      // 2026-10-09, `index:render`) — the platform's entry files, no folio's
      // content. Its one core import, `readme-sections` (the marker splice),
      // is not a wrong-direction edge: it is a command (shebang), so a
      // composition root, and `isCompositionRoot` exempts it by rule.
      // The two halves this tool was split into, 2026-09-20. Both HARNESS,
      // and the target-before-importer test says why: `engine.ts` imports
      // nothing but `fs` and `path`, and this file imports one TYPE from
      // it. Neither reaches for a folio, so neither can drag one in.
      //
      // They are listed rather than covered by a `scripts/partition/`
      // prefix ON PURPOSE: a prefix would claim whatever lands in that
      // directory next, and a rule that classifies by location will keep
      // reclaiming. The gate caught both of these as unassigned the first
      // time it ran after the split, which is the behaviour worth keeping.
      // HARNESS, and the reasoning is the same as `check-ci-health` above:
      // it reasons about INSTANCES and their declarations — which harness
      // instantiated which directory, and where that mounts on the published
      // site. It never opens a content object. The owner's addressing rule
      // (`<base-url>/<path-to-kind-or-node>`) is a statement about harnesses,
      // not about what a folio holds.
      // Its reader of `withheld.json` (bean `mkao`): what an instance must not
      // publish. Same layer — it is a question about what a harness puts on
      // the site, answered from a list the instance declares — and shared with
      // the library viewer so the two publishing channels read ONE answer.
      // The harness navigation it injects into those pages. Same layer by the
      // same argument: the rail is the HARNESS's chrome, and it exists because
      // a mounted page gets no Jekyll layout. Putting it in a folio's
      // generator would give every instance its own copy of the platform's
      // navbar, which is the boundary AGENTS.md opens with.
      // The renderer that rail became an adapter over (bean `sjic`). HARNESS
      // by the same argument and more strongly: it is now the ONE navbar, for
      // a mounted page and for a Jekyll page alike, so a folio owning it would
      // mean a folio owning the platform's chrome for every other instance
      // too. It renders a model and reads no content object -- the model's
      // regions are composed by the caller from declarations.
      // The ONE conversion from a harness row's resolved mark to that
      // navbar's fields (bean `2vpn`). HARNESS beside `navbar.ts`: every
      // surface that draws a harness's mark calls it, so a folio owning it
      // would let one instance decide how every other instance's mark is read.
      // What that chrome's data says on a FOLIO's own site (#2263): its tiles,
      // icon row and rail scopes scoped to the folio, the platform's graphs
      // re-based onto the platform. HARNESS beside `harness-rail.ts`: it is the
      // platform deciding how its own chrome reads elsewhere, and a folio
      // owning it would let one instance decide what every other shows.
      // How a GRAPH-TYPOLOGY row in that navbar is marked and named (bean `yag0`):
      // the kind's avatar glyph and hue, and the head of its registered
      // summary as the accessible name. HARNESS beside `navbar.ts` for the
      // same reason — it is the platform's chrome, read from the platform's
      // kind and avatar registries, and both navbar callers share it.
      // The light/dark half of that chrome (issue #2208): dark rules that
      // follow the navbar's switch, and the saved-scheme first-paint snippet.
      // HARNESS beside `navbar.ts` -- the switch is the platform's, and every
      // page carrying it, a folio's included, has to agree on what it means.
      // The locale half of that chrome (issue #2219): the docs pages'
      // `fa-translation-meta` block, written onto a MOUNTED page so it draws
      // the same band globe. HARNESS beside `scheme-css.ts` -- it is
      // `head_custom.html`'s block, and a folio owning it would let one
      // instance decide what every other mounted page declares.
      // The migration a renamed or major-bumped NODE KIND ships with (issue
      // #2195): rewrites `$schema` values only. HARNESS, beside the node-kind
      // machinery in `schemas/kg/node-kind.ts` it serves.
      // The generic node-kind pages (issue #2195): one per kind, harness and
      // node. HARNESS for the reason the viewer pages are: it is the
      // platform's view of any harness's nodes, and its reader beside it.
      // The geometry that navbar became a reader of, and the generator that
      // renders it to CSS (bean `sjic`). HARNESS for the same reason as
      // `navbar.ts` and one step more plainly: the numbers are the width of
      // the PLATFORM's chrome on every instance's pages at once, so a folio
      // owning them would set the navbar's width for every other folio. The
      // generator writes into the site's own asset directory, deriving the
      // path from `siteDirFor` rather than naming it, so it does not know
      // which instance it is writing for either.
      // The rail's shared assets (bean `lnoy`): `navbar.css` from `navbarCss()`
      // and `navbar.js` bundled from `navbar-client.ts`, the browser half of
      // `renderRailRegions`. HARNESS for the same reason as `navbar.ts`: the
      // platform's chrome on every instance's pages, written into the site's
      // own asset directory through `siteDirFor`.
      // Its sibling: same question, same answer. `compose-docs.ts` reads the
      // `docs` declarations, works out which is the base and which the
      // overlay from `scope`, and lays them down in order. Every decision it
      // makes is about INSTANCES and where their directories resolve; it
      // opens the files only to copy bytes, and never asks what a page says.
      // Where the built instance's docs pages publish (`docs/<name>`, bean
      // `kc7k`), and Jekyll's permalink rule that puts them there, read once
      // for every generator that links to a page by its source path. Both
      // are about the SITE's addressing, the platform's concern, and neither
      // reads what a page says.
      // Whether a swimlane DEFINES itself — `name`, `<documentation>`, and
      // both reaching the translation templates. Harness by subject for the
      // same reason as its neighbour above: a lane is a ROLE boundary, which
      // is a platform concept, and the diagrams it reads are the platform's
      // own processes. A folio that draws none still inherits the rule.
      // ...and the signals themselves, lifted out of it by bean `xfoh` so the
      // patterns could be checked against the skill prose they transcribe.
      // Same side as its runner, and harness by subject too: whether a request
      // is a PLATFORM capability change is a question about the platform, and a
      // folio that never asks for one still needs the answer to be "no".

      // Reported `unassigned` on 2026-09-18 and read one at a time, same
      // question as the rest of this list: does it act on PLATFORM or on
      // CONTENT? All six act on harness-level graphs — Tools, the knowledge
      // graph, the instance declaration, the CI workflows — so none of them
      // needs a folio to have anything to do.
      // Reported `unassigned` on 2026-10-09: the npm packaging of a graph and
      // the query engine over its N-Quads. Harness by subject — they package,
      // fetch and query an instance's KNOWLEDGE GRAPH, whatever it holds, and
      // a folio could not make any of them act differently.
      // Harness by subject: the slice is the platform's own work plan, and the
      // per-slice SQLite contract is a kg-export one (bean `q8ar`).
      // Third question about the same built tree, and harness-level for the same
      // reason: it asks whether the markdown converter refused a block of HTML
      // and escaped it, which is a property of the RENDER PIPELINE, not of any
      // folio's subject matter. It imports nothing but `node:fs` — a folio could
      // not make it answer differently.
      // Its merge-time sibling, and harness-level for the same reason: it
      // resolves conflicts in the `qa` graph by re-running whichever writer
      // the sidecars name. It reads the DECLARATION, `package.json` and git's
      // index, and nothing in it is about any folio's subject matter — a folio
      // could not make it resolve differently, only give it more files.
      // Where the `qa` graph is KEPT once it leaves main (bean `16ei`): the
      // read/write API over the `qa-reports` branch. Harness-level for the
      // same reason as its two neighbours — it reads the declaration and git,
      // and no folio's subject matter could make it answer differently.
      // Its generalisation (bean `2h76`): the same branch-kept store for ANY
      // directory declaring `storage.keyedBy: "tip"`. Harness-level for the
      // same reason as `qa-store` — it reads the declaration and git, and no
      // folio's subject matter could make it answer differently.
      // Its session-start step (bean `2h76` part 4): fetches the declared state
      // branch and checks it out as a read surface. Harness-level for the same
      // reason as the three above.
      // The seeds' own freshness check (bean `9ofm`): it reads each special
      // branch's `manifest.json`, resolves the ref that manifest names, and
      // compares the two TREES. Harness-level for the same reason as its
      // neighbours, and one more: the branches it reads are the ones the
      // instances' declarations name (special-branches.json is gone, owner
      // 2026-10-05) — a folio's subject matter cannot change what a tree
      // comparison concludes.
      // What every reader of a moved graph needs, written once (bean `9ofm`
      // row D): given a declared directory id, which directory to actually
      // read — the checkout, the mount, or a refusal. Harness-level for the
      // same reason as its neighbours: it reads the declaration, git and the
      // mount marker, and no folio's subject matter could make it resolve
      // differently — only give it more directories to resolve.
      // Its clean-merge counterpart, and harness-level for the same reason: it
      // loads the GATE SET from the workflow and re-runs whichever writers
      // their checks report stale. It knows nothing about any folio's subject
      // matter — a folio could not make it repair differently, only give it
      // more gates.
      // The merge step that calls it, and harness-level for the same reason:
      // it classifies conflicted PATHS against declared patterns and proves
      // the result through `regen`. A folio could not make it resolve
      // differently, only give it more generated files (bean `d33q`).
      // The queue's STORE and its command (bean `najo`), harness-level for the
      // same reason as the two above: they read and write the `merge-queue`
      // graph of THIS repository's declaration, through the generic branch
      // store, and a folio could not make either answer differently — only
      // record more decisions. The store is the reader (four states, and a
      // throw rather than an empty queue for the one that cannot be reached);
      // the CLI is `merge:queue:read` and `merge:queue:record`.
      // Its tile half, and harness-level for the same reason: it reads every
      // INSTANCE's declaration and the published viewer tree, and asks which
      // harnesses exist and what each one has to look at. Nothing in it is
      // about any folio's subject matter — a folio could not make it answer
      // differently, only add a row.
      // The tile half of a KG subscription (issue #1719): which chosen harnesses
      // are instantiated at the root, read from their snapshots. HARNESS so the
      // tile above may import it; `kg-instantiate.ts` (core) imports it too.
      // Its site half (bean `g8jp`): each subgraph a subscription chose,
      // resolved to the tree held for it. HARNESS for the same reason — the
      // tile above and `mount-instance-docs.ts` / `compose-docs.ts` (all
      // harness) import it, and it reads declarations, never folio content.
      // The part LAYOUT both halves share, moved out of `kg-subscribe.ts`
      // (core) so the reader above may import it (bean `g8jp`).
      // Beside its sibling, and HARNESS rather than core — the opposite
      // classification to `gen-default-boards.ts`, for the reason that entry
      // records: what settles it is what a module is ABOUT. That one produces
      // folio content (a board); this one reads instance DECLARATIONS and
      // answers a question about the machinery — which directories an instance
      // says it renders. Its only import is `schemas/kg/cat-harness.ts`, which is
      // harness, so the direction is flat rather than upward.
      //
      // Classified core first, on the reasoning that a tile is something a
      // reader sees. `check:partition` answered with a wrong-direction edge
      // from `sync-docs-harness.ts`, which is harness and calls it — the
      // import was right and the classification was wrong.
      // Same question, same answer: it projects the PLATFORM's own term
      // vocabulary — every class and property hanging off `FOLIO_NS` — and
      // needs no folio to have anything to do.

      // directory holds schemas from all three layers. These four are the
      // harness's own, and classifying them core produced NINE
      // wrong-direction edges out of the harness — the harness importing
      // definitions it owns. Same defect as `lean-packages.ts`, at scale, and
      // the reason a `<graph>/<stub>/` layout would carry the answer in the

      // The theming subgraph's VISUALISER, and core for the same reason as the
      // two above: it reads this instance's declaration to resolve each
      // theme's backdrop, so it must register core's `folio` kind.
      // The reverse of `check-declared-assets` (declared -> disk): this walks

  //
  //    The test applied WAS not "does the name mention Lean" but "would core
  //    compile and function without the science layer installed". For
  //    `lean-packages.ts` it would not: `BlockBase` carries an optional `lean`
  //    field in `schemas/types.ts`, `schemas/constraints.ts` validates its
  //    `ref` against `LEAN_REF_PATTERN`, and the field is on shared block
  //    kinds by design — the document profile forbids its USE rather than its
  //    existence. So the grammar belongs wherever the field does. Only the
  //    package list is a property of a folio, and that is injected.
  //
  //    🟧 THAT TEST IS OVERRULED (owner, 2026-09-27), and it is the premise
  //    rather than the reasoning that was rejected. Verbatim: "field sits on
  //    shared kinds (remark, example, algorithm, simulator), so the grammar
  //    genuinely is vocabulary that goes tp f-a-sci", following
  //    "f-a-sci __should__ have scehams for math/science papers". A `lean`
  //    field appearing on a shared kind does NOT make the grammar core; it
  //    makes that field on those kinds part of the science vocabulary.
  //
  //    The test was applied FIVE times in this block ("Same test again",
  //    "Same test a third time"), so the ruling reached four entries, not one.
  //    Two moved to the sci block above and cost NOTHING. The other two --
  //    `schemas/lean-packages.ts` and `pipeline/lean-signature.ts` --
  //    cost SIX core -> sci edges, measured twice (at `.folio-assistant-pin`
  //    and on current `main`, so not a pin artifact):
  //      schemas/constraints.ts          -> lean-packages

  //      pipeline/qa-utils.ts    -> lean-packages
  //      pipeline/qa-utils.ts    -> lean-signature
  //
  //    🟩 PAID. All six are gone and both modules are now `sci` (they fall
  //    there on the `lean` keyword rule below, so they need no entry at all).
  //    `schemas/formal-ref.ts` is the injection point core reaches instead --
  //    the third instance of the `references-registry-di` / `value-registry-di`
  //    pattern -- and `pipeline/lean-formal-ref.ts` is the sci-side
  //    implementation, which is where the resolution bodies moved verbatim from
  //    `qa-utils.ts`. `BlockBase` is UNCHANGED: core still carries a field
  //    named `lean`, it simply no longer knows the grammar of its `ref`. The
  //    earlier note here said the ruling "changes `BlockBase`, so it is the
  //    owner's call" -- that was wrong, and the whole cost was five call sites,
  //    one of which dissolved by deleting a helper. qou bean `qou-7ko6`.
  //
  //    NOTE: NINE core modules import `lean-packages`, not six. The other
  //    three -- `export-json.ts`, `conjectural-propagation-audit.ts`,
  //    `conditional-class-banner-audit.ts` -- are composition roots
  //    (`import.meta.main`), and `engine.ts` exempts a composition root from
  //    the direction rule while still counting its edge in `totalEdges`. So a
  //    reader who greps importers finds nine; re-measure with `--edges`, and

 * The one edge permitted despite the direction rule.
 *
 * `cat-harness.ts` imports core's `folio-graph-typology.ts` for its side effect,
 * which is what makes the `folio` registration automatic instead of something
 * 110 commands had to remember. Bean `q2wn`, and the header of
 * `schemas/kg/graph-typology-registry.ts` for why the alternatives were worse.
 *
 * ONE entry, naming BOTH endpoints. That is the difference between this and
 * the blanket rule first tried here — "a bare side-effect import is exempt"
 * would have let any harness module reach any core module silently, which is
 * the blindness `q2wn` was opened about wearing a different hat. Any other
 * edge across this boundary still fails.
 *
 * It is a debt and is recorded as one: it exists because the two layers live
 * in one repository (#223). After the split, core is a dependency that
 * registers its own kinds on load and this line goes away.
