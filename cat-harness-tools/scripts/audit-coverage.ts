/**
 * Which audits reach which KIND of node — measured, with denominators.
 *
 * Answers "what audits this kind of node", so that question is not answered
 * from whatever signal is at hand (a sidecar count says nothing about gates).
 * `check:kind-validators` asks whether a kind can be *typed*; this asks who
 * *judges* it. A kind can be typed and audited by nothing. Like that gate, it
 * uses the open registry as the denominator and REPORTS a gap rather than
 * failing.
 *
 * ## Coverage is DECLARED, not inferred
 *
 * A gate names the kinds it covers in its own module docblock:
 *
 *     @covers bean-defs, beans
 *     @covers none — a language-level check, not a graph audit
 *     @covers computed — it sweeps whichever kinds declare `nodeSchemas`
 *
 * Grepping a gate's source for kind names or directories would be wrong both
 * ways (a gate using `directoriesForGraph` names no path at all). An
 * undeclared gate is `undeclared` — counted, printed, never zero;
 * `--require-all` makes that a failure.
 *
 * - **`@covers none`** — the gate has decided it audits no declared graph
 *   (`check:workflows` reads `.github/workflows/`), distinct from not saying.
 * - **`@covers computed`** — the covered set is derived at run time
 *   (`check:kind-validators` walks whichever kinds declare `nodeSchemas`). It
 *   counts as neither coverage nor a gap; that gate reports its own kinds.
 *
 * ## Three states per kind, kept distinguishable
 *
 * 1. **no directory** — no layer declares a directory of this kind (a
 *    nested kind such as `bean-defs` inside `beans/`, or one this layer
 *    does not have). NOT a gap.
 * 2. **a directory with no files** — a determined empty.
 * 3. **files, and no criterion and no gate reaching them** — the finding.
 *
 * Every row prints all four counts and names its state. A declared directory
 * absent from the checkout is `unknown`.
 *
 * ## The record holds COVERAGE; the census is printed
 *
 * `files` and `sidecars` are printed, not written to the sidecar: they move
 * on any commit that adds a file. The sidecar records the coverage relation —
 * declared directories, criteria reaching the kind, gates declaring it, and
 * the resulting state — plus `hasFiles`, the one census fact the states need.
 * `files` counts files (excluding QA sidecars and dot-prefixed paths), not
 * nodes; only a kind's own validator knows which files are nodes.
 *
 * ## What `--check` fails on
 *
 * `--check` fails on a finding that is **NEW** against a baseline (a kind
 * that lost its audit, a gate that stopped declaring). Standing findings are
 * reported and do not fail; `--strict` fails on them too. The baseline is the
 * working copy, or `--against <ref>` (a `qa-reports` ref); a baseline that is
 * not there is UNKNOWN — reported, never a pass, never a failure.
 *
 * `--check` does NOT write: a checker that repairs what it reports cannot
 * fail twice.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat audit:coverage                 # print the report, write the sidecar
 *   bun run cat audit:coverage --check         # judge, write nothing; fail on a NEW finding
 *   bun run cat audit:coverage --check --against main   # ...new against the qa-reports branch
 *   bun run cat audit:coverage --strict        # ...and fail on a kind nothing JUDGES
 *                                          #    (unaudited or typed-only alike)
 *   bun run cat audit:coverage --require-all   # ...and on any gate that has not declared
 *
 * @module scripts/audit-coverage
 * @covers none — it measures coverage rather than auditing a graph; a row about
 *   itself would be a criterion that cannot fail.

/**
 * {@link census} over several directories, and the two reasons one is not

 *
 * A directory declaring `storage.branch` (bean `16ei`) keeps its files on that
 * branch. What that means for the census depends on the **keying**, and bean
 * `9ofm` measured the cost of treating the two alike:
 *
 * - **`commit`**-keyed (qa-store's layout) — what sits at the path in the
 *   checkout is a working copy whose size depends on whether `qa:fetch` ran.
 *   Counting it would make this report a measurement of the contributor's last
 *   command, so it is skipped and counted in `stored`.
 * - a branch **TIP** — the mount is deterministic, so there IS a right answer.
 *   Mounted, it is censused at the marker's `into` like any other directory:
 *   these are real files, and 1,389 beans dropping out of the census the day a
 *   declaration flipped would be a silent loss of the whole work plan from
 *   this report. Not mounted, it is `undetermined` — never folded into
 *   `stored`, because `stored` means "not where the files are, by design" and
 *   this means "could not read the files", and a caller that cannot tell those
 *   apart will read a lower bound as a measurement.
 *
 * - **`route`**-keyed — there is no route store to census: `state-mount.ts` walks
 *   tip-keyed entries only, so no mount of one ever exists locally and no amount
 *   of fetching produces a path for `census` to walk. Cut over, that is `stored`
 *   and the statement is true. **Not** cut over, it is `undetermined` like a
 *   not-cut-over tip, because `stored` asserts the files are elsewhere by design
 *   and during that window they are tracked right here — a true-sounding bucket
 *   holding a false claim is worse than the honest "could not read".
 *
 * `uncounted` is the third answer (bean `0dav`, C8): a directory that is NOT
 * stored, not tip-keyed, and not in the checkout either. Its zero is not a
 * measurement, so it is counted apart and a caller can tell "examined, empty"
 * from "not here".
 *
 * So `stored` tells "all stored" from "all empty", and `undetermined` tells
 * both from "could not say".
 *
 * @param repoRoot the checkout a tip mount is resolved against. Only read for
 *   tip-keyed directories, so a caller with none needs no git repository.

  // `main` (owner rulings D1/D4), so the gate would have been red on every
  // run for a reason that is nobody's defect. Now:
  //
  // - `--strict` fails on every kind nothing reaches or nothing judges, and
  //   `--require-all` on every undeclared gate — as before.
  // - plain `--check` fails on what is NEW in those three families against a
  //   baseline: the committed working copy today, `--against <ref>` on the
  //   `qa-reports` branch after the move. That is what "stale" used to catch
  //   and the only part of it that was ever a finding.
  // - a missing baseline, and a kind with no census, are UNKNOWN: printed,
  //   never a pass, never a failure (proposal §2.3).
  //
  // The LAYER root, not the repository root: `check:undeclared-files`
  // caught the first version writing to `<repo>/test/results/`, a directory no
  // declaration names — the `dh4f` defect, committed by the script whose whole
  // subject is coverage.
