/**
 * Enumerate a repository's files the way a GATE needs to see them.
 *
 * @module scripts/repo-files
 *
 * ## Tracked ∪ untracked-but-not-ignored
 *
 * `git ls-files <tree>` lists **tracked** files only, so a gate built on it
 * cannot see a file created and not yet committed — the file most likely to
 * break its rule — and passes locally while CI fails.
 *
 * `--others --exclude-standard` is the second half; `--exclude-standard`
 * honours `.gitignore`, so `node_modules/`, build output and local scratch
 * stay out while new work comes in.
 *
 * **Deleted-but-still-tracked files are excluded.** `ls-files` lists a file
 * the working tree no longer has, and a gate reading one would fail on
 * content nobody can fix from here.
 *
 * ## When tracked-only is the RIGHT question
 *
 * Keep `ls-files` when the question is literally "what is committed" — e.g.
 * `scripts/tests/lean-projects.test.ts` asks whether `.lake/` is *tracked*.
 * Use this module when the question is "what source is in this tree".

/**
 * A TypeScript source with its comments removed, string literals intact.
 *
 * **For gates that assert about CODE and keep tripping over prose.** A check
 * that greps a whole file cannot tell an implementation from a comment
 * describing one — `manifest-remote-resolution.test.ts` records exactly that:
 * *"Grepping for `shallow-clone` was the first attempt and is not evidence: it
 * cannot tell an implementation from a comment, and it flagged the comment
 * this very change added."* Its own sibling assertions then kept the naive
 * form, and a documentation comment naming a directory tripped them.
 *
 * Tightening the pattern to quoted strings is not enough on its own, because
 * a markdown code span in a comment is delimited by backticks and backticks
 * quote strings in TypeScript. The comment has to go first.
 *
 * **String literals are skipped rather than stripped**, which is the whole
 * difficulty: a naive `//`-to-end-of-line rule cuts `"https://example.com"` in
 * half and invents a finding. Template-literal `${…}` is treated as ordinary
 * literal text — a comment inside an interpolation is vanishingly rare and
 * mis-keeping one is harmless here, whereas mis-cutting a URL is not.
