/**
 * THE DIRECTORIES AN UPSTREAM LAYER DECLARES AT A PIN — its own entries and
 * the ones it declares FROM WITHIN them — read from a {@link RemoteTree}
 * without checking the layer out.
 *
 * @module scripts/upstream-directories
 * @graphNode none — a library: it reads declarations at a pin and judges nothing
 *
 * A remote mount (and anything else naming a subgraph of a layer it has
 * not got) needs the id → path map of the layer AT THE PIN. The top-level
 * `directories` of `<name>.json` are only half of it: an entry declared from
 * within (`skills/skills.json` naming `voices/`; `"subgraph": true`) is a
 * layer directory too, so a reader of only the top-level list would refuse
 * a nested id as "not declared".
 *
 * It does not walk the nesting itself. It checks out the declaration files
 * only — `<name>.json` and every file a known kind names as its
 * `declarationFile` — in one sparse checkout, and hands that skeleton to
 * cat-harness's `instanceDirectories`, so the remote answer and the on-disk
 * answer come from one resolver.
 *
 * What it cannot see, it says: a declaration this checkout's schema or kind
 * registry cannot read (a kind contributed by a layer not mounted here yet)
 * is `{ ok: false, detail }`, never an empty list read as "declares nothing
 * from within".
