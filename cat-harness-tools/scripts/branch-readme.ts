/**
 * Every special branch's README, RENDERED from what declares it.
 *
 * A hand-written README drifts from the facts it restates, so this renders
 * one from two KG sources:
 *
 * - the **declaration** — every instance directory whose `storage`/`source`
 *   names the branch, with its id, path, graph typologies and description.
 *   Each harness (or instance) declares its own; this reads the declarations
 *   where they are, never a central table of branches;
 * - the branch's own root **`manifest.json`** (`state-manifest/v1`, schema in
 *   `@litlfred/cat-harness/schemas/kg/state-manifest.ts`) — status, the seed
 *   commit, when, the writer and gate of a rendered branch.
 *
 * Status, provenance and write discipline are what tell a live branch from an
 * abandoned one.
 *
 * ## Families
 *
 * A `branchPrefix` declaration names a family, one branch per key, and the
 * members are not known until a key is published. **Each member carries its
 * own README**, rendered from the family's declaration and the member's own
 * manifest. This command lists a family as `family` and does not enumerate
 * its members.
 *
 * ## Three states
 *
 * `--check` reports a branch `current`, `stale` (README absent or different
 * from the rendering), or `unknown` (the branch or its manifest could not be
 * read, or the manifest does not parse). Unknown exits 2, stale exits 1.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat branch:readme --check              every declared branch
 *   bun run cat branch:readme --print <branch>     the rendering, to stdout
 *   bun run cat branch:readme --push <branch>      replace the branch's README (a describing write)
 *
 * @module scripts/branch-readme
