/**
 * The per-writer output cache and the bounded parallel scheduler of
 * `derive:publish`.
 *
 * @module scripts/derive-cache
 * @graphNode none — a helper of `derive-at-publish.ts`; it judges no graph
 *
 * When nothing a publish-time writer reads has changed since it last ran
 * green here, `derive:publish` RESTORES the bytes it wrote then and reports
 * `reused <writer> (inputs unchanged since <key>)` — never as built.
 *
 * ## The key
 *
 * A writer's key is a hash over:
 *
 * - its input-hash fingerprint (`input-hash.ts`): its script closure, AUDITED
 *   for every environment, network, clock and git read (`input-sites.ts`), the
 *   `bun` and `git` versions, `bun.lock`, and its declared inputs. A writer
 *   declares inputs the way a check does, in `task-io.ts` or its instance's
 *   `taskIo`; one that declares none is keyed on `{tracked}` — the WHOLE
 *   working tree, since inputs are declared or derived, never hand-narrowed
 *   globs (`ci-cone.ts`). It costs hits, never correctness.
 * - the content of the DECLARED outputs of every writer ordered before it
 *   ({@link predecessorsOf}), as they stand when it starts.
 *
 * The tree digest leaves out every declared `builtAtPublish` path (what each
 * run rewrites), and `build/`, where this cache lives (`BUILD_OUTPUT_DIRS`).
 * A fingerprint that cannot be determined — an unannotated network read, a
 * dirty submodule — makes the writer RUN: could-not-determine is never clean.
 *
 * ## Recorded only over a tree that held still
 *
 * Like `recordCheckRun` in `input-hash.ts`, a result is recorded only when the
 * tree digest after the whole run equals the one the keys were computed over:
 * a writer that leaves an undeclared file outside `build/`, or a person
 * editing during the run, records nothing that run. Snapshots are staged and
 * committed at the end, so a discarded run leaves the cache as it was.
 *
 * ## Order and parallelism
 *
 * The declared edges (`writerEdges` in `derive-at-publish.ts`) are the whole
 * order. {@link schedule} starts a writer once every writer with an edge into
 * it has finished, at most `CAT_DERIVE_JOBS` at once (default: the machine's
 * cores), ties broken by the sequential order. With one job it runs exactly
 * the sequential order.
 *
 * ## Where, and when it is off
 *
 * `CAT_DERIVE_CACHE_DIR`, default `build/derive-cache` (git-ignored). Off
 * under `--no-cache`, and under `CI` unless `CAT_DERIVE_CACHE_DIR` is set (a
 * workflow opts in by naming a cache directory it restores).
