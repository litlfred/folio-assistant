/**
 * state-mount — put the state branch on disk, or say loudly that it is not there.
 *
 * @module scripts/state-mount
 * @graphNode none — a session-start step over a declared `storage` directory
 * @covers none — it MAKES graphs readable and judges none of them. It runs as
 * a gate in `code-quality-gates.yml` before the bean gates, but claiming
 * `beans` coverage would let the gates that actually judge the store be
 * removed without the census noticing.
 *
 * The session-start hook calls this; it is also `bun run cat state:mount` by
 * hand.
 *
 * ## Every failure is LOUD
 *
 * An empty work-plan and an unreachable work-plan look identical to an agent.
 * So every failure here is a non-zero exit and a block on stdout — the hook's
 * stdout IS the agent's context — that says in as many words that an empty
 * `beans list` must not be believed.
 *
 * ## A branch PER GRAPH
 *
 * Each declared tip-keyed directory lives on the branch ITS OWN declaration
 * names, and is mounted at ITS OWN declared path. This module contributes only
 * the FAN-OUT: every mount is {@link mountTip}'s (`branch-store.ts`, reached
 * by hand as `branch-store.ts mount --id <directory-id>`), which round-trips
 * bytes, modes and symlinks and keeps a per-worktree marker. `beans` reads
 * `beans/defs` off a disk, and a mount at the declared path serves it.
 *
 * ## Which graphs: the RESOLVED source
 *
 * {@link tipLocations} reads each declaration's resolved source — a config
 * override, then `source`, then the legacy `storage` — so a graph declared
 * `source: { kind: "branch", keyedBy: "tip" }` is mounted, a `directory`
 * source is the checkout itself, and a `commit`-keyed branch is qa-store's,
 * not a mount's.
 *
 * ## It is inert until the cutover, and that is not a failure
 *
 * While no declaration keeps a graph at a branch tip, {@link tipLocations} is
 * empty and this reports `not-enabled` and exits 0, so the loud case stays
 * meaningful.
 *
 * ## It never discards work
 *
 * A mount holding unpushed edits is left exactly as it is and reported
 * `stale`, never re-read over. `stale` is NOT a failure: the graph is still on
 * disk and readable.
 *
 * ## One graph failing must not let the others read clean
 *
 * The aggregate keeps three answers apart — every graph mounted, SOME mounted
 * and these named ones did not, and "could not determine". A failing graph
 * never stops its siblings being mounted, and the process exits non-zero when
 * anything failed, because `session-start-coord-sweep.sh` calls this with
 * `|| true` and the printed block and the exit status are then the only
 * carriers of the finding.
