/**
 * check-graph-typology-work.ts — every `state` graph typology has said whether it
 * records WORK.
 *
 * `recordsWork` answers the question an arriving agent asks first: is there
 * something here somebody is partway through, that I could pick up? The
 * root README's cold-start section computes its ACTIVE/STATIC verdict from
 * it, so a kind that has not decided makes that verdict quietly wrong. Not
 * all live state is work: an ingestion queue such as `uploads` is state
 * nobody is partway through.
 *
 * ## Why a gate rather than a required field
 *
 * `renderable` and `holds` are required on {@link GraphTypologyDef}, so a kind
 * cannot compile without deciding them. `recordsWork` is **optional in the
 * type on purpose**: it is meaningless for `content`, `context` and
 * `derived` — a record of what the instance IS records no position. So the
 * "cannot ship undecided" property lives here, narrowed to the `state` layer.
 *
