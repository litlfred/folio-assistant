/**
 * state-seed — REFRESH a seeded state branch from the ref it says it was
 * seeded from, and verify that it landed.
 *
 * @module scripts/state-seed
 * @covers beans
 * @covers todos
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run state:seed --id beans              # refresh the seed, verify, report
 * bun run state:seed --id beans --dry-run    # what it would push, pushing nothing
 * bun run state:seed --id beans --authoritative   # the CUTOVER half: the branch becomes the store
 * bun run state:seed --retire <root> --into <host instance> --repository <url> \\
 *   --also <root>.config.json                  # SEPARATION: a whole instance, into the host's fsh-guts
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why this exists — `state:drift`'s remedy had no implementation
 *
 * `state-drift.ts` (bean `9ofm` row C) ends every drifted run with *"Refresh
 * the seed before any cutover"*, and nothing in the repository refreshed one.
 * Both refreshes so far were hand-run git plumbing recorded in a bean body
 * (bean `2h76`, 2026-10-02 and 2026-10-03), and the second was needed because
 * the first had gone **173 commits and 14 files** stale with nothing saying so.
 * A remedy a gate names but no command performs is a remedy that gets
 * improvised differently every time, and a hand-spliced tree is unverifiable
 * after the fact: the cutover replaces the whole subtree in one commit, so
 * there is no diff left to read.
 *
 * What a cutover from a stale seed does is worse than failing. It **resurrects**
 * whatever the seed still holds and **loses** whatever landed on the source ref
 * since — silently, because the branch is perfectly well-formed either way.
 *
 * ## Keyed by the SPECIAL-BRANCH row, not by the declared directory
 *
 * `branch-store mount --id` and `push --id` are keyed by DIRECTORY id (the
 * owner's 2026-10-03 ruling: one generic pair for beans, todos and fsh-guts
 * alike), and this is deliberately keyed by the observed row id (the retired `special-branches.json` used the same ids)
 * instead — the same key `state:drift` uses. The reason is the state this
 * command exists for: before a cutover the directory's declaration still says
 * `source: { kind: "directory" }`, so `resolveTipLocation` refuses it, and a
 * refresh keyed off the declaration would be unavailable in exactly the
 * pre-cutover window it is for. The ids coincide for every state branch today
 * (`beans`, `todos`, `fsh-guts`), so this is a different KEY rather than a
 * different name.
 *
 * Which paths to copy is read from the branch's own `manifest.json`
 * (`graphs[].path`, or the older `subgraph`), and the source ref from its
 * `source.ref`. Both are read rather than assumed: a seed that records another
 * ref is refreshed from the ref it claims, and a seed that records none is a
 * refusal rather than a guess at `main`.
 *
 * ## It refuses the two states where a refresh would destroy work
 *
 * - `authoritative: true` — the branch IS the store. Copying `main` over it
 *   would overwrite every edit made since the cutover with a stale copy of a
 *   directory `main` no longer even tracks.
 * - `status: "retired"` — a superseded seed (`cat/cat-harness/state`, owner
 *   ruling D4 (b)). Refreshing it would make a branch nothing should read look
 *   current, which is how a cutover tool picks the wrong one.
 *
 * Both are `refused` (exit 5), never a silent no-op, because "nothing to do"
 * and "I declined to do this" are different answers to a caller.
 *
 * ## `--authoritative` is the cutover's branch half, and it is one-way
 *
 * The cutover is one commit on `main` (the declaration, the `git rm`, the
 * `.gitignore`) and one push to the branch (the current content, plus
 * `authoritative: true`). This performs the second half. Afterwards this
 * command refuses the branch, by the rule above — which is what makes the flag
 * one-way rather than a mode.
 *
 * ## Why it does not go through {@link BranchStore.write}
 *
 * `write()` is blob-keyed: it takes a list of file contents, and it REFUSES
 * `manifest.json` because that file describes the branch rather than the
 * subgraph. A refresh is the one write that must replace a whole SUBTREE (1442
 * files for `beans`) and rewrite the manifest. So it splices trees with the
 * same plumbing and the same discipline — `commit-tree -p tip`, push without
 * `-f`, the server's ref lock as the concurrency primitive — rather than
 * widening `write()` into two shapes.
 *
 * ## `--cutover` is the MAIN half, and it never pushes (bean `hp54`)
 *
 * After `--authoritative`, the cutover still needed a hand-run `git rm -r`,
 * a `.gitignore` line and a commit — measured 2026-10-06 cutting a folio's
 * `beans/` and `todos/` over. {@link cutoverMain} is that half. It REFUSES
 * unless:
 *
 * - the branch's manifest says `authoritative: true` (the branch is the store);
 * - the directory is declared on that branch (`source` / `storage`, read
 *   through `tipLocations`) — flipping the declaration and removing the files
 *   are one change (bean `9ofm`), so the declaration comes first;
 * - the checkout has no uncommitted change under the path;
 * - `HEAD:<path>` and the branch's `<path>` are the SAME tree id — byte-
 *   identical, every file, mode and name, so nothing is removed from `main`
 *   that the branch does not hold.
 *
 * - the directory's OWN instance declares a `fsh-guts` graph kept at a branch
 *   tip, and the snapshot DEPOSIT into it succeeds and re-reads verified
 *   (§"The deposit", below). No trashcan, or a deposit that did not land, is
 *   a refusal with main untouched.
 *
 * It is a DRY RUN unless `--commit` is passed: it reports the files and bytes
 * it would remove and the deposit it would make. With `--commit` it first
 * deposits, then stages `git rm -r <path>` and a
 * `/<path>/**` ignore line (the `/fsh-guts/**` precedent: a mount must never be
 * committed) as ONE commit naming the branch and the tree id. It never pushes —
 * the caller reviews and pushes. `deletion-requires-confirmation`: the dry run
 * is the report, `--commit` is the person saying go.
 *
 * ## Which repository — the cwd's, not the platform's (bean `hp54`)
 *
 * Every default here resolves through `defaultRepoRoot()`: the git toplevel of
 * the directory the command is run from. It used to be the platform checkout
 * unconditionally, so a folio linking the platform as a submodule refreshed
 * the PLATFORM's branch. `--repo-root <dir>` overrides it.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 refreshed or already current (or cut over / would cut over)
 * · 1 pushed and still not verified · 4 could not determine · 5 refused.

/**
 * Owner, 2026-10-06: *"cutover dirs should go to fsh-guts"*.
 *
 * The cutover's main half removes a directory from `main`. Its content is not
 * lost — the authoritative branch holds it, byte-identical, which is the
 * refusal condition above — but the `main` copy as it stood at the moment of
 * removal stops being reachable from anything but history. `fsh-guts` is the
 * repository's answer to "removed, but kept": so the removal DEPOSITS a
 * snapshot there before it is made.
 *
 * ## The item is the existing `retired/` pair, not a new format
 *
 * `fsh-guts/retired/bootstrap-split.{md,tar.gz}` is the precedent: a packed
 * archive, so the scanners that read every file in the checkout do not take
 * the copies for live files (a loose copy of `beans/` would be a second bean
 * store to every reader that walks a directory), plus a same-basename `.md`
 * declaring itself `folio-fsh-guts/v1` with `movedFrom` / `movedOn`. This adds
 * the cutover's provenance as passthrough fields — the schema is
 * `.passthrough()` precisely so an open `kind` keeps what makes it distinct.
 *
 * ## The writer is `branch-store`, as for every other fsh-guts write
 *
 * The trashcan is itself a tip-keyed branch, so the deposit is one
 * {@link BranchStore.write}: spliced onto the tip, pushed without `-f`, and
 * `expect: null` on both paths, so an existing item of the same name is a
 * `conflict` rather than an overwrite.

/**
 * ## `--retire <path> --into <instance>` — separating a whole instance

 * A cutover moves one DIRECTORY of an instance onto that instance's own state
 * branch. Separation moves a whole INSTANCE ROOT out of the repository into
 * its own (stage 13 of `sub-kg-lifecycle`), so neither half of `--cutover`
 * fits: there is no tip-keyed branch the path is kept on — the live copy is
 * another repository — and the trashcan is not the instance's own, because
 * that instance is the thing leaving. It is the instance named by `--into`:
 * the host that keeps the frozen copy.
 *
 * It REFUSES unless `<path>` is an instance root (it carries a declaration),
 * `--into` names a different instance under the same checkout whose
 * `fsh-guts` graph is kept at a branch tip, `--repository` answers
 * `git ls-remote`, and nothing under the paths is uncommitted. The deposit is
 * one archive of every path at HEAD — the root and each `--also` file beside
 * it, such as its `.config.json` — checked to extract to exactly the tree
 * and blob ids HEAD holds, plus a `separated-instance` note carrying the four
 * stage-13 fields. Only once the deposit is re-read from the tip does
 * `--commit` stage the `git rm` as one commit. Never pushes, like `--cutover`.
 *
 * `matchesCommit` is the HOST commit the copy was taken at, the meaning the
 * first separation's notes gave it. The live repository's layout is its own
 * (the forks nest and rename), so the copy is NOT compared to it: the note
 * records the repository's tip at the time and says the comparison was not
 * made, rather than implying one.
