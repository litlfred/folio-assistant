/**
 * What a built site WEARS, measured on its pages, and what a candidate lacks
 * that the site it would replace has.
 *
 * @module scripts/site-parity
 * @covers none — a publish guard: it compares two built sites and judges no graph
 *
 * Before a root publish the candidate is measured against the root it would
 * replace, on the PAGES, never on the exit codes of the steps that made them:
 *
 * - the theme's side bar (`#site-nav`) and a search box (`#search-input`),
 *   which a page Jekyll laid out with just-the-docs carries, and which an IG
 *   site's own search box carries too (the FHIR IG harness's `ig-search.ts`);
 * - the language picker's block (`#fa-translation-meta`), from which docs-ui
 *   draws the language picker at the top of the page;
 * - the harness icon row (`#fa-navbar-row`) and the rail (`nav.fa-nav`, or the
 *   theme's `#site-nav`, which is where the rail sits on a laid-out page);
 * - every top-level directory (`openapi/`, `fhir-artifact-index/`, `ast-data/`,
 *   …): `folio-site.yml`'s `publish-served` step and its copies;
 * - the build stamp `folio-build.json` (`site-build-stamp.ts stamp`).
 *
 * A feature the current root carries on at least one page and the candidate
 * carries on none, or carries on its `index.html` and the candidate's
 * `index.html` does not, is a SHORTFALL; so is a directory or the stamp that
 * the current root has and the candidate lacks. Directories the publish keeps
 * (previews under `branches/`, `branches/`) are not the candidate's to carry
 * and are left out of both sides.
 *
 * ## Directories and features dropped by a ruling
 *
 * A directory or page feature the owner ruled is no longer published is not
 * a shortfall, but only when the caller names it in a {@link DroppedByRuling}
 * with the ruling's own words. An entry names EITHER top-level directory
 * names (a `*` glob) OR one page feature, by its key in {@link PAGE_FEATURES},
 * and excuses exactly that — never a missing `index.html` or the stamp. What
 * it excuses is said, never silent ({@link droppedByRuling}). Example: an IG
 * site whose folio rail stands in for the theme's side menu drops
 * `#site-nav`, while the search box and the rail stay required.
