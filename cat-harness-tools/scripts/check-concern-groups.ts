/**
 * Concern groups are declared from within, drawn from one code list, declared
 * once, and inherited as members (placement PR0c, bean `ejye`; bean `9umr`).
 *
 * @module scripts/check-concern-groups
 * @covers cat-harness
 *
 * For every grouping kind ({@link groupingKinds}: skills, processes, schemas,
 * library, uml, code) and every directory of it in the checkout:
 *
 * 1. **The declaration file parses and every group it names exists** — a
 *    declared-but-absent group is the `dh4f` defect, a consumer scanning
 *    nothing and reporting a clean run over it.
 * 2. **Every group is a code of `code-lists/concern-group.json`.** The eight
 *    groups are one vocabulary across every instance and every kind; a code
 *    invented in one declaration is a ninth group nobody ruled on. One
 *    pre-existing exception is BASELINED, with its retirement named: the
 *    harness's skills topic `authoring`, which PR2 regroups under `content`.
 *    The baseline only shrinks — an entry that no longer occurs is a finding,
 *    so it cannot outlive its reason.
 * 3. **A group is declared once.** A higher instance whose same-named
 *    directory REDECLARES a group the harness declared is adding a group of
 *    its own; under option A its directory is already a member.
 *
 * Prints each group with its members, so "core's `skills/library/` is a
 * member of the harness's `library` group" is a line a reviewer can read.
