/**
 * derive:publish — build every derived artefact that cannot be current in a
 * commit, at the moment the site is built.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/derive-at-publish
 * @covers none — it runs the writers `check:derived-from` names; it judges no graph
 *
 * ## Branch-derived artefacts
 *
 * An artefact derived from an input kept on a BRANCH goes stale without a
 * commit, so it is never committed: `check:derived-from` finds those by
 * walking `derivedFrom` edges up to a branch-kept input (a visualisation
 * counts as derived from the directory it shows) and refuses any that is
 * tracked. The site build runs this after `state:mount` and before composing
 * the site, and it runs each one's declared `writer`, sources before
 * consumers.
 *
 * ## Artefacts a layer declares it builds at publish
 *
 * A layer's `builtAtPublish` (`schemas/kg/built-at-publish.ts`) lists
 * artefacts no commit of it can hold current — computed over the checkout's
 * other layers (`checkout`), or from a branch-kept graph (`state`) — and
 * names each one's writer as a package script. After the branch-derived
 * artefacts, this runs every such writer once, in the order {@link writersOf}
 * works out (see "Writer order"), and then REFUSES an entry that came out
 * missing or empty. `--cause state` runs only the state-derived ones (what an
 * e2e job reading the beans and todos projections needs after `state:mount`).
 * No list of generators lives here or in a workflow.
 *
 * ## Refusals, not silence
 *
 * A writer that exits non-zero fails the step, naming it — after every other
 * declared writer has run, so one run names every failure. A writer refuses an
 * unmounted graph (exit 2), so a build that forgot `state:mount` fails here.
 *
 * A writer that exits `NOT_APPLICABLE_EXIT` (78, `lib/not-applicable.ts`) has
 * said, with a reason, that THIS root cannot build its artefact (`uml:overview`
 * needs the gates workflow, which a document folio lacks). It is reported
 * SKIPPED with its reason, the artefacts that name it are excused from the
 * built-or-refused check (and listed), and the step does not fail on it. Only
 * the writer can say so; no list of writers or roots lives here.
 *
 * ## Writer order: lowest layer first, plus the edges the declarations state
 *
 * The base order is the layers' dependency order (lowest layer first, a
 * function of the declared `needs` alone), each layer's entries in their
 * declared order, and a writer named by several entries runs ONCE. On top of
 * that, two kinds of hard edge, both read from the declarations:
 *
 * - a layer's own declared order: each of its writers runs after the one
 *   it lists before it (`processes:viz` after `render:bpmn`, `navbar:include`
 *   after the `docs:harness` whose `harness.json` it renders). A route
 *   derived from a `builtOnHostSite` visualiser is not listed by its host and
 *   adds no such edge; a harness's host-site viewers run in the order it
 *   declares them;
 * - a READ EDGE (`reads` on an entry, `schemas/kg/built-at-publish.ts` in
 *   cat-harness): the entry's writers run after the writers of every OTHER
 *   layer's entry that fills (`directory`) a directory of one of those
 *   kinds. For example cat-harness's `docs/_data/harness.json` declares
 *   `reads: ["docs"]`, because it links an IG only when that IG's `docs/`
 *   exists.
 *
 * The sort is stable (a writer runs as early as its edges allow, ties broken
 * by first mention), and a cycle is REFUSED, naming the writers in it.
 *
 * ## Reuse and parallelism
 *
 * Each declared writer is keyed (`derive-cache.ts`: its input-hash
 * fingerprint plus its predecessors' outputs), and a writer whose key has a
 * recorded result is RESTORED from `CAT_DERIVE_CACHE_DIR` (default
 * `build/derive-cache`) and reported `reused <writer> (inputs unchanged since
 * <key>)` — never as built. Writers the declared edges leave unordered run at
 * once, at most `CAT_DERIVE_JOBS` (default: the cores); with
 * `CAT_DERIVE_JOBS=1` it is the sequential order above, output unbuffered.
 * `--no-cache` turns reuse off; so does `CI`, unless `CAT_DERIVE_CACHE_DIR`
 * opts in.
 *
 * ```
 * bun run cat derive:publish            # run every writer
 * bun run cat derive:publish --list     # print what would run, run nothing
 * bun run cat derive:publish --no-cache # run every writer, reuse nothing
 * ```
