/**
 * Render BPMN 2.0 sources to standalone SVG.
 *
 * The `.bpmn` files under `processes/` are the source of truth — plain BPMN
 * 2.0 with diagram interchange, so any BPMN tool opens them. This script
 * renders them to SVG for the docs site and for GitHub's Markdown renderer.
 *
 * Usage:  bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/render-bpmn.ts [--check]
 *
 * `--check` renders to memory and fails if a committed beside-source SVG is
 * stale; the site copy is built at publish and is not judged.
 *
 * Never hand-edit `docs/assets/img/workflows/*.svg` — regenerate instead.
 *
 * The drawing itself (bpmn-js in headless Chromium, byte-stable and
 * responsive) is bootstrap-tools'
 * `scripts/render-bpmn.ts`. This is the SITE half: every layer's
 * diagrams, into this site's `workflows/`, with each step's title linking to
 * its page and each call activity's [+] to the process it calls
 * (`src/workflow/diagram-links.ts`).
 *
 * @covers processes, business-processes — it draws both kinds' diagrams (a folio block brings its own SVG)
 *
 * @conformsTo omg-bpmn-2.0
 * @conformsTo omg-dd-1.0
