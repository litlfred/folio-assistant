/**
 * Which open PRs' bean edits must LAND before `beans/` can leave `main`, and
 * which can simply be PORTED to `cat/cat-harness/beans` instead?
 *
 * @module scripts/bean-rollover
 * @graphNode none — a read-only report over git and the open PRs
 * @covers none — a merge-steward report: it inventories, it judges no declared graph
 *
 * ## The question, and why a count alone does not answer it
 *
 * Issue #1850 step 2 is *"land or park the PRs that change beans"*. Measured
 * with `merge:overlap` on 2026-10-02 that is **29 of 33 open PRs and 110
 * authored bean touches**, which reads as "clear the board" — weeks of merging
 * before the freeze in step 3 can even be scheduled.
 *
 * But "touches `beans/`" is three different situations wearing one number:
 *
 *   - a generated region (`beans/README.md`'s file COUNT) that is regenerated
 *     and needs nothing;
 *   - a bean whose edit `main` already carries, so the PR differs only because
 *     `main` moved on;
 *   - a bean that exists only on that PR — usually the session's own handover
 *     bean — which can be copied onto the beans branch without that PR landing
 *     at all.
 *
 * Only the last group is work, and only a group that BOTH sides edited needs a
 * person. This separates them, so the owner can schedule step 2 against a real
 * number instead of 110.
 *
 * ## Five states per authored bean path, and the fifth is never clean
 *
 * | state | meaning |
 * |---|---|
 * | `already-on-main` | the PR's version matches the base, or its patch applies in reverse to the base — the base has the change |
 * | `port` | the base has not touched this bean since the fork point, so the PR's version can be copied onto the beans branch with nothing to lose |
 * | `port-superset` | both sides touched this bean, but one side is a strict superset once `updated_at` is set aside — portable without human adjudication; carries the superset side and the exact diff |
 * | `adjudicate` | BOTH the PR and the base changed this bean since the fork with divergent edits — a person picks, because either choice drops someone's edit |
 * | `could-not-determine` | git would not answer for this path. **Never reported as portable, never counted clean** |
 *
 * The third state is the one that matters for scheduling and the one a naive
 * tool would fold into the second. Porting over a bean the base also edited
 * silently destroys the base's edit, and a bean id is referenced from commits,
 * issues and other beans, so that loss is not local.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * **It never writes to `cat/cat-harness/beans`.** That branch's own manifest
 * says `status: seed`, `authoritative: false`, and *"main remains the source of
 * truth until arc fs43 migrates every reader and writer; until then this branch
 * is a verified copy, not the store."* A tool that wrote there now would
 * pre-empt steps 3 to 5 of the plan and make the seed diverge from `main` in a
 * direction nothing checks. The port is a steward action, taken after the
 * freeze, against a re-copied seed.
 *
 * It also never deletes or rewrites a bean anywhere. `deletion-requires-confirmation`.
 *
 * ## Reuse, because a second classifier is a second answer
 *
 * `pathClass` and `differsOnlyInRegions` come from `merge-pipeline-paths.ts` —
 * the same functions `merge:overlap` and `merge:train` use, so this cannot
 * disagree with them about what "authored" means. The reverse-patch test for
 * "the base already carries this change" is the technique `merge:leftover`
 * established for its own `landed` verdict.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run beans:rollover                      # every open PR, via gh
 *   bun run beans:rollover -- 1764 1766         # just these
 *   bun run beans:rollover -- --base origin/main --no-fetch
 *   bun run beans:rollover -- --json            # the report on stdout
 *
 * Exit 0 nothing needs porting or adjudicating · 1 some does · 2 could not
 * determine for at least one path, or the PR list could not be read.
