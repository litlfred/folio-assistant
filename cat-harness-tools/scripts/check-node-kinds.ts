/**
 * The node-kind index, written or checked, with a per-layer baseline of
 * unkinded families.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-node-kinds
 * @covers cat-harness, typologies — it resolves every declared family's validator, records which are node kinds, and holds each instance's unkinded families to that instance's own baseline
 *
 *   bun run cat node-kinds                       write every instance's baseline, and cat-harness/docs/_data/node-kinds.json
 *   bun run cat node-kinds:check                 fail on a NEW unkinded family, a stale or foreign baseline entry, or an id collision
 *   bun run cat node-kinds --accept-unkinded     write, admitting new unkinded families to their owners' baselines
 *
 * `kinds` is recomputed from the typologies every run (`nodeKindIndex`). The
 * baseline lists families that predate node kinds: a family unkinded now and
 * not in its owner's baseline is refused by BOTH modes; `--accept-unkinded`
 * is the deliberate override. A family that becomes a node kind leaves the
 * baseline at the next write, and `--check` fails until it is written.
 *
 * A family belongs to the instance that declares its typology
 * (`typologyOwner`). Each instance keeps its baseline in a declared asset of
 * role `unkinded-baseline` (none declared: empty) and is judged against it
 * (`ratchet`). The table `docs/_data/node-kinds.json` is still written for
 * the node-kind pages but is `builtAtPublish`, so `--check` does not compare
 * it. If cat-harness does not declare it built at publish, the committed
 * table is the baseline and `--check` compares its bytes.
