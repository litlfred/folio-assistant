/**
 * Generate cat-harness's JSON Schema, one document per graph typology (kind),
 * from the Zod in `cat-harness-tools/schemas/`.
 *
 * @module scripts/gen-kind-json-schemas
 * @covers schemas
 * @graphNode none — a generator over the harness's kind validators, not a schema itself
 *
 * The Zod lives here; `cat-harness/schemas/` keeps the GENERATED JSON Schema,
 * one per kind, `$id` under the harness's `iriBase`, as bootstrap-tools'
 * `gen-bootstrap-schemas.ts` does for bootstrap: a reader opens it with
 * nothing installed.
 *
 * ## Which kinds, and what each document holds
 *
 * The kinds are the harness's own: every kind of {@link BASE_GRAPH_TYPOLOGIES}
 * and every kind cat-harness declares in its `typologies/` graph. A kind a
 * higher instance declares is that instance's to publish. What a kind's nodes
 * are checked against is what `check:kind-validators` resolves, read through the
 * same functions, so the two cannot disagree about which Zod is the kind's:
 *
 * | the kind declares | the document is |
 * |---|---|
 * | a kind-level validator only | that schema |
 * | `$schema` families | `anyOf` over them: a Zod family is a `$defs` entry keyed by its tag; an external family whose tag is a URL is a `$ref` to it |
 *
 * A family typed only as a TypeScript shape is not runnable, so it constrains
 * nothing here and the document's `$comment` names it. A Zod schema in another
 * repository (bootstrap-tools' `models`) is published by that repository. A kind
 * with nothing runnable gets NO file, and this says why: a schema that accepts
 * everything would read as coverage.
 *
 * ## The same output whatever is mounted beside the harness
 *
 * - **Validator nodes.** A higher instance may answer a harness kind's family
 *   from its own `validators/` graph. The kinds are read from a PRIVATE
 *   registry ({@link harnessRegistry}) that loads the `typologies/` and
 *   `validators/` graphs of the harness and of what it `needs`, transitively,
 *   and of no other instance ({@link harnessInstances}).
 * - **Discovered enums.** `BLOCK_KINDS` is read at import from every mounted
 *   `block-kinds/` graph, an open vocabulary extended by the layers above, so
 *   a schema in a {@link DISCOVERED_VOCABULARIES} entry is written as the open
 *   type `{ "type": "string" }` ({@link body}).
 *
 * `scripts/tests/gen-kind-json-schemas.test.ts` mounts a synthetic higher
 * instance contributing both and asserts the output does not move.
 *
 * ## The `$id` is the file's path
 *
 * `<iriBase>v<major>/<path in cat-harness>`, minted by bootstrap-tools'
 * `releaseIri` from the declaration, never typed; bootstrap-tools'
 * `check:node-iris` enforces it over every Knowledge Graph with an `iriBase`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat kind:json-schemas          # write
 *   bun run cat kind:json-schemas:check    # fail if a kind lacks its file, a file is stale, or an `$id` is not its path
