/**
 * Every declared directory whose graph typology `holds: "state"` is kept OFF
 * `main`, or it is recorded debt that may only go down.
 *
 * @covers cat-harness
 *
 * No kind-level `storage` default is provided: `BranchSourceSchema` requires a
 * `branch`, which a kind cannot supply, so each tip-keyed directory declares
 * its own `source`. (A kind's `newInstanceSource` is a scaffold default read
 * once by `folio_init`; the resolver never reads it.)
 *
 * Ratchet: a baseline that may only SHRINK.
 *
 * - a state directory on `main` that the baseline does not name is a NEW
 *   finding, and fails;
 * - a baseline entry that is no longer on `main` has been cut over, and fails
 *   too, with the instruction to delete the line.
 *
 * `--update` writes the baseline and refuses to grow it without
 * `--allow-growth`. The gate is listed in `regen-after-merge.ts`'s `NO_WRITER`
 * table so that `regen` can never raise the ratchet as a "repair".
 *
 * It asks the DECLARATION, never the disk: `contentIsOffCheckout` is the
 * single predicate, shared with `materialiseDirectories`,
 * `check:declared-dirs` and `audit:coverage`. A checkout where `state:mount`
 * has not run is not a finding, so the gate is safe before the mount step.
