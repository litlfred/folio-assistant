/**
 * Every PUBLISHABLE package in this repository still builds and still passes
 * its own tests — in BOTH languages it ships.
 *
 * The set is DERIVED, never listed here: every `package.json` and every
 * `pyproject.toml` git accounts for, minus the repository root, minus
 * anything `private`. One directory shipping in both ecosystems is TWO
 * entries and two verdicts, since the halves fail independently.
 *
 * Nothing about a runner is hardcoded. A JavaScript half declares its steps
 * as `scripts.build` / `scripts.test`; a Python half declares pytest by
 * carrying `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, and declares its own test
 * dependencies under `[project.optional-dependencies] test`, which is what
 * gets installed. A package that declares neither is REPORTED and skipped.
 * (Python tests run under pytest, not as bare scripts, which would execute
 * no test and exit 0.)
 *
 * **An empty set is a FINDING**, and so is **a missing interpreter**: "no
 * failures" over nothing examined must not read as a pass.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat check:published-packages

 * @covers cat-harness
