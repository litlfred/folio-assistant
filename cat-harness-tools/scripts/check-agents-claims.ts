/**
 * The claims `AGENTS.md` makes ABOUT CODE are checked against the code.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-agents-claims
 * @covers code — its subject is the CODE a prose claim asserts about — the symbols and paths it
 *   names. The `AGENTS.md` it reads is this instance's declared `agent-instructions` asset
 *
 * `check:agents-xref` verifies citations INTO `AGENTS.md`,
 * `check:agent-entry-links` verifies links OUT of it; this reads what the
 * prose ASSERTS.
 *
 * ## Two claim shapes
 *
 * **LOCATION** — `` `symbol` in `module.ts` ``. Catches a symbol renamed or
 * removed while the prose kept its old name.
 *
 * **ABSENCE** — `` `symbol` `` … "has no caller", "nothing calls it", "is not
 * reachable". A stale gap notice is worse than none: an agent that believes
 * it either avoids the feature or rebuilds it.
 *
 * A claim about a config file's CONTENTS is caught by neither, and the report
 * says so.
 *
 * ## It does not grep English
 *
 * Every claim must carry a BACKTICKED symbol and a recognised shape; anything
 * else is counted as **not parsed** and reported as its own state. A sentence
 * the checker did not understand is not a sentence it verified.
 *
 * Usage:  bun run cat check:agents-claims
 * Exit:   0 clean · 1 a claim is false · 2 nothing could be parsed
