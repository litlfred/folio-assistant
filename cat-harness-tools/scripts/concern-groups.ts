/**
 * Concern groups in EVERY grouping kind — skills, processes, schemas,
 * library, uml and the test directories — declared once from within and
 * inherited as members.
 *
 * @module scripts/concern-groups
 * @covers cat-harness
 *
 * A grouping kind's directory names its groups in its own declaration file —
 * `skills/skills.json` (`topics`), `processes/processes.json`,
 * `schemas/schemas.json`, `library/library.json`, `uml/uml.json`, a test
 * directory's `code.json` (`groups`) — by a code from
 * `code-lists/concern-group.json`. A group is declared ONCE, by the lowest
 * instance whose same-named directory declares it, and every higher
 * instance's same-named `<dir>/<group>/` is a MEMBER of it, so a higher
 * instance adds no group of its own. Nesting is declared FROM WITHIN, never
 * by `<instance>.json` reaching down a path.
 *
 * A member sits at the SAME path relative to its own instance as the
 * declaring directory (core's `skills/library/` is a member of the harness's
 * `skills/library/` group), which is why a group's directory is its code.
 *
 * This is the one walker for every kind; `packageDirsIn` delegates here.
