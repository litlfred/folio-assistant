/**
 * Inject the staging banner as a CONSTANT fragment, and put the per-preview
 * facts in one `staging.json` the browser reads. Bean `g196`.
 *
 * ## The problem this exists to fix
 *
 * The banner used to be composed in `feature-staging.yml` as a bash string and
 * `sed`-ed into every page with the commit SHA and a `date -u` build timestamp
 * baked in. Measured on `origin/gh-pages`, 2026-09-19: 9 previews, **346.1 MB**,
 * of which **27.5 MB of each 37.5 MB preview is HTML** — and **zero HTML blobs
 * are shared between any two previews** (git `ls-tree` blob-hash intersection:
 * 0 of ~390 HTML objects, against 185 of ~780 overall, the shared ones being
 * images, fonts and vendor JS).
 *
 * The timestamp is the sharp end. Because it is `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`,
 * **every page is unique even across two builds of ONE branch**, so each
 * re-push adds ~27.5 MB of permanently new objects and the history grows even
 * when the preview count does not. Run 597's log: *"Injected staging banner
 * into 530 HTML files"*.
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * Emit the facts once, to `<site>/staging.json`, and inject a fragment that is
 * **byte-identical on every page and across every rebuild**. The browser
 * derives its preview root from `location.pathname`, fetches the JSON and
 * fills the banner in.
 *
 * This is not a new idea here — `head_custom.html` already records the sidebar
 * QR as *"generated in the browser from `window.location.href` rather than
 * baked per page at build time"*, for the neighbouring reason.
 *
 * ## Why the compare link did not defeat it
 *
 * Exactly one fragment of the old banner was genuinely per-page: the link
 * putting this page beside its counterpart on `main`, which has three states
 * (present on main → deep link; absent → site root, and SAY the page is new;
 * publish ref unread → site root, worded neutrally). That looked like
 * build-time per-page data.
 *
 * It is not. The client knows its own path, and the only thing it cannot
 * compute is *which pages main has* — so `staging.json` carries `newPages`,
 * the pages with **no** counterpart, which is the short list rather than the
 * long one. Membership is then a client-side check and the fragment stays
 * constant. Had this not worked the whole approach would have collapsed to a
 * much smaller saving, so it was the first thing checked.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT fixed here
 *
 * Cause 2 in `g196`: Jekyll's `relative_url` prepends `baseurl` to ~235 hrefs
 * per page. Pages therefore still differ **between** previews by slug. They no
 * longer differ **across rebuilds of one preview**, which is the unbounded
 * half.
 *
 * Cause 3 — the `fa-translation-index` island publishing `site.baseurl` to
 * JavaScript — is **done** as of 2026-10-02: the island is gone and the facts
 * are fetched once from `assets/harness/site.json`, the same move this file
 * made for the banner. Measured on a local build the day it landed: 2356 pages
 * carried it at 9482 B each, 22.34 MB on ONE distinct payload.
 *
 * ## The footer carries the same stamp, and it is filled the same way
 *
 * `docs/_includes/footer_custom.html` renders `short_sha`, `built_at` and
 * `run_url` from `docs/_data/build.yml` into the footer of EVERY page. A fresh
 * `date -u` there made every page unique on every run — the same defect as the
 * banner, one include away — and it SURVIVED the banner fix. Measured on two
 * deploys of one branch three minutes apart, both already shipping the
 * constant banner: **1466 insertions, 1465 deletions across 613 files, every
 * page changed by exactly one line**.
 *
 * So the staging build no longer writes those three keys; Jekyll renders the
 * footer identically every time, and {@link CLIENT}'s `stamp()` fills the real
 * values from the same `staging.json` the banner already fetches. The reader
 * loses nothing — only the moment the value is bound moves from build time to
 * load time. `docs-site.yml` still stamps the MAIN site, where there is one
 * copy and nothing to deduplicate.
 *
 * That this was missed until the deployed artefact was measured is the point
 * worth keeping: the unit test proved the FRAGMENT constant and was right,
 * and the page still was not. A test of the part is not a measurement of the
 * whole.
 *
 * ## Two rules the client script must not break
 *
 * **A failed fetch must still say PREVIEW.** The banner exists so a reviewer
 * cannot mistake staged content for the published site; if `staging.json`
 * cannot be read, the page must still announce itself. *"Could not determine"
 * is never rendered as "this is the real site"* — the same third-state rule
 * the rest of this repository runs on, and here the failure mode is a
 * reviewer approving the wrong artefact. So the static markup carries
 * "FEATURE BRANCH" and the fetch only ever ADDS detail.
 *
 * **Every value from the JSON goes in as `textContent`, never as markup.**
 * Git ref names may contain `<`, `>` and `"` — they are not in git's
 * forbidden set, which stops at space, `~`, `^`, `:`, `?`, `*`, `[`, `\` and
 * the control characters. A branch name is therefore attacker-influenced
 * markup if it is ever concatenated into HTML. The old bash banner
 * interpolated `$BRANCH` into a string; this one builds nodes.

/**
 * The banner must PUSH THE FIXED SIDEBAR DOWN, not sit on top of it.
 *
 * just-the-docs makes `.side-bar` `position: fixed; top: 0`. A `position:
 * sticky` banner is in normal flow and moves nothing that is out of it, so the
 * banner covered the top of the sidebar: the site title, and part of the
 * toolbar row holding the theme, reading preferences, language and QR
 * controls. A reader reported the language selector "still not visible" — it
 * was under the banner.
 *
 * A fixed offset would be wrong: the banner wraps to two or three lines on a
 * narrow viewport, and its height is not knowable here. So measure it and
 * publish the value as a custom property, on load and on resize — and now
 * also after the fetch fills it in, which is a THIRD moment the height
 * changes and the bash version never had.
 *
 * ## Two things this used to assume about the page, and both were wrong
 *
 * Reported by the owner 2026-10-02 with a screenshot: the banner was **not at
 * the top**. Measured in Chromium against the served bytes of
 * `branches/…/cat-harness/library/<dak-base>/<dak-ig>/`, the banner rendered
 * at `top: 8, left: 64` where it should have been `0, 56`.
 *
 * **It assumed the page resets `body`'s margin.** `position: sticky; top: 0`
 * resolves against the element's flow position INSIDE the margin box, so the
 * browser's default `body { margin: 8px }` holds the banner 8px off every
 * edge. The arithmetic is the proof: that page sets `body{padding-left:56px}`
 * for its rail, and the banner measured `left: 64` — 56 + 8. just-the-docs
 * ships `body{margin:0` in `just-the-docs-default.css`, which is the only
 * reason this was invisible for ~2,400 pages; a layout that does not use the
 * theme never had it. So `body{margin:0}` is a NO-OP on the theme pages and
 * the fix everywhere else.
 *
 * **It assumed the fixed chrome is called `.side-bar`.** That is
 * just-the-docs' name for it. The library viewer's chrome is `.fa-nav`
 * (`position: fixed; top: 0; z-index: 2147483000`), which this rule never
 * matched, so the rail was never pushed down and sat level with the banner —
 * the exact defect the section above says this rule exists to prevent, on a
 * layout written after it. Naming both is the narrow fix; the general lesson
 * is that a selector list is a list of the layouts somebody remembered.
 *
 * Measured after, same page: banner `top: 0, left: 56, right: 1280` and
 * `.fa-nav` `top: 32` — pushed down by exactly the banner's height.
 *
 * ## Fixed, full width, since 2026-10-04 — it was still sticky inside body
 *
 * Owner, with three screenshots of an IRIS replica page: *"banner is wrong
 * on page load, scrolls, and then is at top. should always be at top"* and
 * *"upper left corner should be filled with green banner too"*. Both were the
 * banner living in `body`'s flow:
 *
 * - **Not at the top on load.** The folio glass band (`docs-ui.css`, bean
 *   `g9r2`) gives a replica's `body` `padding-top: 2.25rem`. A sticky banner
 *   is laid out inside that padding, so it rendered at `top: 36` and only
 *   reached 0 once the page scrolled. Measured on the served bytes:
 *   `banner [56, 36]` at load, `[56, 0]` after a 300px scroll.
 * - **The corner.** `body{padding-left:56px}` for the rail put the banner's
 *   left edge at 56, and the rail itself is pushed DOWN by the offset, so the
 *   56×(banner height) square above the rail was bare page.
 *
 * So the banner is `position: fixed; left: 0; right: 0` and the room it needs
 * is reserved on `html`, which no page pads. It is above the rail's z-index so
 * an expanded rail cannot paint over it. The `body{padding-left}` defect class
 * — "a selector list is a list of the layouts somebody remembered" — cannot
 * recur through padding any more, because nothing that pads `body` reaches it.
