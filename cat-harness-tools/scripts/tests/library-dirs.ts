/**
 * Where the declared libraries are, for tests that assert about the REAL

 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Bean `frs5` moved the four library entries out of `cat-harness/library/`
 * into `who-iris/library/` and `folio-assistant-sci/library/`, and twenty-three
 * tests broke — every one of them because it had composed the path instead of
 * reading the declaration. They were not wrong to assert about the real
 * corpus; that is the point of those tests, and a fixture cannot make the
 * claim they make. They were wrong to believe they knew where it was.
 *
 * Composing it once here is not the same as composing it twenty-three times:
 * this reads `harness.json` and follows the next move on its own.
 *
