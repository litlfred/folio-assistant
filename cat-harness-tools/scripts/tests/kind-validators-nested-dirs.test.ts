/**
 * A node in a directory declared FROM WITHIN is its kind's node.
 *
 * Bean `8lcl`, folio-assistant#2812. `beans/beans.json` declares `workflows`
 * as a `workflow-state` directory, and `directoryEntriesForGraph` resolves it.
 * `sweepFamilies` read `beans/workflows/`, then asked which declared directory
 * held each file most closely. It knew only instance-level entries, so the
 * answer was the enclosing `beans/`, which is not a `workflow-state` directory,
 * and every node was dropped. `require-all` then reported `workflow-state` as
 * EXAMINED NOTHING over a directory holding a node.
 *
 * The guard it misfired is still needed (folio-assistant#2529): a node in a
 * DEEPER directory of another kind belongs to that kind, not to an enclosing
 * one. Both halves are pinned here.
