/**
 * The dynamic-state document is written by whoever links it.
 *
 * Measured 2026-10-30 on litlfred/smart-ra (cat-harness-tools 9326f5d
 * onward): its instance-site build (`build-instance-site.ts`) ran the state
 * visualiser, whose workflow pages link `<site>/<harness>/state.jsonld`, but
 * only `render-pipeline.ts` (stage 3, `dynamic-state-export.ts`) wrote that
 * file. The link gate found 1 unresolved link and refused the publish.
 * cat-harness-tools#937 made the generator write the document whenever it
 * draws a workflow page; these tests hold it to the one writer stage 3 uses.
