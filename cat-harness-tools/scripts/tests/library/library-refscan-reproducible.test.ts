/**
 * `library:viz`'s committed projection must not carry a measurement of the
 * MACHINE that built it — bean `65oe`.
 *
 * It did. `refScan.filesRead` counted the json files the reference scan read
 * ON DISK, so the value was a property of the checkout rather than of the
 * library, and committing it made the artefact unable to agree with itself:
 * measured across twelve commits on one branch, CI wrote 2540/2555, a cloud
 * container 2646–2663 and another container 2537/2538, alternating as each
 * side pushed. Each regenerated correctly; each saw the other as stale.
 *
 * Nothing caught it, and that is the reason for this file rather than a gate:
 * `library:viz` is one of the two inputs `regen` names as **UNGATED**, so the
 * churn was silent and a fully green head could carry a stale index.
 *
 * These tests fail if the field comes back, and — more usefully — if any NEW
 * key of the same kind is added beside it.
