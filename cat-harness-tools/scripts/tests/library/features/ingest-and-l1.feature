    Given a probe with no outline and 50000 characters
    When the plan is made
    Then the rung is pdf-structure with one pdf-structure.py step
    And the reason mentions the "trust tests"

  Scenario: The verdict sidecar's subject is the asset and its producer the tool
    Given the sidecar document of a full entry
    Then its schema is qa-results/v1 and its subject kind is library-document
    And its producer is scripts/check-l1-complete.ts with a 12-hex-digit script hash

  @test:scripts/tests/library/ingest-and-l1.test.ts::the_verdict_as_a_committed_sidecar::a_DEFECT_and_a_GAP_are_separate_families,_and_neither_is_hidden
  Scenario: Unmet and not-derivable are separate families
    Given the sidecar document of an entry with no sections
    Then the unmet family counts 1
    And the not-derivable family counts the NOT_DERIVABLE list

  @test:scripts/tests/library/ingest-and-l1.test.ts::the_verdict_as_a_committed_sidecar::total_counts_the_not-derivable_too,_so_it_is_zero_only_when_every_requirement_was_checked
  Scenario: The total counts not-derivable requirements
    Given the sidecar document of a full entry
    Then the unmet family counts 0
    And the total and the not-derivable family both equal the NOT_DERIVABLE count

  Scenario: The real corpus's verdicts are current, unknown or absent as stored
    Given the harness root declares a library with at least one entry
    When the qa results directory is declared as storage
    Then each entry whose results are stored reads unknown, and each with no library-qa directory reads absent
    And when no library-qa results are committed, every entry reads absent
    And otherwise no sidecar is stale

  Scenario: The audio-transcripts probe is an allowed entry directory and the claim is retired
    # Gap: the title says the arm writes the probe; the body checks only that transcript is an allowed entry directory, never that the recording arm writes it.
    Then the audio-transcripts probe is "transcript"
    And transcript is among the allowed entry directories
    And audio-transcripts is no longer in NOT_DERIVABLE

  Scenario: The shared narrative-bearing list holds images.json
    # Gap: the title says this gate reads images.json because of the shared list; the body checks only the list's contents, not that the gate uses it.
    Then the narrative-bearing list contains images.json

    And the ingest source runs no plan steps in promote mode

  @test:scripts/tests/library/ingest-and-l1.test.ts::refuse_to_promote_—_the_gate_between_the_arms_and_the_library::the_derived_arms_run_for_a_PDF_rung_and_NOT_for_archive_or_tabular
  Scenario: The derived arms follow a PDF rung only
    Given a pdf-pages plan of one step
    When the derived arms are added
    Then there are 10 steps: the rung, latex-math-overlay, pdf-images, pdf-vector-labels, pdf-vector-figures, l1-blocks, pdf-footnotes, extract-candidates, apply-image-verdicts and pdf-cover
    And each arm is given its stated source, staging root, entry, library or cover path

  Scenario: The ingest source points the arms at staging
    Given the ingest-document.ts source
    Then it plans against the staging root and never plans with the default library
    And it no longer prints "run the remaining arms"
    And it gives pdf-images the staging root and l1-blocks the staging entry directory

  @test:scripts/tests/library/ingest-and-l1.test.ts::refuse_to_promote_—_the_gate_between_the_arms_and_the_library::the_verdict_arm_runs_AFTER_pdf-images.py,_which_is_the_whole_mechanism
  Scenario: The verdict arm runs after pdf-images

  Scenario: The verdict arm is given the destination library
    Given a pdf-pages plan with the derived arms added for library /some/library
    Then the apply-image-verdicts step's --library is /some/library
    And it is not given the staging root

  @test:scripts/tests/library/ingest-and-l1.test.ts::refuse_to_promote_—_the_gate_between_the_arms_and_the_library::staging_is_NOT_dot-prefixed
  Scenario: The staging directory is not dot-prefixed

  Scenario: The printed promote command is the caller's command plus --promote
    Then the promote command for a file and --library keeps both and adds --promote
    And a file name with a space is quoted
    And --dry-run is dropped and --promote is not doubled

  Scenario: A text layer that is mojibake, or that reverses Arabic ligatures, sends the document to OCR
    Given a probe whose text layer is mostly letters
    Then it is readable
    And a probe whose non-space characters are under 55% letters is mojibake
    And a probe where 967 of 12798 Arabic words carry a reversed lam-alef or lam-yeh ligature scrambles right-to-left ligatures
    And 10 of 12798 is readable
    And 20 Arabic words are too few to judge, and a probe with no counts decides nothing

  Scenario: --qa-later promotes past unmet image descriptions and nothing else
    Given an entry whose only unmet requirement is image-descriptions
    Then it does not promote by default
    And it promotes with --qa-later
    And an entry with image-descriptions and structure unmet does not promote even with --qa-later

  Scenario: An empty requirement list may promote, but an empty entry never yields one
    # Gap: the title says an empty list does NOT promote; the body asserts that mayPromote([]) is true, and relies on checkEntry never returning an empty list.
    Then an empty requirement list may promote
    And the L1 check of an empty directory yields at least one requirement
