/**
 * The cache scripts' BUILT-IN family names agree with each other.
 *
 * `special-branches.json` used to be the one place these names lived, with a
 * test that every copy agreed with it. The owner removed it on 2026-10-05
 * (*"dont use /get rid of"*): a family's name is now the declaring folio's
 * `storage.branchPrefix`, read first by every script, and each script keeps
 * the same built-in names only as a fallback when nothing is declared. So the
 * drift worth catching is between the scripts themselves — one script whose
 * fallback list lost a name, or reordered it, resolves a different branch from
 * the rest when no declaration is present.
 *
 * A cache family whose scripts live in a layer above is tested by that layer:
 * the Lean cache scripts and the folio template's restore action moved up
 * (folio-assistant#2598, move M11), and a test here naming their paths would be
 * this layer naming one above it.
 *
 * Each script names the names as whole tokens: `lake-cache` is a substring of
 * both newer names, so a bare `toContain` would pass a file that never names it.
