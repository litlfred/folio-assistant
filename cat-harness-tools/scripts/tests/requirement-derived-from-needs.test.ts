/**
 * A requirement's `derivedFrom` resolves against this instance AND everything
 * it `needs` — the rule `resolution-across-needs.test.ts` pins for skills and
 * roles, one node kind over (bean `w1gy`, owner option A, 2026-10-30).
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `requirement-derived-from-resolves` checked each `derivedFrom` against the
 * audited instance's OWN requirements only. fhir-harness#233 moved
 * `skills/requirements/fhir-validation.json` into fhir-harness, and it derives
 * from `req:content-lifecycle`, which cat-harness — four layers down its
 * `needs` — declares. Measured on `kg:audit --instance ./fhir-harness` before
 * the fix: `requirement-derived-from-resolves` **fail (1)** on
 * `req:fhir-validation`; after it, **pass**.
 *
 * ## Both directions, on a constructed pair
 *
 * A synthetic `top` that `needs` a synthetic `base`, so the verdict cannot
 * drift with the corpus: a parent `base` declares resolves, and a parent that
 * no layer declares is still a failure. The second case is what keeps the
 * widening from becoming "anything goes".
 *
