/**
 * `workflow_complete` screens its arguments as a hand-over before anything
 * else runs (bean `cztn`, rules H3 and H9 of `zero-trust-handover`).
 *
 * Every call here names an instance that does not exist, on purpose: the
 * screen runs FIRST, so an injected control field is refused by the screen,
 * while a clean call or a quarantined note gets as far as the instance lookup
 * and fails there. Which error comes back says how far the call got.
