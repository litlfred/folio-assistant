/**
 * `skill-register` — the command that makes adding a skill a one-command change,
 * and the gate that refuses one that arrived without it.
 *
 * Beans `v625` (the chain) and `nfv3` (the declaration audit and the gate). Two
 * commands one letter apart were consolidated on 2026-09-26 at the owner's
 * decision, and so were their two suites.
 *
 * ## Two assertion shapes, and both are load-bearing
 *
 * **The chain half does NOT re-measure which artefacts a skill stales.** That
 * needs a throwaway skill and per-check isolated runs — a session's work rather
 * than a unit test. These guard the ways the declaration could rot between such
 * measurements, in both directions: a step silently dropped, and a step added
 * back from memory.
 *
 * **The audit half is falsified on synthetic packages.** The real-corpus test is
 * `✓ every skill declared`, and on its own that is worth nothing: it passes
 * identically whether the checker works or returns empty lists. So every finder
 * is falsified against a package where the defect is present BY CONSTRUCTION,
 * and the real corpus carries an anti-vacuity floor — a rename of the declared
 * skills directory must not turn the suite green over nothing, which is the
 * zero-subject trap this repository has paid for more than once (bean `dh4f`).
 *
 * Two of those cases exist because they were found by breaking the tool rather
 * than by designing it: deleting a registered probe left an orphaned `kg-qa`
 * sidecar that no regeneration can settle, and left a manifest entry pointing at
 * nothing — `manifest-skill-exists` at severity **critical**.
