/**
 * The tools graph has a surface of its own, and it stays separate from skills.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-21: **"keep tools and skills separate!"**
 *
 * They were not. `cat-harness.json`'s `tools` entry declared its documentation
 * as `cat-harness/docs/concepts/skills.md` — a page titled *"Skills & roles"* with no
 * tools section in it. The tools graph had no documentation of its own and
 * named a page about something else.
 *
 * ## The assertion shape that matters here
 *
 * The defect was invisible to every check because the declared path **existed**.
 * An absent `docs` ref is a legible gap; a ref that resolves REPORTS COVERAGE.
 * So a test asserting only "the docs ref resolves to a file" would have passed
 * on the broken declaration, which is exactly how it survived.
 *
 * What is asserted instead is that the two graphs' documentation are DIFFERENT
 * pages, and that the tools one is about tools. The second half cannot be fully
 * mechanised — "is this page about this subject" is not decidable — so it is
 * approximated honestly: the page must mention the graph's own vocabulary, and
 * the assertion says so rather than pretending to more.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/tests/tools-viewer.test
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (joins every Tool to the
 * skills of every instance in the checkout) live in
 * `test/tools-viewer-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it.
