/**
 * Every step title in the site's drawing is a link, on every site.
 *
 * A downstream site publishes no subject pages (#1581), so `subjectHref`
 * answers `undefined` there. Before this the step's title was then left
 * unlinked, and a guide's business-processes page showing the site's drawing
 * had no step affordance a process page on the host has. The title now falls
 * back to the process's page in the processes viewer, which every site that
 * publishes the drawing publishes.
 *
 * `render-bpmn.ts` runs on import, so this reads its source, as
 * `render-bpmn-single-writer.test.ts` does.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/process/render-bpmn-title-fallback.test
