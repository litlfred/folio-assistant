/**
 * The interpreter reports what an agent is acting AS, not only which box the
 * step was drawn in.
 *
 * `enabled()` took `(model, state)` and returned the lane's free-text name.
 * That is not an answer to "who performs this" — sixty lane strings spell two
 * dozen positions — so an agent handed a step could not find out what skills
 * its performer carries. These pin the join, and the fallback that keeps an
 * unmigrated instance working.
