# The journeys viewer (scripts/journeys/read.ts, render.ts, present.ts and
# scripts/gen-journeys-viz.ts) over a fixture checkout of two layers: every journey,
# each journey alone, sub-graphs, the workshop layer and its presentation pages.
# Each Scenario names the test that executes it.

  Scenario: presentation.tagRows groups a step's tags into the policy card's rows, with glyphs, in its order
    Given a workshop whose tagRows are "Cost driver" over an unlisted table and "Forces" over the rights table
    When the P2 walkthrough is rendered
    Then its forces list has a "Forces" row with a glyph and the pill "Trust anchor ★"
    And it does not show the table title "Decision rights" or the empty "Cost driver" row
    And the schema refuses the workshop whose row names an unlisted table, and accepts it with only the Forces row

  Scenario: The sheets open with a cover page holding the blanks, the scope promise and the ways to start
    Given the default sheets page
    Then it opens with an A3 cover before sheet s1, with blanks Country, Delegation, Table and Facilitator, and no ways to start
    When a workshop with a promise and a cover of fields Country and Table over the rights table is rendered
    Then its sheets page shows the scope promise and the rights rows as ways to start, beginning "Trust anchor"
    And it has no Delegation blank and says "A cover and 1 sheet,"
    And journeys.css breaks every printed sheet to its own page
    And the schema accepts that workshop and refuses a cover naming an unlisted table

  Scenario: mentioned finds the people a sentence names, in cast order, without the card's own person
    Given people Somsack, Khamla and Vilay
    Then a sentence naming Vilay, Somsack and Vilay again mentions s then v
    And "Khamla brings Somsack" for Khamla's own card mentions only s
    And a sentence naming nobody gives no chips
    And "Tells Vilay" gives a mentions chip with Vilay's small avatar

  Scenario: Links out: kramdown anchors, page patterns, the site's root and JSON colouring
    When the link helpers are applied
    Then kramdownSlug turns step titles into GitHub-style anchors such as "j1--born-abroad-thailand-birth-day"
    And fillPattern fills "{type}-{id}" placeholders
    And fromSite prefixes a relative href but keeps absolute and root-relative ones
    And siteRootFrom climbs out of the route "en/h/journeys" to "../../../../../"
    And highlightJson wraps punctuation, keys, strings, numbers, booleans and null in spans, escaping markup and keeping escaped quotes inside a string

    Given the policy workshop's presentation
    Then ana's feeling points are emotion 1 at 0 and -1 at 1, and cleo has none
    And the wallet is used at P2 to "shows the QR"
    And step refs resolve "p2-treated#P2" and "P1", but not a journey the workshop does not teach
    And the demo is "frame", P2's screens are S2, and S2's href is "../app/#/demo/S2"

  @test:scripts/tests/journeys-viz.test.ts::presentation_helpers::small_ones
  Scenario: Small presentation helpers
    Then countWord spells 4 as "Four" and leaves 40 as digits
    And rangeLabel joins first and last step ids with the scope, or gives one id alone
    And countryTones assigns amber, sky and indigo to distinct countries in order
    And rungOf gives a step's record state's index on the ladder, or -1 without one

  Scenario: bpmnFigure leaves a drawing alone with no task named, and adds no panel without a sidecar
    When a figure is built with no tasks and no sidecar
    Then the drawing's group is unchanged with no highlight and no data-panel
    And with tasks A, B, A and a sidecar the figure carries the panel and the highlight "A B"

    Then no ArchiMate view is drawn as an img
    And an object labelled "P2 on the RA" has data landing on archimate/ra/views/v-p2.svg
    And a DAK link lands on the view's page "en/lower/archimate/ra/views/v-p2/"

  Scenario: A persona's name links to the ActorDefinition of the role it plays; one with none stays text
    Then pascal turns "birth-clinic-vaccinator" into "BirthClinicVaccinator"
    And ana's persona artifact is "ActorDefinition/Demo.Role.Pilgrim" while ben has none
    And the walkthrough, journey page and overview each link the ActorDefinition page
    And Ben appears as plain bold text

  Scenario: A FHIR example links to its IG page in the hood and the payload drawer; an unlisted profile stays text
    Given the P2 walkthrough
    Then a DAK link lands on "Bundle-ana-ips.html"
    And the drawer's pane links the same page
    And the profile "ips-bundle" is plain text reading "Intl profile"

  Scenario: The walkthrough's hood draws Data, Decision logic and Indicators in order, each linked; an unlisted one stays text
    Given the P2 walkthrough's DAK row
    Then its groups are data, decides, measures, labelled Data, Decision logic, Indicators
    And its links land on the data set, decision table and indicator pages in that order
    And the data set link is titled with its key and description
    And Measure/IND99, which the index does not list, is plain text "IND99"

  Scenario: A missing page, a missing element link inside a drawing, and the bare IHE VHL root are findings
    Given the staged site with the ActorDefinition page and the wallet element page removed, and a page linking the bare VHL root and a VHL page
    When the DAK links are checked
    Then findings name the missing ActorDefinition page and, from the view SVG, the missing element page
    And exactly one finding names the bare IHE VHL root
    And a link to an anchor missing from its page is a finding 'no id "nowhere" in Bundle-ana-ips.html'
