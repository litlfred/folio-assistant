# The quiet-claim liveness sweep: a branch is a signal only for the beans it
# changes, a bulk ref is excluded and reported, and a sweep that could not
# determine is never a clean run. Fixture repositories are a throwaway origin
# with side branches, cloned. Each Scenario names the test that executes it.
Feature: Quiet-claim liveness

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::a_reference_to_a_bean_is_bean-SHAPED,_never_a_bare_id_(thux's_trap)::the_qualified_form_is_a_reference
  Scenario: The qualified bean id is a reference
    Then "fixes folio-assistant-2634 at last" references bean "2634"

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::a_reference_to_a_bean_is_bean-SHAPED,_never_a_bare_id_(thux's_trap)::the_backticked_bare_id_is_a_reference_—_how_beans_are_cited_in_prose_here
  Scenario: The backticked bare id is a reference
    Then "bean `2634` is the cause" references bean "folio-assistant-2634"

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::a_reference_to_a_bean_is_bean-SHAPED,_never_a_bare_id_(thux's_trap)::a_bare_id_inside_a_version_string_is_NOT_—_the_measured_false_positive
  Scenario: A bare id inside a version string is not a reference
    Then "bump foo from 1.2634.0 to 1.2635.0" does not reference bean "2634"

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::a_reference_to_a_bean_is_bean-SHAPED,_never_a_bare_id_(thux's_trap)::a_bare_id_as_a_plain_word_is_not_a_reference_either
  Scenario: A bare id as a plain word is not a reference
    Then "see 2634 for details" does not reference bean "2634"

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::a_reference_to_a_bean_is_bean-SHAPED,_never_a_bare_id_(thux's_trap)::an_id_that_is_a_regex_metacharacter_run_does_not_throw_or_match_everything
  Scenario: An id made of regex metacharacters neither throws nor matches everything
    Then "anything at all" does not reference bean "a.*b"

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::the_branch_signal_names_the_bean_it_is_about::a_branch_changing_one_bean_file_is_a_signal_for_THAT_bean_only
  Scenario: A branch changing one bean file is a signal for that bean only
    Given branches feature-x changing bean bbbb and feature-y changing bean cccc
    When the refs changing beans against origin/main are listed
    Then feature-x changes only bbbb's file and feature-y only cccc's

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::the_branch_signal_names_the_bean_it_is_about::a_branch_that_merged_main_in_does_NOT_inherit_main's_bean_churn
  Scenario: A branch that merged main in does not inherit main's bean churn
    Given branch feature-x changing bean bbbb, and main then changing three other beans and being merged into feature-x
    When the refs changing beans against origin/main are listed
    Then feature-x changes only bbbb's file

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::the_branch_signal_names_the_bean_it_is_about::a_merged_branch_is_not_live_work_at_all
  Scenario: A branch merged into main is not live work
    Given branch feature-x merged into main
    When the refs changing beans against origin/main are listed
    Then origin/feature-x is not among them

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::the_branch_signal_names_the_bean_it_is_about::carries_the_ref's_tip_age,_so_an_abandoned_branch_is_visible_rather_than_counted_blind
  Scenario: A changing ref carries its tip's age
    Given branch feature-x changing one bean
    When the refs changing beans are listed
    Then the first carries a tip age of zero hours or more

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::a_bulk_ref_is_excluded_from_the_signal_and_REPORTED::a_ref_changing_more_than_11_bean_files_is_bulk
  Scenario: A ref changing more than the bulk threshold of bean files
    # Gap: only that the ref's file list exceeds the threshold is asserted; that the sweep classes it bulk and excludes it is not
    Given a branch "sweep" changing one more bean file than the bulk threshold
    When the refs changing beans are listed
    Then sweep's file list is longer than the threshold

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::a_bulk_ref_is_excluded_from_the_signal_and_REPORTED::the_threshold_sits_AT_the_measured_gap,_not_at_a_round_number
  Scenario: The bulk threshold sits at the measured gap
    Then the bulk threshold is 11 bean files

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::a_bulk_ref_is_excluded_from_the_signal_and_REPORTED::the_excluded_refs_reach_the_report_—_an_exclusion_nobody_sees_is_a_silence_list
  Scenario: Excluded bulk refs reach the report
    Given a checked sweep whose bulk refs include "origin/claude/BULK-REF-NAME" changing 198 files
    When the report is formatted
    Then it names "BULK-REF-NAME" and "198"

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::could_not_determine_is_never_a_clean_run::an_undetermined_sweep_reports_no_quiet_claims_at_all
  Scenario: An undetermined sweep reports no quiet claims
    Given an undetermined sweep with the reason "THE-STATED-REASON"
    When the report is formatted
    Then it says "COULD NOT DETERMINE", gives the reason and says "not a clean run"
    And it has no "QUIET — no open PR" line

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::could_not_determine_is_never_a_clean_run::ref_freshness_is_part_of_the_evidence,_and_the_limit_is_short_on_purpose
  Scenario: The ref freshness limit is short
    # Gap: only the constant is checked; that a stale ref makes the sweep undetermined is not exercised
    Then the ref freshness limit is at most 30 minutes

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::could_not_determine_is_never_a_clean_run::a_repo_with_no_GitHub_origin_is_undetermined,_not_quiet
  Scenario: A repository with no GitHub origin has no origin slug
    # Gap: only that no slug is derived is asserted; that the sweep is then undetermined rather than quiet is not
    Given a clone whose origin is a local path
    Then no origin slug is derived

  @test:scripts/tests/quiet-claim-liveness.test.ts::this_repository::can_establish_how_stale_its_own_refs_are
  Scenario: The freshness probe runs against this repository
    # Gap: can never fail in practice: an undefined age, i.e. staleness NOT established, passes, so the title's claim is never asserted
    When the age of this repository's fetched refs is read
    Then it is undefined or zero minutes or more
