  Scenario: A builder call inside a template literal is not a manifest
    Given a source file passing manifest text in a template literal to a function
    When its block manifest is read

  Scenario: A real manifest reads with kind and label
    Given a file whose default export is proposition with label "prop:real-one"

  Scenario: A decoy label in a comment does not win over the real field
    Given a remark manifest whose comment names "rem:ghost" and whose label is "rem:actual"
    When its block manifest is read
    Then its label is "rem:actual"

  @test:scripts/tests/read-block-manifest-masking.test.ts::readBlockManifest_ignores_builders_and_labels_inside_strings::a_manifest_with_no_label_is_not_a_block
  Scenario: A manifest with no label is not a block
    Given a remark manifest with only a title
    When its block manifest is read
    Then there is none

  @test:scripts/tests/read-block-manifest-masking.test.ts::readBlockManifest_ignores_builders_and_labels_inside_strings::a_missing_file_is_undefined,_not_a_throw
  Scenario: A missing file has no manifest
    When the block manifest of a file that does not exist is read

  @test:scripts/tests/read-block-manifest-masking.test.ts::readBlockManifest_ignores_builders_and_labels_inside_strings::cleanup
  Scenario: The temporary directory is removed
    # Gap: CAN NEVER FAIL. This is a cleanup step whose only assertion is that true is true.
    When the fixture directory is removed
    Then nothing is checked
