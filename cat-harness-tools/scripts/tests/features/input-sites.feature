    Given the library runs git log on "f017-ref" annotated "refs f017-ref" and is committed
    When the fingerprint is taken before the ref exists
    Then it is a hash
    And after branch "f017-ref" is created, the hash differs

  @test:scripts/tests/input-sites.test.ts::the_fingerprint_refuses_what_it_cannot_see::the_fingerprint_HASHES_what_a_verdict_names::an_IGNORED_file_under_{tracked}_—_a_walker_reads_it_whether_or_not_git_does

  Scenario: A qa-reports read is tolerated only for a ref whose baseline was hashed
    Given a child that reaches the qa-reports line for ref "main"
    Then the trace reports nothing when "main" was hashed
    And it reports the "main" line when no ref was hashed

    Then it reports nothing

  @test:scripts/tests/input-sites.test.ts::the_runtime_trace::without_the_variable_set,_the_hook_writes_nothing_anywhere
  Scenario: Without the trace variable set, the hook can be called freely
    # Gap: that nothing is written anywhere is not checked; the test only calls the hook and quietly() without the variable and asserts nothing
    Given the trace variable is unset
    When inputSiteReached is called directly and inside quietly()
    Then the calls complete

  @test:scripts/tests/input-sites.test.ts::annotations_hold_to_the_data_that_chooses_their_targets::every_instance_a_loader_can_reach_is_one_level_below_the_checkout,_where_the_`*/`_globs_look

  Scenario: outsideTemplates blanks template text only, and only on a balanced lex
    Given source with an import, a comment and a template literal holding an import and an expression
    When template text is blanked
    Then the import from "./a.ts" and the expression "f(\"./k\")" remain

  Scenario: A traced fingerprint does not hash a computed target, while an untraced one does
    Given a check whose computed load is annotated "imports v.ts"
    When "v.ts" changes
    Then the fingerprint with the tree replayed keeps its hash
    And the fingerprint without it changes its hash

  Scenario: Every Tool's in-process registrar is listed by the tool-registrars declaration
    Given every Tool in every instance root with an MCP invocation and an in-process module
    When the module is resolved as tool-api's MCP tool list resolves it
    Then the "tool-registrars" declaration lists modules
    And each resolved module is one it names
    And scripts/tool-api.ts carries a "declared" annotation with source "tool-registrars"
