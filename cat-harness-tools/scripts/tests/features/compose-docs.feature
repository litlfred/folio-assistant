Feature: Composing the docs layers into one site

  @test:scripts/tests/compose-docs.test.ts::compose-docs_reads_its_layers_from_the_declaration::base_first,_overlay_last_—_and_the_non-docs_entry_is_not_a_layer
  Scenario: The docs layers are the docs entries in order, base before overlay
    Given a fixture declaring "docs", a repository-scoped "root-docs" and a non-docs "schemas" entry
    When its docs layers are read
    Then the layers are "docs" then "root-docs"
    And only "root-docs" is repository-scoped
    And no layer is missing

  @test:scripts/tests/compose-docs.test.ts::compose-docs_reads_its_layers_from_the_declaration::a_declared_layer_with_NO_directory_is_reported,_never_silently_empty
  Scenario: A declared docs layer with no directory is reported missing
    Given a fixture whose "root-docs" directory has been removed
    When its docs layers are read
    Then the layers are "docs" alone
    And the missing layers are "root-docs"

  @test:scripts/tests/compose-docs.test.ts::compose-docs_reads_its_layers_from_the_declaration::a_declared_layer_absent_because_it_is_BUILT_AT_PUBLISH_is_pending,_not_missing
  Scenario: A layer declared built at publish and not yet built is pending
    Given a fixture whose root declares "built/" as a docs layer built at publish, with no such directory
    When its docs layers are read
    Then "built-docs" is pending, nothing is missing, and it is not among the layers
    And once "built/" exists it is among the layers

  @test:scripts/tests/compose-docs.test.ts::an_EMPTY_overlay_composes_byte-identically_—_the_safety_property::on_the_real_tree,_every_file_and_every_byte_matches_the_base
  Scenario: Composing the real tree keeps every non-withheld base file byte-identical
    Given the real repository, whose instance layers are "site-chrome" then "docs"
    When it is composed
    Then more than 100 files are supplied
    And every override is a site-chrome file under "_includes/generated/"
    And the composed "_config.yml" parses to the merge of the two layers' configs
    And every other base file that is not withheld has the same digest
    And the only base files missing from the output are the withheld ones
    And every added file sits under a composed layer's prefix or is a reported alias, forward or held page
    And there are no alias collisions, and no forwarding page replaces a layer's file
    And files are added exactly when some layer composed

    Then only "a.md" is supplied
    And no ".gitkeep" is written

  @test:scripts/tests/compose-docs.test.ts::an_override_is_applied_AND_reported::the_overlay's_bytes_win
  Scenario: An overlay file replaces the base file's bytes
    Given a base with "p.md" as "BASE" and "keep.md" as "untouched"
    And an overlay with "p.md" as "OVERLAY"
    When it is composed
    Then "p.md" reads "OVERLAY"
    And "keep.md" reads "untouched"

  @test:scripts/tests/compose-docs.test.ts::an_override_is_applied_AND_reported::...and_BOTH_layers_are_named,_which_is_the_ruling's_actual_requirement
  Scenario: An override names the path, the base layer and the overriding layer
    Given a base and an overlay that both hold "p.md"
    When it is composed
    Then the overrides are exactly "p.md" from base layer "docs" by "root-docs"

  @test:scripts/tests/compose-docs.test.ts::an_override_is_applied_AND_reported::a_path_only_the_overlay_has_is_ADDED,_not_an_override
  Scenario: A file only the overlay has is reported as added, not as an override
    Given a base with "p.md" and an overlay with "new.md"
    When it is composed
    Then there are no overrides
    And the added files are "new.md"
    And "new.md" is supplied by "root-docs" and "p.md" by "docs"

  @test:scripts/tests/compose-docs.test.ts::an_override_is_applied_AND_reported::nested_paths_override_at_the_right_path,_not_by_basename
  Scenario: A nested overlay file overrides only the same nested path
    Given a base with "guides/a.md" and "b.md"
    And an overlay with "guides/a.md"

  Scenario: A Jekyll config is merged with the overlay's keys winning
    Given a base config with title "BASE" and plugins "jekyll-feed"
    And an overlay config with title "OVERLAY"
    When it is composed
    Then the composed config's title is "OVERLAY" and its plugins are "jekyll-feed"
    And the config is reported neither as an override nor as added

  @test:scripts/tests/compose-docs.test.ts::a_Jekyll_config_is_MERGED,_overlay_keys_winning::...and_the_CHANGED_KEYS_are_named,_not_counted
  Scenario: A merged config reports the keys the overlay changed
    Given a base config with title and color
    And an overlay config with only title
    When it is composed

  Scenario: A config only the base holds is copied byte for byte
    Given a base config with a comment, a title and plugins, and no overlay config
    When it is composed
    Then the composed config has exactly the base's bytes
    And nothing is reported as merged

  Scenario: A key only the base has is kept unchanged
    Given a base with a 1 and b 2
    When an overlay with a 9 is merged over it
    Then the result is a 9 and b 2
    And only "a" is reported as changed

    Given the real tree composed in full and composed for a branch changing only "cat-harness/docs/index.md"
    When no layer composes
    Then both trees supply the same number of files
    When layers compose
    Then some instance is not carried
