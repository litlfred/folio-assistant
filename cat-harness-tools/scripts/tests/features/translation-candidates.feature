# scripts/translation-candidates.ts collects candidate translations from open, self-hosted engines
# (OPUS-MT, a self-hosted LibreTranslate) through the one writer, addCandidates: candidates are
# appended to <catalogue>.candidates.json, a candidate whose placeholders do not round-trip is not
# recorded, and an EMPTY msgstr gets the first good candidate, fuzzy. Each Scenario names the test
# that executes it.
