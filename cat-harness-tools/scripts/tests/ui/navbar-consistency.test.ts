/**
 * `check:navbar-consistency` — the owner's navbar QA check, and the two
 * namespaces it must not conflate.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-30: *"i want QA check that each harness LHS navbar header and
 * menus are themed appropriately and has consitent layout/icon/navgation"*.
 *
 * ## What these tests hold, and why each one cost something
 *
 * **The two namespaces are separate.** An instance's `icon` is an id into its
 * own `images` list; a `directories[].tile.icon` is a name in the client's
 * glyph registry. The first draft of the checking script treated `icon: "mark"`
 * as a registry name and would have reported `cat-harness`'s navbar mark as
 * falling back to the generic net — it resolves perfectly, to
 * `/assets/img/icons/cat-mark.svg`. A test per family, so a future merge cannot
 * re-collapse them.
 *
 * **Refusal is not a pass.** Rename either registry literal and the script must
 * exit **2**, not report the glyph families clean. Bean `dh4f`:
 * could-not-determine is never rendered as green, and a registry read as empty
 * would satisfy every family below.
 *
 * **The enumerator is `instanceRootsIn`, not a glob.** A per-directory `<dir>/<dir>.json` glob gets
 * this wrong in BOTH directions — it misses the repository root, which
 * declares, and it counts `beans/beans.json`, `interaction/` and `todos/`,
 * which are graph declarations under a different schema. That is a 19 where the
 * answer is 17, and a denominator that is wrong by two is a denominator a
 * reader cannot use.
