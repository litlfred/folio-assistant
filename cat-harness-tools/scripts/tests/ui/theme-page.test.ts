/**
 * The themes page — what a reader browsing `themes/` actually gets.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-24: *"have the themes harness make themes/ page to browse"*.
 * `theme:page:check` proves the committed page is CURRENT; this file proves it
 * is USABLE, which is the distinction `check:artefact-verification` exists to
 * keep (PR #805: a page can be byte-current and still broken).
 *
 * ## What is asserted
 *
 * - **Every theme in the registry has a row, and nothing else does.** A row
 *   per theme is the page's whole claim; a theme missing from it is a theme
 *   nobody can look at.
 * - **Every image link resolves to a file the site publishes.** Over the real
 *   declaration, not a fixture — a link to art that is not under the site
 *   directory 404s for every reader.
 * - **The raw HTML survives kramdown.** No blank line and no four-space indent
 *   inside the block, because either ends the HTML block and prints the rest
 *   of the table as text. Measured on this site before: `check-escaped-markup`
 *   exists because a generator's output looked right and rendered escaped.
 * - **"Worn by" agrees with the landing board**, which is read from the same
 *   declared contributions the board is built from.
 *
 * **Not the prose**, for the reason `methodologies-viz.test.ts` gives: a test
 * pinning sentences fails every time one is improved.
 *
