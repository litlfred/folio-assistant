/**
 * A gate must be able to PASS on every event its workflow declares.
 *
 * Issue #823, bean `sddf`. `code-quality-gates.yml` declares four triggers —
 * `pull_request`, `merge_group`, `push` and `workflow_dispatch` — and one of
 * its steps read `CATALOGUE_BASE_SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}`.
 * Outside a pull-request event that is the empty string, and the fallback then
 * ran a three-dot range against an `origin/main` the same fetch had just
 * created as a shallow graft. A shallow graft has no merge base, so the script
 * exited 2 — "could not determine" — on every dispatched run.
 *
 * ## Why that is a trap rather than a nuisance
 *
 * `check-head-has-run.ts` tells an operator to dispatch this workflow when a
 * head has no run. So following the repository's own advice attached a red
 * HARD gate to a pull request that had not earned it, and the red is
 * indistinguishable at a glance from one the branch caused.
 *
 * Measured on #1633, 2026-10-01: run 36789391040, `workflow_dispatch`,
 * `Repository gates (hard)` the ONLY red among twelve checks. The branch was
 * green; the advice was not.
 *
 * ## The general rule, which is what this file tests
 *
 * The specific fix is one `--base`. The rule it belongs to is: **a step whose
 * input comes from one event's payload must say what it does on the others**,
 * because a workflow that declares a trigger is promising that trigger can
 * succeed. So the second test does not look for `--base` at all — it finds
 * every env var fed from `github.event.pull_request.*` and asserts the step
 * branches on it being empty.
 *
 * **And that second test is the weaker one — measured, not assumed.** Run
 * against the pre-fix workflow it PASSES, because the broken version did
 * branch on `-n "$CATALOGUE_BASE_SHA"`; it branched to a fallback that could
 * not succeed. Only the two specific tests above fail there (2 of 4). So the
 * general test catches "no branch at all", never "a branch that cannot work" —
 * which is the defect that actually shipped. It is kept because the absent
 * branch is a real and cheaper-to-catch failure, not because it would have
 * caught this one. Proving a fallback CAN pass needs the event, which is CI's
 * job, not a unit test's.
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/` (bean `ho66`), as
 * `merge-guard-workflows.test.ts` was: every test in it reads the aggregate
 * repository's own root — `.github/workflows/code-quality-gates.yml` — which a
 * standalone cat-harness layer does not have, and
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` collects every test in that layer.
