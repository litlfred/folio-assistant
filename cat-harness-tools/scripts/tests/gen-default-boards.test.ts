 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-21: *"Any harness above bootsteap has a board filled with all
 * contents."* Two halves, and the tests that matter are the ones that would
 * pass for a generator writing a board for everything, or for nothing.
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (reads every
 * instantiated harness in the checkout, or the root `todos/` graph) live in
 * `test/gen-default-boards-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it.
