/**
 * The published todo index, asserted over the EMITTED FILE.

 * @module scripts/tests/todo-index.test

 * **Over the artefact, not over the function that built it**, and that is the
 * point rather than a preference. This document had drifted from its own
 * `$schema` three times in one session — `viewHref`/`editHref`, then
 * `theme`/`themeArt`, then `repoWeb` — and a test against the builder would
 * have passed on every one of them, because the builder was the thing that
 * changed. The contract is what a consumer downloads.
