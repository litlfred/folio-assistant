/**
 * A folder corresponds to a subgraph, and subgraphs should be disconnected.
 *
 * Bean `x4v4`, settled by the owner 2026-09-20. The properties worth pinning
 * are the ones that were WRONG at some point while this was written, because
 * each was wrong in a way that looked like a clean result:
 *
 *  - `owningDirectory` keyed on `absPath` unconditionally, so every relative
 *    query returned `undefined`. `undefined` is a legitimate answer here (a
 *    node in no declared directory), so the bug read as a finding, and a
 *    sweep built on it would have reported an empty, healthy corpus.
 *  - `scanSubgraphs` skipped links whose target does not exist, on the
 *    reasoning that a dangling link belongs to `blv9`. That hid 13 broken
 *    links left by relocating CRDM (bean `g43o`) — a half-finished move
 *    reading as a clean disconnection.
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (attributes the
 * directories smart-base and the root layer declare) live in
 * `test/subgraphs-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing alone, cat-harness
 * has none of it.
