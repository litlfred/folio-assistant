/**
 * Several instances of one index each declaring a state graph with the SAME id.
 *
 * Found on folio-assistant#2529 (2026-10-11): cat-harness, cat-harness-tools,
 * folio-assistant-core and who-iris each declare `health` on a branch of their
 * own. `tipLocations` kept the first location per id and the markers were
 * filed by id, so only cat-harness's mounted; the other three were skipped
 * without a word, and `audit:coverage` reported `health` undetermined and
 * refused to write its sidecar.
 *
 * And the second half: a graph declared INSIDE a remote-mounted instance is
 * that instance's state, so it is read from — and pushed to — the instance's
 * own repository (named by the index lock), at its instance-relative path.
 *
 * Real repositories throughout, as in `state-mount-per-branch.test.ts`: the
 * failure is a fetch that does not happen, which a stub cannot show.
 *
