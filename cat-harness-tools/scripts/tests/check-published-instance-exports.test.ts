/**
 * The gate that runs every workflow's foreign-instance exports.
 *
 * Its subject is not the export — that is `kg-export.test.ts` — but the
 * DERIVATION: which commands it decides to run, across which files, and what
 * it does when it decides on none.
 *
 * The literals below are workflow source text on purpose. This file feeds
 * fixture text to the matcher, so rewriting those strings to reference a
 * constant would leave every detection test passing while asserting nothing
 * — the failure `check-declaration-filename.test.ts` already paid for once
 * (bean `jijc`). They stay literal.
