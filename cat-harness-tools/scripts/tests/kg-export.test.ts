/**
 * The KG export is a whole graph, not a partial one wearing a total's clothes.
 *
 * The first version of `scripts/kg-export.ts` collected skills from six
 * instruction-body directories and reported **11 BPMN skill refs as dangling**.
 * They were not dangling. They resolve through `schemas/skills/<name>/`, which
 * holds a skill's I/O contract and which that collector did not know existed —
 * so the export was a partial graph published as a complete one, in the module
 * whose own doc comment warns against exactly that.
 *
 * It is worth being precise about why that is dangerous rather than merely
 * wrong. A consumer of `kg.json` cannot tell a skill that is absent from one
 * that was never collected: both are simply not in `@graph`. The counts look
 * plausible either way. Nothing errors. That is the `dh4f` shape — a clean run
 * over a corpus the tool could not read — and the only defence is an invariant
 * asserted against something outside the exporter's own view.
 *
 * So: every skill a diagram names must appear in the export. `check-workflow-refs`
 * already guarantees those refs resolve against the real skill locations, which
 * makes the set of BPMN refs an independent witness — if the exporter's notion
 * of "where skills live" narrows again, this fails.
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (exports the graph of
 * every layer in the checkout, who-iris's packages among them) live in
 * `test/kg-export-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing alone, cat-harness
 * has none of it.

 * and measured 2026-09-27 six of those tests cost **2.0–2.6 s each** quietly —
 * 42–53 % of bun's 5000 ms default budget with the machine idle. Two of them timed
 * out in a loaded full-suite run (5009 ms and 6215 ms); which two was luck, since
 * all six sit at roughly half the budget. `EXPORT` above was already hoisted for
 * this reason, so this only finishes the job.
 *
 * Module scope belongs to NO test's timeout, which is why this is the remedy and a
 * raised timeout is not (`sff8` `## What a fix is NOT`: a bigger number decays as
 * the corpus grows).
 *
 * **The names are explicit because the old call sites were NOT interchangeable,
 * and looked it.** `BASE` above is the repo's real `canonicalUrl` — and the
 * `exporting ANOTHER instance's graph` block USED TO declare its own `BASE` of
 * `https://example.invalid/fa`, shadowing it. So the identical text
 * `buildExport({ baseUrl: BASE })` meant two different things depending on which
 * block it sat in: a canonical export in one and a preview in the other, which the
 * self-identification test distinguishes by `@type` and its 968 `alternateOf`
 * links. Collapsing those eight calls by counting matching call TEXT would have
 * swapped one for the other silently — the same trap as "a matching failure count
 * is not a matching failure set".
 *
 * The shadowing is now GONE rather than documented: that block reads `ALT_BASE`,
 * so there is one declaration of each base and the hazard cannot recur. This

/**
 * A package's id comes from its MANIFEST, and two directories cannot merge

 *
 * ## The failure this pins, measured 2026-09-20
 *
 * The id was `dir.split("/").pop()` — the directory basename. Eleven of the
 * twelve packages hid that, because their directory is named after the
 * package. The twelfth was `bootstrap/skills/`, whose manifest declares
 * `"name": "bootstrap"` and whose node was `package/skills`, **named
 * `skills`**.
 *
 * `cat-harness/src/skills/` has the same basename, so both wanted
 * `package/skills`, and a `seen` set dropped whichever arrived second while
 * its skills went on emitting `inPackage -> package/skills`. The result was a
 * node with five members: bootstrap's skills plus `corpus-grep`, a
 * cat-harness skill from a directory with **no manifest at all**, published as
 * a member of a package it was never listed in.
 *
 * Nothing reported it, and that is the part worth a test rather than a fix.
 * Both sides resolved. No link dangled. The audit's `skill-servable` criterion
 * was SATISFIED by the collision — the skill was "served" because a package it
 * had nothing to do with happened to exist. Every signal said healthy.
 *
 * These assert the OUTCOME (the two packages are distinct and carry the right
 * members) and the MECHANISM (the id tracks the declared name). An outcome
 * test alone would go on passing if the resolver silently reverted to
 * basenames, because `bootstrap/skills` and `src/skills` are the only pair
 * in this corpus that collide — and the day somebody renames one, the outcome
 * test would pass over a corpus with nothing left to detect.
