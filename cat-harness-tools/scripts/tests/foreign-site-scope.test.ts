/**
 * A folio's site describes the FOLIO, not the platform (#2263).
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-06, on https://litlfred.github.io/smart-trust/: *"the beans
 * and todos badges seems to be countts from folio-assistant and not
 * litlfred/smart-trust as expected. links to beans and todos dont work. why
 * not? fix process and skills."*
 *
 * Nothing caught it because every check ran on the PLATFORM's own site, where
 * the platform's tiles are right by construction. These tests run the two
 * foreign-site passes — the IG site's chrome shell (`compose-docs --shell`)
 * and the injected rail (`rail-standalone-pages --foreign-site`) — over a
 * FOLIO, and assert the two halves of the rule:
 *
 *   (a) the tiles describe the folio's instance: no other instance's count,
 *       and no other instance's state graph linked;
 *   (b) no href is left root-relative unless it is the folio's own path,
 *       resolved inside the folio's baseurl.
 *
 * And the same rule for a FIGURE that is not a tile (the #2263 follow-up):
 *
 *   (c) the platform's translation sweep and index are not shipped as the
 *       folio's, and the sweep badge is told what to SAY instead
 *       ("Swept 49/689" on every page of an IG folio's site was the platform's);
 *   (d) the fsh-guts icon is not this site's trashcan unless the folio links
 *       its own, so its count is not fetched from a site that has none
 *       (it showed "?").

// Neither is committed. Until 2026-10-15 this file read whatever an earlier
// `derive:publish` had left in the tree — CI's step before `bun test`, or
// another file's hook (`staging-only-publish` ran the whole of it until
// a1794c8) — so in a checkout with no such run, or alone, the describes below
// threw ENOENT at collection, and over a build in the wrong order they read a
// harness.json with no smart-trust rail scope.
//
// So this file builds what it reads, and only that: the writers the
// declarations name for those two artefacts, in `derive:publish`'s own order
// (`declaredPlan`, consumers first — smart-trust:pages before docs:pages and
// docs:harness), run the way it runs them (`runWriter`). About 10 s, against
// the whole `derive:publish`'s 300 s and more. At module scope, not in a
// hook, because the describes compute their fixtures at collection time.
// The writers resolve their paths from the checkout they belong to, so they
// write into this tree's ignored, publish-time paths, as a site build does.
//
// And it takes away again what it ADDED, once its tests have run. `docs:pages`
// writes far more than harness.json (the todos pages, the bean and QA
// projections, the witnesses under test/results/) and smart-trust:pages a
// whole site; a test file run after this one in the same `bun test` must see
// the tree it would have seen without it. pr-tests.yml runs no
// `derive:publish`, so left behind they gave every later file a tree main's
// run never has: "Tests (no new failures)" went red on PR #306, and locally
// compose-docs' "the cut, on the REAL tree" passes with them absent and
// fails with them present. A path that existed before is left as the
// writers made it: they are deterministic over the same inputs (harness.json
// rebuilt twice is byte-identical).
//
// Where they cannot be built — a layer standing alone without smart-trust
// (the standalone ratchet), or no state mounted — this says why and builds
// nothing, and the tests that read the data fail on their own, by name, as
// they do without it; it does not turn the whole file into one load error.
