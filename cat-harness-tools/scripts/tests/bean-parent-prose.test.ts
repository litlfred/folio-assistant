/**
 * `check:bean-parent-prose` — does a bean's body name a parent its front matter
 * does not carry?
 *
 * Bean `tlj9`. `4ccr`'s body said *"It belongs to the rendered-surface stream,
 * `folio-assistant-10uc`"* while its front matter carried no `parent`, so every
 * consumer that walks `parent` omitted the epic and its 23 open descendants from
 * GOAL 2 — 24 open items including `ob3m`, the navbar findings that prompted the
 * session which found it.
 *
 * ## What these tests hold
 *
 * **The scope is justified by a RATIO, and the ratio is asserted.** Bean bodies
 * cross-reference each other constantly, so a loose detector would fire across a
 * fifth of the store. The report prints `N of M` placement claims against id
 * mentions, and a test fails if the placement count ever approaches the mention
 * count — that is the signal the phrase set has stopped discriminating, and the
 * response is to narrow it rather than accept the findings.
 *
 * **Quotations are not claims.** `tlj9`'s own body quotes `4ccr`'s sentence as
 * evidence. Without the blockquote skip the bean that reports the defect reports
 * itself, and the candidate set is 2 rather than 1. A test pins the skip.
 *
 * **An empty domain is not a clean sweep.** With `4ccr`'s prose corrected there
 * are zero placement claims, so the check compares nothing. It still exits 0 —
 * no bean asserting a placement is a fine state — but it must SAY so, the same
 * distinction `check:instance-themes` draws.
 *
 * **One reader of the store.** It uses `readBeans`, whose `beansIn` is
 * deliberately non-recursive so `beans/defs/archive/` (631 terminal beans with
 * its own declaration and reader) does not fold into the count. A hand-rolled
 * directory walk here would have swept them in — and `check-bean-parents.ts`'s
 * own import comment records that every other script had grown its own parser
 * before that was consolidated.
