/**
 * Unit tests for the voice QA checkers' false-positive fixes
 * (litlfred/folio-assistant #41):
 *
 *   1. `checkEditorializing` — the "naturally occurring" domain-phrase
 *      exemption must be a STRIP (not a whole-line skip), so a genuine
 *      editorializing term elsewhere on the same line is still caught.
 *   2. `checkWallSide`'s tests moved with the checker to
 *      https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant-sci/blob/main/scripts/tests/qa-checkers-wall.test.ts
 *      (bean saqd, row 9).
 *
 * Run via `bun test`.
 *
 * The tests here whose subject is folio-assistant-sci's contribution (the
 * `milnorlink` entry in this instance's library) live in
 * `folio-assistant-sci/scripts/tests/qa-checkers-voice.test.ts` (bean `ho66`):
 * standing alone, cat-harness has no such contribution to read.
