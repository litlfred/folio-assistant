/**
 * `compose-docs.ts` — bean `n0nf`, issue #638, the owner's compose ruling.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/compose-docs
 * @graphNode none — a test
 *
 * ## The assertion this file exists for
 *
 * **An empty overlay must compose to a byte-identical tree.** `docs-site.yml`
 * publishes the real site, so changing its `source:` changes what readers get.
 * If composing with nothing in the overlay is provably the same bytes as the
 * base alone, wiring the composition in is a no-op until somebody deliberately
 * authors an override — and the risk is bounded to that moment rather than to
 * the commit that rewires the publish path.
 *
 * That property is checked against the REAL tree, not a fixture, because a
 * fixture proves the algorithm and the publish path runs on the real one.
 *
 * ## Everything else is checked on fixtures, and both directions
 *
 * An overlay that silently shadows a page is `dh4f`: a consumer reads the
 * composed tree, sees one file, and cannot tell an override from the only
 * copy. So "it overrode" and "it SAID it overrode" are separate assertions,
 * and a composer that did the first without the second would pass one of them.
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (reads the root
 * layer's declaration, which declares the `root-docs` layer) live in
 * `test/compose-docs-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it.
