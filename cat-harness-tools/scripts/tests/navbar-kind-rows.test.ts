/**
 * The graph-typology rows a REAL instance's rail is built from declare themselves
 * kind rows (#2151).
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-05: *"alignment of harnesses is off"*. `fa-nav-kind`, the
 * strip-column indent, used to be inferred from "has an SVG glyph", and #2122
 * gave harness rows glyph marks too. It is now `NavItem.kind`, set by
 * `graphTypologyRowDecor`. `cat-harness/scripts/tests/navbar.test.ts` asserts the
 * markup from rows built by that function directly. This file asserts that
 * `declaredGraphs` threads the field through for a real instance.
 *
 * It lives HERE, not beside navbar.test.ts, because it reads who-iris's
 * declaration, which a standalone cat-harness layer does not carry
 * (`check:cat-harness-standalone`).
