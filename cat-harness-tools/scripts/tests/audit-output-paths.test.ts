/**
 * Machine-generated audit output must not land in `beans/` or `todos/`,
 * and benchmark runners must not write into declared graph directories.
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` is explicit about both:
 *
 * - *"Do not stand up a separate todo store (no API route, dashboard, or
 *   `todos/*.json` work-plan); beans is it."*
 * - *"`beans ≠ sidecars`: never `beans create` bulk machine-generated queues
 *   … keep those as bulk JSON."* — `beans/` holds the work plan, not bulk
 *   output.
 *
 * Four pipeline scripts defaulted into those two directories anyway. Nothing
 * noticed, because every one of them was unreachable from a scaffolded folio
 * until the pipeline-resolution fix; the first run after it dirtied the
 * folio's git status with two files in forbidden locations.
 *
 * `build/` is gitignored in every folio layout, including what `folio_init`
 * scaffolds — `todos/` was not, which is why the docstring claiming otherwise
 * was wrong outside the `qou` repo it was written in.
 *
 * Benchmark runners (issue #363, bean folio-assistant-wp49):
 * Benchmarking output is a report about model performance across configurations,
 * and is deliberately excluded from declared KG graphs. Runners default output
 * to `build/benchmarks/` and are guarded against writing to any declared graph.
