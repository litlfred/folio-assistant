  Scenario: Subscribing to a valid substrate writes an entry with nothing chosen and a snapshot with fixity
    Given a subscriber layer with a substrate-snapshot directory
    When it subscribes to the ihris-kb substrate at a full SHA
    Then the entry is id "ihris-kb", repository "litlfred/ihris-kb" and the SHA, and nothing else
    And the declaration's other lines are left as they were
    And the declaration parses with exactly that subscription
    And subscriptions/ihris-kb.substrate.json parses as a snapshot whose digest is the sha256 of its raw bytes
    And its raw bytes are the substrate declaration and its summary names harness "ihris-kb"
    And the snapshot has no top-level name

  Scenario: Moving the pin updates an entry with nothing chosen and refuses one with parts chosen
    Given a layer subscribed to the ihris-kb substrate
