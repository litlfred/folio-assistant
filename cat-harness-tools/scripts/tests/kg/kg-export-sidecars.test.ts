/**
 * `kg-export.ts --check` / `--sidecars` — the committed QA sidecars as a
 * verify/write pair (bean `v556`).
 *
 * `kg-export` wrote two committed `qa-results/v1` sidecars and had no
 * `--check`, so no gate could see them drift. Measured on `main` `cf3e624`:
 * `kg-export.bootstrap.qa-results.json` recorded `script_hash` `47109f5daf3d`
 * against a true `e95fab417728`, and was hiding three `undeclaredSchemaModules`
 * findings, with every gate green.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the SUBJECT set, because that is the half a gate can
 * get silently wrong: a check that compares the host's sidecar and forgets the
 * foreign ones passes over exactly the file that was stale. The comparison
 * itself is `qaResultState`, tested in `qa-results.test.ts`; the end-to-end run
 * is the CI step `kg:export:check`.
