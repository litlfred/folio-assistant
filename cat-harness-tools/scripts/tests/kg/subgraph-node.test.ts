/**
 * THE GATE for the subgraph-node pattern (bean `l4ay`, follow-up `r5wu`):
 * a generator that publishes the contents of a declared subgraph uses the
 * DECLARED Subgraph node as its container, and every member says it is part of it.
 *
 * `PUBLISHED` lists the documents / publishers that have adopted the pattern.
 *
 * Pattern taxonomy:
 * - "container": published as a standalone named graph whose container is the declared Subgraph node (`@type: Subgraph`, `hasPart`, `contentSource`) with member `inSubgraph` edges (`todos`, `fsh-guts`).
 * - "scheme": published as a domain document (SKOS ConceptScheme) linked to the declared Subgraph via `dcterms:isPartOf` (`swimlane-glossary`).
 * - "members": published as individual document nodes whose manifest / root carries `inSubgraph` pointing to the declared Subgraph (`library`, `docs`).
 *
 * Internal authoring stores and plain JSON indexes that are NOT standalone published subgraph documents:
 * - `scenarios/roles.json` (`roles`): An internal authoring registry for BPMN swimlanes, projected directly into the instance KG export (`kg-export.ts`) rather than published as an independent JSON-LD document.
 * - `beans` (`beans/`): The work-plan items are maintained as an internal store and exposed via CLI (`beans prime`/`list`) and plain JSON indexes, not published as a standalone JSON-LD graph.
 * - `qa` (`test/results/`): QA witness files and attestations are machine sidecars and branch-store records (on `qa-reports`), not published standalone Subgraph documents.
