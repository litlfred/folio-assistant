/**
 * The harness's plug-in contract names no content type.
 *
 * Bean `jcmx`. `src/types.ts` is the interface each content adapter
 * implements, and it imported `FeedbackItem` and `PaperMacro` from
 * `schemas/types.ts`. Core may import the harness; the harness may not import
 * core. That single import was the LAST wrong-direction edge in the
 * partition, and it is the one the partition tool's own notes deferred
 * rather than acted on, because "splitting `ContentAdapter` out moves the
 * edge rather than removing it".
 *
 * It does — which is why the fix was not a split. Every content SHAPE
 * (`FolioItem`, `ContentOutline`, `Resolved*`) is DECLARED in `src/types.ts`,
 * not imported; only two symbols ever came from core. They are now declared
 * as the structural minimum a harness signature needs (`TodoRef`,
 * `MacroDef`), which the richer core types satisfy.
