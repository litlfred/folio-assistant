/**
 * `check:instance-themes` — the gate that truly covers the `themes` kind.
 *
 * Bean `z6xd`: three gates declared `@covers themes` while none of them
 * resolved a themes directory, so the kind read `covered` over ground nothing
 * reached. These tests hold the three things that made that possible.
 *
 * **The declaration must match the scan set.** The strongest test here is not
 * about this script at all: it asserts that exactly one script in the corpus
 * declares `@covers themes`, and that the one which does resolves a themes
 * directory. The original defect was written from a script's TITLE, which no
 * amount of reading the script would have caught.
 *
 * **One answer, not two.** The gate calls `instanceThemes` — the same
 * resolution every generator renders a theme reference through. A gate that
 * re-derived it would be free to disagree with the pages, which is `z6xd`'s own
 * defect one layer along, so a test asserts the import.
 *
 * **Kinds are reported and never graded.** The board styles a card only from
 * `sticky` themes, and whether an instance authors one is the owner's call
 * (#1584; answered for who-iris on 2026-09-30, bean `v8n5`). So a green run over
 * a missing `sticky` is CORRECT and a test pins it, over a fixture instance: a
 * check that failed would be answering a question its author was told not to.

 * `coversIn` stops the kind list at the em-dash and treats the rest as prose,
 * so `@covers none — it reads `THEMES`, the platform's themes` declares
 * exactly `none`. The lookalike split the whole line on whitespace, found the
 * word "themes" in the REASON, and reported gen-themes-css as still claiming
 * the kind. That is the `vq8g` defect — a detector that recognises one form and
 * calls the corpus wrong — committed inside the test written to catch it. Use
 * the parser the verdict is actually computed from.
