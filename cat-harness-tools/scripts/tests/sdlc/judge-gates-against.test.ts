/**
 * Every judge-mode gate of bean `oqe3` passes `--against main` in its own
 * package script.
 *
 * A gate in judge mode decides NEW against inherited findings from a baseline.
 * Without `--against` it has no baseline and reports UNKNOWN, which is not
 * gated. So a script missing the flag can never fail on a new finding when it
 * runs locally or through `bun run cat gates`. Before this test,
 * `check:term-mapping`, `check:reference-direction:check` and
 * `check:harness-state:check` all took the flag but none of their scripts
 * passed it. Only the index's CI passed it, and only for reference-direction.
 * This is where to add the next one.
