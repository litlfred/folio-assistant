/**
 * A `publish: "staging-only"` visualisation reaches a preview and never the
 * canonical deploy.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-21, on `fsh-guts`: **render it, exclude it from canonical.**
 * They had asked to see a graph whose own declaration says it is
 * *"DELIBERATELY absent from the rendered site … so that something can be kept
 * without being published"*, and both halves were meant.
 *
 * ## Why these assertions are shaped the way they are
 *
 * This feature fails in two directions and they are not symmetric. Withholding
 * too much loses a page from a preview, where the person looking at the
 * preview sees it missing. Withholding too little **publishes content somebody
 * chose not to publish**, which is visible nowhere in the build and is not
 * undone by deleting the page afterwards.
 *
 * So the default is tested as hard as the feature: a compose with NO options
 * must withhold. A test that only ever passed an explicit flag would pass just
 * as happily if the default were reversed, which is the single most expensive
 * thing that could be wrong here.
 *
 * The layer-root guard has its own test for the same reason. A visualiser ref
 * sitting directly in `cat-harness/docs/` is an ordinary declaration, and
 * without the guard one such ref marked staging-only would withhold `""` —
 * emptying the canonical deploy. That is a whole-site outage reachable from a
 * one-word declaration, and it is exactly the kind of thing that is obvious
 * once written down and invisible until then.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/tests/staging-only-publish.test
 *
 * The tests that read the real declaration and compose the real tree live in
 * `cat-harness-tools/test/coordinator/staging-only-publish-repo-root.test.ts`
 * (bean `ho66`). The ones that read the index repository's own
 * `.github/workflows/` — that the preview composes with `--staging` and the
 * canonical publisher without it — live in that repository's
 * `test/workflows/staging-only-publish.test.ts` (owner's ruling 2026-10-09,
 * litlfred/folio-assistant#2521, ruling 1(c)). The ones that read the
 * `fsh-guts` trashcan, kept on a state branch only a composed checkout
 * mounts, report themselves not applicable standing alone.
