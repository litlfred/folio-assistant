/**
 * `backoff-sleep.ts` is imported for its constants by `qa-store.ts`, which the
 * qa-checkers reach through `qa-utils` -> `qa-results`. An `await` in its
 * `import.meta.main` block is a TOP-LEVEL await, which makes the module async;
 * in an index checkout `harness-config`'s synchronous `require()` of an
 * instance's plugin table then failed while the checkers were loading
 * ("require() async module ... is unsupported"), and every script importing
 * `qa-checkers-extended` crashed at load. Read statically: the failure needs
 * the index's instances, which a standalone checkout of this layer has not got.
