/**
 * The todo graph is declared, present, and READ.
 *
 * All three, because the failure mode is the middle one going missing.
 * `schemas/sdlc/todo.ts`, `schemas/sdlc/todo-graph.ts` and the `todos` / `todo-items`
 * graph typologies existed before any todo did, and `harness.json` did not
 * declare `todos/`. A schema ahead of its graph is harmless. A **declared
 * directory nothing reads** is the bean `dh4f` defect — a consumer scans
 * nothing and reports a clean run over it.
 *
 * The tests here that read the aggregate repository's own root (the
 * root-declared `todos/` and `beans/` graphs, and the processes every instance
 * stacks) live in `test/todos-repo-root.test.ts`
 * (bean `ho66`): standing alone, cat-harness has no such root to read.
