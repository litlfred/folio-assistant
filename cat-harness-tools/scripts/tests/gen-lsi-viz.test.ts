/**
 * The Indexing evidence page works for its reader (cat-harness#1144): every
 * indexing method has its section with its held evidence and the skills that
 * apply it, each skill row carries its Tools and processes, an indexing skill
 * with no method is listed as having no evidence yet, and every table row has
 * the columns its header promises.
 *
 * Drawn over a FIXTURE model, so nothing here depends on what the checkout
 * holds. The test over the whole checkout is in
 * `test/coordinator/gen-lsi-viz-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`).
