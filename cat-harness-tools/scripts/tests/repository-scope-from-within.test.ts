/**
 * A repository-scoped store's nested declarations get an owner.
 *
 * `promoteFromWithin` never follows a `scope: "repository"` entry, because
 * such an entry usually points at ANOTHER instance's directory, and what that
 * directory declares from within belongs to its owner. In the index checkout
 * there is no other owner. Its root declares no instance (owner, 2026-10-08),
 * so `beans/beans.json`'s `defs` and `todos/todos.json`'s `items` were
 * attributed to `(root)`, an instance that does not exist (measured
 * 2026-10-09). These tests pin both halves: an undeclared root lets the
 * declarer own the nested entries, and a declared root keeps them away.
