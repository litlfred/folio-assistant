/**
 * `9x01` box 63 and 66 — a page may not claim a language a reader cannot read
 * it in, and the gate that says so must be able to fail.
 *
 * The corpus tests are the ones that would have caught the defect. The unit
 * tests are the ones that would have caught the two ways I got the *check*
 * wrong before it went green: resolving a translated page by its own key, and
 * treating an unreadable index as an empty one.
 *
 * ## Why the corpus assertion is safe to read from the working tree
 *
 * `generated-banner-commands.test.ts` had to read `HEAD` instead of the disk,
 * because `bun test` runs files in parallel and this repository has tests that
 * spawn generators in their WRITING form — the `ymsu` signature, where a test
 * passes alone and fails in the suite. That hazard does not apply here, and the
 * reason is worth stating rather than assumed: the property under test is
 * invariant under regeneration. `gen-docs-pages.ts` now computes
 * `available_locales` from the translation index, so a page rewritten
 * mid-suite is rewritten with a CORRECT claim. A concurrent generator can
 * change the file and cannot change the verdict.
