/**
 * Process_BeanDrain (cat-harness `sdlc/processes/bean-drain.bpmn`, bean
 * `bssi`) walked through the engine: build the queue, then per bean OPEN →
 * work → CLOSE, then refill.
 *
 * The drain is the one caller that reaches OPEN and CLOSE more than once in
 * an instance, so it rests on two engine properties no other walk asserts:
 * a call activity reached again by a gateway loop RE-ENTERS its process
 * (`enterSubprocesses`), and a CLOSE with more of the caller still ahead does
 * not leave the instance believing it is finished — the drain is not done
 * when one bean is.
