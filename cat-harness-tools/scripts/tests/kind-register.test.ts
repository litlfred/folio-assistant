/**
 * Every artefact a new graph KIND owes — the chain, and the two a person writes.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/kind-register.test
 *
 * ## What this pins, against what it deliberately does not
 *
 * The command's value is that it names **the kind**, where every underlying
 * check names a generated file. Measured on #2022: adding `auto-docs`, six
 * hand-picked `check:*` commands passed while `bun run gates` found 5 failures
 * across 217 and `bun test` found two more — and not one of those failures said
 * "auto-docs". So the assertions below are about the KIND appearing in the
 * finding, not about any artefact's content.
 *
 * It does not assert a hue rule, because measuring the corpus removed one: 11
 * exact collisions across 58 kinds, all deliberate, two of them saying *"in WHO
 * blue"* in their own `reads` string. See `hueReport`.
