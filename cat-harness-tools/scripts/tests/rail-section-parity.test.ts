/**
 * ONE VOCABULARY FOR THE RAIL'S SECTIONS, on both paths that draw one —
 * owner, 2026-10-15, "folio rail everywhere" (bean `9rq1`: a capability that
 * exists on one layout and not another is a defect, not a design).
 *
 * - Path A, the just-the-docs sidebar: `docs-ui.js` builds "On this page",
 *   "Pages" and "Folders" in the browser; `gen-navbar-include.ts` writes
 *   "Harnesses" through `navbarRegionsHtml`.
 * - Path B, the `nav.fa-nav` rail: `railModel` → `navbarRegionsHtml`, on the
 *   server and (bundled as `navbar.js`) in the browser.
 *
 * Until 2026-10-15 Path B said "Graphs" and "Contents" for the sections Path A
 * called "Folders" and "On this page". Then the owner chose ONE rail on every
 * page (option A): the theme sidebar is replaced after Jekyll and Path A's
 * browser-built sections are retired. So this holds two things: the rail
 * draws the whole vocabulary, read off its rendered `<summary>` labels, and
 * `docs-ui.js` draws none of it a second time.
