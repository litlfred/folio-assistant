/**
 * `check:merged` must tell its two non-zero cases apart — bean `qook`, second
 * route.
 *
 * `bun run gates` exits 1 both when a gate FAILS and when every gate passes but
 * one of them WROTE to the tree (`ymsu`). `check-merged.ts` branched on
 * `gates.status !== 0` alone, so it printed "the MERGED tree fails the gates …
 * regenerate what the failing gates name" for both — naming gates that did not
 * exist and advice that could not be followed. Measured 2026-09-27 on
 * `claude/qook-verify-backwards`: every gate passed, 1 gate changed the tree,
 * and that was the message.
 *
 * ## Why the exit code is NOT the discriminator, and must not become one
 *
 * The obvious fix — make the mutation path exit 2, which `check:merged`
 * already treats as could-not-determine — is WRONG here, and #1363 says why in
 * its own scope: the guard makes `ymsu` clause 1 "visible and FATAL", on
 * purpose, so the writing gate gets fixed instead of tolerated. Softening it
 * would defeat the guard exactly where it works. So the discrimination is made
 * by OBSERVATION instead, which this script can afford because it owns the
 * merge worktree.
