/**
 * Landing data for the CHECKOUT-ROOT instance never reads outside the checkout.
 *
 * Measured 2026-10-15, publishing litlfred/smart-ra from `~/space_cats/smart-ra`:
 * `gen-landing-data` resolved sticky themes against `repoRootFor(ROOT)`, which
 * is `dirname`. For a folio whose landing IS the repository that is the
 * directory holding the clone, so `themeByRef` scanned every sibling clone and
 * the build died on a stranger's declaration —
 * `qou/qou.json: directory "lake-cache" declares unknown graph typology`.
 *
 * The fixture is that machine in miniature: a parent directory holding an
 * unrelated, INVALID declaration (sorted first, so the old scan reaches it
 * before anything else) beside a git checkout whose root instance is the
 * landing. The build must succeed and must carry the root's own card — the
 * second assertion is what keeps the first from passing on an empty board.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/gen-landing-data-root-instance.test
