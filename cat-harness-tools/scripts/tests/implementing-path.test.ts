/**
 * Owner rulings T1 and T7 (2026-10-01, bean `70lx`): a path the harness
 * DECLARES — a Tool's `invoke.inProcess.module`, a criterion's `source_file`,
 * a render target's `module` — stays as written, and is resolved against the
 * instance that IMPLEMENTS the declarer, found through that instance's own
 * `needs`. These tests pin the resolver the code move relies on, so that every
 * later batch is a pure `git mv`.
 *
 * Here rather than in the harness because the property only matters once
 * this layer exists, and a test in the harness importing it would be the
 * wrong direction.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/implementing-path.test
