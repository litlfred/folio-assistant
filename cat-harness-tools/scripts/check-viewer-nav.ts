/**
 * The viewer-navbar audit: which generated viewer pages carry a nav rail.
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat viewer:nav:audit    # write the sidecar
 * bun run cat check:viewer-nav    # GATED: fail on a REGRESSION and nothing else
 * bun run cat viewer:nav:strict   # an author's check: staleness and every finding
 * ```
 *
 * The gate fails only on a **regression** (a page that was railed and is not
 * any more, or a newly appearing layout flag), which is always the diff's
 * author. Staleness is not gated: the audit walks the whole docs tree, so a
 * page added anywhere makes the sidecar stale on every open branch; the gate
 * prints it as a note. A page that never had a rail, a `missing` page, and
 * staleness are `strict`'s, run by the author.
 *
 * The committed sidecar is the record, so a diff shows whether a page lost its
 * rail in this commit or never had one.
 *
 * The regression is computed against a prior verdict: the committed working
 * copy, or with `--against <ref>` the `qa-reports` branch. A prior that is not
 * there is printed `unknown` (the regression half not run), never a failure.
 * `--strict` still fails on every `missing` page, which needs no prior.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-viewer-nav
 * @covers docs — it walks the whole docs tree, one finding per generated viewer page whose
 *   navbar regressed
