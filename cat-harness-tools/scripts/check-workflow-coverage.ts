/**
 * Which GitHub Actions workflows are documented as BPMN, and which are not?
 *
 * @module scripts/check-workflow-coverage
 * @covers processes
 *
 * A workflow DECLARES its diagram, `# bpmn: cat-harness/processes/x.bpmn` at
 * the top (`workflow-bpmn.ts`); nothing is inferred from a filename or a
 * mention. The pointer is on the workflow because it depends on the process.
 *
 * Drift: a job that stands for a node declares it (`# bpmn-node: Start_PR`
 * inside the job), and the two are compared in **both** directions. Declaring
 * is OPT-IN per workflow: a covered workflow whose jobs name no node is
 * reported as undeclared, not drifted; SOME jobs naming a node never reads as
 * complete.
 *
 * - **covered** — the workflow names a diagram that exists.
 * - **uncovered** — it names none. A determined absence.
 * - **unknown** — the workflow could not be PARSED. Never rendered as
 *   covered, and it is what `--strict` fails on first.
 * - A workflow naming a diagram that is not there is reported as dangling.
 *
 * Coverage is reported per trigger class (auto-triggered vs
 * `workflow_dispatch`/`workflow_call`-only); `--auto` narrows the gate to
 * workflows that fire on their own. `--strict` has no `package.json` alias
 * until a workflow runs it.
 *
 * Usage:  bun run cat check:workflow-coverage [--auto] [--strict]
 * Exit:   0 clean · 1 a workflow names a diagram that is not there, or drifted
 *         2 a workflow could not be read — COULD NOT DETERMINE
 *         With `--strict`, an uncovered workflow is also exit 1.
