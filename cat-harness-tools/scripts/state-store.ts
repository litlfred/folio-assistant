/**
 * state-store — a DECLARED tip-keyed directory, read and spliced by id.
 *
 * @module scripts/state-store
 * @graphNode none — a reader/writer over a declared `storage` directory
 *
 * Bean `2h76` part 3, arc `fs43`. {@link BranchStore} knows how to read and
 * splice a branch; this knows WHICH branch, from the declaration, and talks in
 * paths relative to the directory rather than to the branch root.
 *
 * ## Why a second module and not more methods on `BranchStore`
 *
 * `BranchStore` takes a branch NAME. Every caller that hardcodes one is a
 * caller that has to be edited when a branch is renamed — and one rename is
 * already in flight (`state` to `cat/cat-harness/state`, bean `32f6`), which
 * is why `BranchStore.open` takes ordered candidates at all. A caller here
 * names a DIRECTORY ID, {@link resolveTipLocation} answers with the branch its
 * declaration gives, and the rename becomes a one-line change to the
 * declaration.
 *
 * It also fixes the path frame. On a tip-keyed branch the paths mirror the
 * checkout, so `beans/defs/x.md` in the working tree is `beans/defs/x.md` on
 * the branch. A caller holding a bean id should not have to know its
 * directory's prefix to read it, so everything here is relative to the
 * directory and {@link StateStore.branchPath} does the joining.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * No manifest validation, no tip verification, no JSON parsing, no retry over
 * a moved tip: `BranchStore` does all of that, and a second copy of a
 * correctness check is a second thing to get wrong. Bean `2h76` part 1 removed
 * one such duplicate from this arc already.
 *
 * It also never merges content. A write carries `expect` — the blob id its
 * author read — and a tip that disagrees comes back `conflict` with the paths
 * named. {@link StateStore.update} is the one place a retry happens, and it
 * retries by RE-READING and re-applying the caller's function, so the new
 * content is computed from what is actually on the branch. That is the
 * difference between resolving a race and silently winning one.
 *
 * ## Not wired to anything yet
 *
 * No declaration sets `storage` (see `DirectoryStorageSchema`), so
 * {@link StateStore.openFor} throws for every id today and that is correct:
 * `main` stays authoritative until the cutover (Phase 3, bean `9ofm`).
 * {@link StateStore.at} takes an explicit location, which is what the tests
 * and the cutover use before any declaration exists.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/state-store.ts where --id <directory-id>
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/state-store.ts read  --id <id> <path>
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/state-store.ts ls    --id <id> [<path>]
