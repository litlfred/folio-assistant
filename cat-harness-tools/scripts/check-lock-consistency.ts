/**
 * Where the locks in a composition pin DIFFERENT commits of a shared lower
 * layer: a report, never a gate (owner, 2026-11-13, "3y 1y": only the
 * top-level lock decides; see "Since 2026-11-13" below).
 *
 * @module scripts/check-lock-consistency
 * @graphNode none — a check over the index's lock and the locks of the layers it mounts
 *
 * An index mounts layers that have locks of their own: cat-harness pins
 * bootstrap, an index above it pins bootstrap AND cat-harness. When the two
 * pin different commits of bootstrap, everything cat-harness computed from
 * bootstrap and committed (its glossaries, for one) is stale in the index,
 * and the index's writers rewrite those files inside the mount on every run.
 * Measured 2026-11-06 (bean `cat-tools-sm8r`): bootstrap a83ae82d in
 * cat-harness's lock against c90ef456 in the index's, and every
 * later `state:mount` in a local gate run read cat-harness as edited. The
 * owner's ruling was "align pins"; this check keeps them aligned, red
 * instead of silent.
 *
 * ## Since 2026-11-13
 *
 * A composition mounts each layer once, at the top-level index's pin; the
 * locks inside the mounted layers are not read by the mount. So a skew this
 * report lists is what a lower layer was last tested with, not a defect, and
 * it is no longer a gate to be turned on after the re-pin (the "align pins"
 * ruling below is replaced). The stale committed files it caught move to
 * build time under option 3 of the same ruling.
 *
 * ## The rule (as reported)
 *
 * For each layer A the index's lock pins at commit `a`, and each mounted
 * layer L whose OWN lock (at the commit the index pins L) pins A at `b`:
 * `a === b`, or it is a finding. A layer L pins that the index does not
 * mount is not compared.
 *
 * ## Which pairs it judges, and when it can be green
 *
 * Every pair: the index against EVERY mounted layer that has a lock, the
 * harness and the content layers alike, not only the layers below the
 * harness. Aligning the harness's own pins (cat-harness#1570, #1097) clears
 * the pairs against cat-harness; the content layers' locks hold older pins
 * that also disagree with each other today, so this check stays red until
 * the bottom-up re-pin of every layer has landed (owner: "align pins"). It
 * is run as a gate only after that.
 *
 * ## Where a layer's lock is read
 *
 * From the mount when it is on disk (`<L path>/index.lock.json`, laid down
 * when the mount holds the layer's root). Otherwise it is read from the
 * repository at the pinned commit. A lock that cannot be read is
 * could-not-determine (exit 2), never a pass; a layer with no lock pins
 * nothing and is not a finding.
 *
 *   bun run cat check:lock-consistency [--root <index>] [--gate | --strict]
 *
 * Exit 0 aligned (or skews reported without `--gate` / `--strict`), 1 a skew
 * with `--gate` / `--strict`, 2 could not determine.
