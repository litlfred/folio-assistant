/**
 * repin-standing — move every pin a STANDING consent covers to the newest
 * (or newest green) commit of the branch it follows, and record that rule's
 * consent for each new pin.
 *
 * @module scripts/repin-standing
 * @graphNode none — a scheduled maintenance step over a site's own `index.config.json`
 * @covers none — it moves pins; the mount (`remote-mount.ts`) and its trust
 * check judge what it moved, exactly as they judge a pin a person moved.
 *
 * Each site keeps its own lock. The rule and its trust semantics are the
 * harness's (`cat-harness/schemas/kg/mount-trust.ts`, "Standing consent"); this is
 * the implementation.
 *
 *   bun run cat mount:repin:standing                 # resolve, re-pin, re-mount (writes index.config.json + index.lock.json)
 *   bun run cat mount:repin:standing --dry-run       # resolve and print what WOULD move; write nothing
 *   bun run cat mount:repin:standing --no-mount      # write index.config.json only; run mount:remote yourself
 *   bun run cat mount:repin:standing --extend-from <old index.config.json>   # step 4a ONLY, after the pins moved
 *   ... --instance <root>   --depth <n>   --consent-on <YYYY-MM-DD>   --summary-file <f>   --no-install
 *
 * ## What it does, per layer
 *
 * 1. Reads the site's declared mounts through `readDeclaredMounts` and keeps
 *    those whose own `trust.standing` is declared.
 * 2. Resolves the followed branch through {@link GitHubApi} — the ONLY place
 *    this script reaches the network, so tests stub it. Without `require`, the
 *    candidate is the branch head; with `require: "green"`, the newest of the
 *    last `--depth` commits whose own combined status and check runs are green
 *    ({@link verdictOf}). None green: that layer does not move.
 * 3. Asks `standingCovers` (the harness's pure coverage decision) whether the
 *    rule covers the move. Not covered: reported, not moved.
 * 3a. The cascade ({@link alignToHeldPins}): a layer below the harness
 *    is not pinned to its branch head but to the commit the harness's own
 *    lock holds at the harness's new pin, because the harness commits
 *    artefacts generated from those pins (bootstrap's checklists).
 * 4. Moves the covered pins with `seedRemote` — the same write `mount:remote
 *    --seed` makes — with the rule's grant (`standingGrantOf`), so the consent
 *    for each new pin is written in the same write, by the rule's person,
 *    marked `standing`.
 * 4a. A NEWLY DECLARED directory ({@link extendExplicitDirectories}): where
 *    the site's override names the layer's directories explicitly, an id
 *    the new pin declares in the checkout and the old pin did not is added to
 *    that list, and the summary says so. The standing consent follows the
 *    branch, and a directory the layer adds comes with it. Without this a
 *    layer that declared a directory could never be re-pinned: the old list
 *    left the new directory absent (`check:declared-dirs`), and naming it
 *    before the move was refused at the old pin (folio-assistant#3023, a
 *    content layer that added three). Ids are only ever ADDED: one the site left out on
 *    purpose stays out, and nothing the site wrote is removed.
 * 5. Re-mounts with `mountRemote`, which rewrites `index.lock.json` and runs
 *    the trust check over every layer of the closure, and re-renders the
 *    agent surface when the lock changed (`afterMount`). A transitive layer
 *    whose consent does not cover its new pin is refused there, as always.
 *
 * Layers reached through a gitlink move with their parent's tree; a
 * `standing` rule on `overrides.<name>.trust` is not followed here.
 *
 * Exit: 0 when it finished (moved or nothing to move); 1 when the re-mount
 * reported a layer missing or refused; 2 when a branch or verdict could
 * not be determined, or a write failed.
