/**
 * A bean's STATUS must agree with its own subtree — and the stale-claim sweep.
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat check:bean-rollup            # the gate
 * bun run cat check:bean-rollup -- --sweep # + the claim-age report (never fails)
 * bun run cat check:bean-rollup -- --json
 * ```
 *
 * `in-progress` is the status every sibling session reads before deciding
 * whether a bean is free. An old `updated_at` does not make a claim stale:
 * nobody edits a milestone when a child moves, so a container's `updated_at`
 * measures EDITING, not liveness. And a bean with no children is a leaf
 * whatever its type, so {@link rollupFindings} requires `children.length > 0`
 * before it judges a container at all.
 *
 * ## What the GATE checks, and why it owns no clock
 *
 * Anything computed against the clock changes on every run and would turn CI
 * red with nobody having changed anything (the reason `beans.ts`
 * §`beanFindings` declines a stale-`in-progress` finding). So the gate is the
 * **pure graph** half: a bean's status against its children's.
 *
 * | rule | the contradiction |
 * |---|---|
 * | `open-container-closed-subtree` | open, has children, **none** open — it asserts live work its own subtree denies |
 * | `closed-container-open-subtree` | closed, and **some** child is open — the roadmap reads the area as finished |
 *
 * Existing contradictions whose resolution is the bean owner's judgement are
 * baselined.
 *
 * ## What `--sweep` reports, and what it refuses to conclude
 *
 * The sweep carries the clock, so it **never sets the exit code**. A leaf
 * claim is held by a session, a branch or a PR, none committed here, so
 * without `--github` the leaf buckets are one **unjudged** group:
 * could-not-check is never green, and never GUILTY either.
 *
 * `--github` (needs `GH_TOKEN`) asks the API for open PRs and splits the
 * leaves by whether one names the bean. That is a fact GitHub holds ABOUT this
 * repository rather than one the repository holds, so it is asked every run
 * and cached nowhere.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT claim
 *
 * A leaf with no open PR is a **candidate**, never a verdict: it may be real
 * work on an unpushed branch, in which case the answer is `bean-blocking`'s
 * four-field record (the form `check:bean-blocks` owns) rather than a
 * release. Nothing here changes a status or deletes a bean: unwanted work is
 * `scrapped`, with its reasons.
 *
 * @covers bean-defs, beans
