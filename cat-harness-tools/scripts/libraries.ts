/**
 * Software libraries — write each layer's `libraries/` from its lockfile, or
 * check that it is current.
 *
 * @module scripts/libraries
 * @covers software-library — it derives every node of each declared `libraries/` directory, vendored bundles included, and fails on a stale node, an import no node names, a shim no node names, and a vendored bundle whose bytes or manifest it cannot vouch for
 *
 * The kind is cat-harness's (`schemas/library/software-library.ts`, a node kind on the
 * `outside-software` core it shares with `tool-release`); this is its writer
 * and its gate.
 *
 *   bun run cat libraries:derive                       write every layer that declares a software-library directory
 *   bun run cat libraries:derive --instance <name>     write one (a held layer too: `--instance bootstrap-tools`)
 *   bun run cat libraries:check                        fail on anything `libraries:derive` would change, and on what it cannot place
 *
 * Exit 0 clean · 1 a finding · 2 nothing to judge (no layer declares a
 * `software-library` directory, which is `could not determine`, never a pass).
 *
 * ## Where each field comes from
 *
 * | field | from |
 * |---|---|
 * | `name`, `range`, `dev` | the layer's `package.json`: `dependencies` and `devDependencies` |
 * | `version`, `digest`, `source` | the layer's `bun.lock`: the package's resolved `name@version`, its `sha512-` integrity (re-spelled in hex), and its registry tarball |
 * | `licence` | the INSTALLED package's own `package.json` — `license`, or the old `licenses` array — found the way Node resolves it, from the layer upwards; when it says `SEE LICENSE IN <file>`, that file, read as a vendored bundle's is (a listed licence's text is its id, any other `LicenseRef-<name>`) |
 * | `usedBy` | every code file of the layer whose imports name the package (parsed with the TypeScript compiler, so an import inside a comment or a string is not one) |
 * | `shim` | the `types/*.d.ts` whose `declare module "<name>"` declares it |
 *
 * An import of `x` that no dependency declares is satisfied by a node for
 * `@types/x` (scoped: `@types/scope__x`), which is how a types-only package
 * is imported. The platform's own layers (`@litlfred/*`, and every workspace
 * of the lockfile) are not outside software, so they get no node and their
 * imports are not findings.
 *
 * The lockfile carries no licence, so it is read from the installed package.
 * In an index checkout that install is the index's, so its version can differ
 * from the one the layer locks; the node keeps the LOCKED version and the
 * difference is printed, never refused.
 *
 * ## What `--check` refuses
 *
 * 1. **A stale node** — one whose file differs from what `libraries:derive`
 *    would write, a dependency with no node, and a node with no dependency.
 * 2. **An import that names no node** — a file importing a package the layer
 *    does not declare. It works only because something else installed it.
 * 3. **A shim that names no node** — a `types/*.d.ts` declaring a module the
 *    layer does not depend on, so it types nothing that is installed.
 * 4. A node that does not parse, or whose licence is not a valid expression
 *    over the PINNED SPDX License List (`check:source-licence`'s parser).
 * 5. Anything the writer could not determine — no `bun.lock`, a dependency
 *    the lockfile does not resolve from a registry, a package that is not
 *    installed, or one that states no licence. Each is a finding, never a
 *    quietly skipped node.
 * 6. A vendored bundle with no manifest, a manifest that does not parse or
 *    disagrees with its directory, a kept file whose bytes are not the sha256
 *    its manifest records (the node's digest vouches for the tarball, so the
 *    bytes must be the tarball's), or no licence to read.
 *
 * ## A vendored bundle is a node too
 *
 * A layer may keep a library's prebuilt bytes rather than install them: one
 * directory per bundle, `vendor/<name>/<version>/`, anywhere in the layer,
 * holding the bytes, the package's own licence file and a `vendored.json`
 * manifest ({@link VendoredManifestSchema}: the npm `package`, `version`,
 * `tarball`, `integrity`, and a sha256 per kept file). Each bundle gets ONE
 * node, `software-library/1.1.0` with `vendored: { path }` and no `range` or `dev`:
 *
 * | field | from |
 * |---|---|
 * | `name`, `version` | the manifest's `package` and `version` (the directory's `<version>` must agree) |
 * | `digest`, `source` | the manifest's `integrity` (re-spelled in hex) and `tarball` |
 * | `licence`, `licenceSource` | the bundle's own `package.json` when it kept one; else its licence file (`LICENSE`, `COPYING`, or a font's `OFL.txt`) — a text recognised as a listed licence ({@link recogniseLicenceText}: MIT, or the SIL OFL 1.1 under a font's notice) is that id, and any other is `LicenseRef-<name>`, SPDX's own name for a licence the list does not carry, whose text is that file |
 *
 * A bundle's files are not read for imports (they are what the bundle was
 * built from, not this layer's imports), and `usedBy` is empty: what loads a
 * bundle is a page or a path string, never an import.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining

redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.
