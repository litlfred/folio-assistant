/**
 * Does every image a Tool declares install the DECLARED set, rather than a
 * list retyped beside it?
 *
 * Added 2026-09-21 after the two diverged in silence. The Dockerfile carried a
 * hand-maintained pip list that omitted 6 of the 10 declared packages —
 * `cffi`, `cryptography`, `pymupdf`, `pillow`, `pdfminer.six`, `pdfplumber` —
 * and the omission was invisible because `--check` only ever compared
 * `requirements.txt` against this schema. Both were internally consistent;
 * nothing asked whether the IMAGE installed what they agreed on.
 *
 * The cost is on `requirements.txt` itself, which has documented it since
 * 2026-09-19: without `cffi`, importing `cryptography` raises
 * `ModuleNotFoundError: _cffi_backend` and then panics under pyo3, so every
 * PDF backend fails at import time. The knowledge was written down and the
 * image did not read it.
 *
 * ## Which images (bean `ar1s`, phase 2)
 *
 * This read the ROOT `Dockerfile` until 2026-10-07 — the one image no workflow
 * built — while every image that WAS built retyped its own list, the exact
 * drift it was written for. An image is now part of the Tool that uses it: a
 * Tool's `install.container` is its `docker build` line, and the
 * `-f <Dockerfile>` there is the image checked. The set of images is the
 * declared one rather than a path chosen here, so deleting a Dockerfile cannot
 * turn this into a check of nothing — the Tool that declared it reports it
 * missing.
 *
 * ## What it asserts
 *
 * The WEAK property, deliberately: an image that pip-installs anything
 * installs a GENERATED requirements file (COPYed from its declared path), and
 * names no declared distribution on a pip line of its own. It does not parse
 * the generated file — a checker that re-derived the list would be a second
 * opinion about what is installed, free to disagree with the file it checks.
 * Wheels and build tools outside the declaration (`maturin`, a local `.whl`)
 * are not a retyped list and pass.
