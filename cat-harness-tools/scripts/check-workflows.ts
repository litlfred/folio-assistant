/**
 * Workflow YAML that GitHub will actually parse.
 *
 * ## Why a local check, when CI already runs the workflows
 *
 * Because a workflow GitHub cannot parse does not fail loudly — it produces a
 * run **named by its file path instead of its `name:`**, because there is no
 * `name:` to read. `AGENTS.md` records two workflows that failed this way on
 * 2026-08-07 and stayed red for a day. I reproduced it on 2026-09-18 by adding
 * a second `env:` block to a step that already had one.
 *
 * The trap is that **`yaml.safe_load` accepts duplicate keys** — the YAML spec
 * says they are invalid, but most loaders take the last one silently. So
 * "it parses locally" is not evidence, and that is exactly what I relied on.
 *
 * ## What is checked
 *
 * - **Duplicate keys at any level.** The failure above.
 * - **`${{ }}` inside a `run:` body**, where the expression is substituted into
 *   the script TEXT before the shell parses it. Trusted contexts are allowed;
 *   anything attacker-controlled is an error. See
 *   `skills/conduct/conduct-core/untrusted-input.md`.
 * - **A job that pushes `gh-pages` with no protection against the race.**
 *   Either the shared `gh-pages-push` concurrency group, or a retry. One or
 *   the other, because they all contend for a single ref.
 * - **A job that REPLACES the whole publish branch without carrying the open
 *   PRs' `STAGING/` previews across.** Bean `plj1`.
 * - **A push to `qa-reports` that does not go through `qa-store.ts`.** Bean
 *   `16ei`: `qa-reports-unretried`.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-workflows
 * @covers none — .github/workflows/ is not a declared graph typology

/**
 * A job that writes `gh-pages` must be protected against the race — **somehow**.
 *
 * ## The rule is "queue OR retry", and the first version got that wrong
 *
 * This check originally demanded the shared group, full stop. That is too
 * narrow, and #300 shipped a regression because of it: it put
 * `discoverability-docs`' three jobs into the group, and those three run **in
 * parallel with no `needs:`**.
 *
 * GitHub cancels a PENDING job when a newer one queues for the same group. All
 * three enter at once, so one runs, one pends, and the third cancels the
 * pending one — **a lost publish every run**, which is worse than the race it
 * replaces, because a cancelled job reads as intentional while a rejected push
 * is at least red. #300's own commit message stated that cancellation rule
 * about a different case and then did not apply it here; a sibling session
 * raised it on the PR before it landed (bean `pdxk`) and it was merged unseen.
 *
 * So the invariant is protection, not membership:
 *
 * - **queue** — `concurrency.group: gh-pages-push`. Correct when the contending
 *   jobs arrive at different times, which is the cross-workflow case.
 * - **retry** — push with `continue-on-error`, then push again on failure.
 *   Correct when they arrive together, AND only when a re-clone loses nothing:
 *   `discoverability-docs`' three write to different directories under one
 *   root with `keep_files: true`, so whichever loses simply adds its tile
 *   beside the winner's. That is **not** true in general.
 *
 * A job may have both. `feature-staging`'s `stage` does.
 *
 * ## What counts as pushing, and as retrying
 *
 * Pushing: the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` action, or a bare
 * `git push … gh-pages` in a `run:` body — every job in `feature-staging`
 * uses the latter and contends for the same ref. That became true of `stage`
 * in PR #552 and this comment still named it as the action example, which is
 * the failure mode of a doc comment about which file does what: nothing reads
 * it, so nothing catches it.
 *
 * Retrying comes in two shapes here, and both are detected STRUCTURALLY
 * rather than by a marker comment, so a retry cannot be claimed without being
 * implemented:
 *
 * - **Two `uses:` push steps plus `continue-on-error: true`** — the action
 *   form, used by `discoverability-docs`. `feature-staging`'s `stage` used it
 *   too until PR #552 (bean `bm6d`, 2026-09-20), when it moved to the loop
 *   form so the preview and its render-log entry could be ONE commit.
 * - **A shell loop around `git push`, with a rebase or re-fetch inside it** —
 *   `feature-staging`'s `cleanup` does three attempts with
 *   `git pull --rebase` between them; `stage` re-fetches `gh-pages` and
 *   rebuilds its commit on every attempt instead (issue #1868: its commit
 *   carries preview-cap removals, and a rebased removal is a stale one).
 *   Missing this shape is not hypothetical:
 *   the first version of this check flagged `cleanup` as unprotected while it
 *   was sitting next to a working retry loop, which is how a correct check
 *   teaches somebody to delete a correct fix.

 * ## The defect — bean `plj1`
 *
 * `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` with `keep_files` unset and no
 * `destination_dir` clones the publish branch, runs
 * `git rm -r --ignore-unmatch '*'` over ALL of it and copies `publish_dir` in.
 * `docs-site.yml` was the only one of this repository's six `gh-pages`
 * publishers in that shape, and it is the one that fires on every push to
 * `main` — so the most frequently run publisher was the only one that wiped,
 * and what it wiped was `STAGING/`.
 *
 * Measured on the real branch, 2026-09-19: three `docs(gh-pages)` commits in a
 * 25-minute window, carrying 1, 3 and 1 previews on their respective parents
 * and **zero** after.
 *
 * ## Why this is checked structurally rather than left to a comment
 *
 * Because the failure is invisible to everything else. The staging push
 * succeeds, the bot comments the URL on the PR, the check run is green, and
 * the artefact is removed minutes later by an unrelated merge — so no red run,
 * no annotation and no test would ever have reported it. The same reasoning as
 * the retry detection above: a restore cannot be CLAIMED without being
 * implemented, so what is looked for is the step that does it.
 *
 * ## What is exempt, and why each exemption is safe
 *
 * - **`keep_files: true`** — additive; it removes nothing, so there is nothing
 *   to carry. (It is also why it is not the fix for `docs-site`: it would stop
 *   the main site's own deleted pages from ever disappearing.)
 * - **a non-empty `destination_dir`** — the replace is scoped to a
 *   subdirectory, so the previews beside it are untouched. `feature-staging`
 *   writes `STAGING/<slug>` this way.
 * - **a publish branch other than the one the previews live on** — a different
 *   branch is a different site.
