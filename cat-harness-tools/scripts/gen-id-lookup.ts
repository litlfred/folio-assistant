/**
 * Build the prefix-sharded identifier lookup over a catalogue's REFERENCED
 * nodes, or check that the committed one is current.
 *
 * @module cat-harness-tools/scripts/gen-id-lookup
 * @covers catalogue — every referenced node of the catalogue must resolve through the committed shards
 *
 * The shape and the budget are in the `id-lookup` schema module; this file
 * only selects the nodes and writes the files.
 *
 * ## What is indexed
 *
 * Every catalogue node whose OWN `materialization.state` is `referenced`. A
 * materialised node is held, so the site's ordinary search finds it and it is
 * not indexed twice. A node with no upstream URL is refused rather than
 * indexed with an empty link.
 *
 * Which corpora are indexed is read off the checkout: every layer that
 * declares a directory with id `id-lookup` hosts one, written THERE, and its
 * catalogue is found through the same layer's declaration — never a literal
 * path or a name. An empty selection is refused.
 *
 * ## `--check`
 *
 * Rebuilds in memory and compares with the committed directory byte for
 * byte, in both directions: a file that differs, a file missing, and a file
 * the build would no longer write (a stale shard, which still answers lookups
 * for a node the catalogue no longer references) all fail.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat id-lookup                    # write every hosted index (one library's `id-lookup` directory today)
 *   bun run cat id-lookup:check              # fail if any is stale
 *   bun run cat id-lookup -- --source <name> # one layer's only
