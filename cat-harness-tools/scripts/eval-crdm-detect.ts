/**
 * Measure the `crdm-detect` phrase signals against real issues.
 *
 * ## What this measures, and what it does not
 *
 * `skills/process/crdm/crdm-detect.md` is prose for a model to read. It lists
 * five categories of phrasing plus an explicit "what is NOT a feature request"
 * list. This script implements the PHRASE SIGNALS mechanically, so it is a
 * LOWER BOUND on an agent that also applies judgement: low recall here means
 * the phrase list is thin; low precision is more damning, since a phrase that
 * fires on a bug report pushes a model the wrong way too.
 *
 * ## The ground truth
 *
 * `scripts/eval/crdm-detect-corpus.json` carries all 27 issues in this
 * repository — the whole population, not a sample — each labelled with a
 * one-line reason, owner-adjudicated where two annotators differed (the
 * second, blinded, via `eval-crdm-detect-blind.ts`; its labels are in
 * `crdm-detect-second-annotator.json`).
 *
 * The signals are in `src/crdm/detect-signals.ts`, with the check that they
 * still say what the skill says.
 *
 * Usage: bun run cat eval:crdm-detect [--verbose]
