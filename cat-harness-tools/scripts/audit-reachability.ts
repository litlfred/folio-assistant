/**
 * Which DECLARED EXECUTABLE ARTEFACTS can actually be reached — measured.
 *
 * A declared executable artefact that nothing can reach is indistinguishable,
 * from outside, from a decision nobody takes.
 *
 * ## What each check measures
 *
 * | family | question | fails |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `decision-unevaluable` | can this repo's own evaluator read every cell? | `--check` |
 * | `process-unreachable` | would `workflow_start` find this diagram? | `--check` |
 * | `process-ambiguous` | do two diagrams answer to one name? | `--check` |
 * | `module-test-only` | is the only thing reaching this module the thing that proves it works? | `--strict` |
 *
 * `decision-unevaluable` is not `kg-audit`'s `decision-outcomes-used`: that
 * asks whether a table LOADS and its first output column yields outcomes;
 * this asks whether the evaluator can read the cells. Whether any gateway
 * points at a decision stays that criterion's, recorded here only as a
 * measurement.
 *
 * Activity skill refs are not re-checked here: `check:workflow-refs` fails on
 * a dangling `<bootstrap.processes:skill ref>`, and `kg-audit`'s `skill-*`
 * criteria locate the same relation per node.
 *
 * ## Evaluability is asked of the EVALUATOR
 *
 * `unreadableExpressions` lives in `src/workflow/decision-table.ts` beside the
 * grammar, and this script calls it rather than re-deriving which FEEL the
 * engine accepts. Its docblock says why the probe is `0` and why a
 * comma-separated test is split before asking.
 *
 * ## Reachability for a DIAGRAM is asked of the engine's own resolver
 *
 * The denominator is every `.bpmn` any instance DECLARES; the numerator is
 * `processFiles` — the list `workflow_list` prints and `workflow_start`
 * resolves against. `processFiles` keys by file STEM and keeps the first
 * claimant (`if (!seen.has(stem))`), so a dependency's diagram whose stem
 * collides with the root's is silently dropped and cannot be started.
 *
 * A `calledElement` naming a process no file defines is NOT a finding: a
 * folio may legitimately call out to a process it does not host.
 *
 * ## For a MODULE, declaration wins
 *
 * Inference fails both ways (most unreferenced `.ts` are corpora found by
 * directory walk), so the count of modules no grep reaches is PRINTED and
 * never committed. The finding is a relation: **the only thing that reaches
 * this module is its own test.** A test proves a module works; it does not
 * make it reachable.
 *
 * A module says how it IS reached with `@entrypoint` in its own docblock:
 *
 *     @entrypoint script:merge:steward
 *     @entrypoint none — written for the merge-steward tile, not built yet (bean `xxxx`)
 *     @entrypoint spawned by scripts/foo.sh
 *
 * A `script:<name>` claim is VERIFIED against `package.json`; the free-text
 * form is recorded as the author's assertion.
 *
 * ## The record
 *
 * The sidecar holds the RELATION — which decisions are evaluable, which
 * diagrams the resolver reaches, which entry points are run — not the census.
 * It is a WORKING COPY: `cat-harness/test/results/` is gitignored and the
 * records live on the `qa-reports` branch, which `qa:publish` pushes once per
 * CI run. {@link judgeQaResult} reads the baseline — the branch with
 * `--against <ref>`; a baseline that cannot be asked is `unknown`: reported,
 * never a pass, never a failure.
 *
 * ## What fails
 *
 * `failOn` carries the BROKEN ARTEFACTS: a decision table nothing can
 * evaluate, a diagram the resolver cannot reach, two diagrams answering to
 * one name, an `@entrypoint` naming no script. They fail whether or not they
 * are new — unlike `audit:coverage`, where only a NEW finding fails.
 *
 * `failOnNew` carries entry-point orphans: standing ones do not fail, a new
 * one fails on the commit that introduces it. `--strict` makes
 * `entry-point-orphan` fail outright.
 *
 * `--check` does not write: a checker that repairs what it reports cannot be
 * falsified.
 *
 * `audit:reachability:check` is a step in `code-quality-gates.yml`, so
 * `gates.ts` derives it and `bun run cat gates` runs it. A gate's name and its
 * wiring land together; `gates.ts`'s `unrunScripts` ratchet refuses a script
 * registered but never run.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat audit:reachability                      # report, write the working copy
 *   bun run cat audit:reachability:check                # judge, write nothing
 *   bun run cat audit:reachability:check -- --against main   # ...against the qa-reports branch
 *   bun run cat audit:reachability:strict               # ...and fail on an unrun entry point
 *
 * @module scripts/audit-reachability
 * @covers processes, code

  // - `failOnNew` — an `entry-point-orphan`. A backlog of eleven, and a gate
