/**
 * Regenerate everything adding a skill stales, and REFUSE a skill that arrived
 * without its declarations — one command, because a documented list is not
 * reachable at the moment of authoring.
 *
 * It also gates in CI (the obligation is refused, not merely documented),
 * reports **dangling** manifest entries, and strips **retired** front-matter
 * keys.
 *
 * ## The chain
 *
 * The writer and check pairs are `STEPS` in this file, ending with
 * `subgraph:jsonld`: a skill's body is published as a content-addressed
 * PAYLOAD (`docs/payload/sha256/<hex>`) that its subgraph index points at, so
 * editing a body moves the hash; it is LAST because it reads the graph the
 * steps above write into. Checks downstream of a step (`slice:sqlite:check`,
 * `check:ci-invocations`) are not steps of their own.
 *
 * A step is an ARGUMENT LIST of package script names — the scripts CI runs —
 * so a step can carry a flag and every name can be asserted against
 * `package.json` ({@link missingScripts}).
 *
 * No entry joins the chain without an isolated red-then-green run of its
 * check against a known tree. `bun run cat gates` cannot derive the chain:
 * `bun test` runs some writers, so a stale artefact is repaired before its
 * check reads it, and checks run in sequence perturb each other. Even an
 * isolated run is not proof, so {@link main} verifies at runtime instead of
 * trusting the list.
 *
 * ## Order
 *
 * One pass is not a fixed point: e.g. `kg:audit` writes sidecars,
 * `uml:overview` renders them into pages, and `auto:docs:check` goes stale
 * though `auto:docs` ran earlier. Every check runs after the writes and the
 * command exits non-zero while any is red, so a stale artefact is named rather
 * than shipped.
 *
 * ## Why it shells out instead of importing
 *
 * Every step runs as the package script CI runs, so the versions cannot drift
 * from what the gate set executes, and no generator writes files on import
 * (guarded by `declared-directory-resolves.test.ts`).
 *
 * ## Third state
 *
 * Exit 2 — never 0, never 1 — when the question could not be answered: no
 * package manifests found, or a chain step that is not a registered script.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * It does not add the package-manifest entry. That is the author's assertion
 * that the file is a skill of that package, not a derivable fact.
 * `skill package manifests cover the package` fails loudly when it is missing,
 * and this script says so.
 *
 * It also does not prune a manifest entry whose file is gone. See
 * {@link dangling}.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/skill-register
 * @covers skills — the kind this gate JUDGES. It reads a skill's declarations:
 *   its manifest entry, its front matter, and whether the manifest points at
 *   anything absent. The derived `folio` reference pages and `qa` sidecars are
 *   judged by their own gates (`skills:docs:check`, `kg:audit:check`). The
 *   subject set is resolved from the instance's declarations via
 *   `kgDirectories`, never from a list written here
 * @covers cat-harness — retained, though in `cat-harness.json` the
 *   `cat-harness` kind is declared on the `schemas/` directories and this gate
 *   does not read a schema; an open question
