/**
 * A script's usage string must name the script.
 *
 * Asks one question, with no cwd model and no judgement:
 *
 * > When a file's own header says `bun run <path>` and `<path>` is this file
 * > under a shorter root, is `<path>` where this file actually is?
 *
 * "Under a shorter root" is a **path-segment suffix** test, not a basename
 * test: `pipeline/build.ts` is a suffix of
 * `cat-harness/content/pipeline/build.ts` and so names it, while
 * `src/index.ts` is not a suffix of `cat-harness/tools/index.ts` and names
 * a different file. Basename collisions are excluded structurally.
 *
 * Only SELF-references are judged: the reader is looking at the file, so the
 * only true path is the file's own. General paths in prose are
 * `check:command-paths`' (which counts unresolvable ones as folio-relative
 * rather than judging them).
 *
 * Where a `package.json` script exists for the file, the script name is
 * reported as advice but never applied (it may bake in flags). `--fix` only
 * ever writes the file's own repo-relative path.
 *
 * Tests are excluded: a test may name a non-existent path as a fixture.
 *
 * A file this module cannot read is {@link Verdict.Undetermined} and the run
 * FAILS.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/check-usage-paths.ts          # report, exit 1 on a finding
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/check-usage-paths.ts --list    # every self-reference and its verdict
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/check-usage-paths.ts --fix     # rewrite each to the file's own path
 *
 * @covers none — it audits usage strings in SOURCE comments, which are not the
 *   content of any declared graph. A `.ts` file under `skills/` is scanned
 *   because it is source, not because the `kg` graph is being judged; the graph
 *   audits are `kg:audit`. Same decision and same reason as
 *   `check-workflow-paths.ts`.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-usage-paths

 * container carrying untracked `_kg/`, `schemas/` and `scripts/` made two
 * SIBLING gates disagree with CI, which is how this was noticed at all.
 *
 * `trackedPaths` is reused rather than re-implemented, and it carries the
 * reason for `-z` on itself: a filename may contain a newline, and a line split
 * would mangle the very paths a path check reads.
