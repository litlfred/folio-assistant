/**
 * split-baseline.ts — what the cat-harness / cat-harness-tools split must not
 * change, recorded before the first file moves.
 *
 * Green gates after a move say each gate agrees with the tree it ran on, not
 * that the tree serves the same tools or resolves the same skills; that needs
 * a comparison against a baseline written down first.
 *
 * ## What it records, and what it does not
 *
 * - **`mcpTools`** — every tool `mcp:capture` mounts, with its required and
 *   optional inputs. A tool that disappears, or whose contract changes, in a
 *   change that only moved files is a defect.
 * - **`knownSkills`** — the checkout-scope skill set; a move that changes it
 *   changed resolution, not location.
 * - **`bunTest`** — the pass count, taken from CI on `main` at `sha` and
 *   entered by hand with the run it came from (local `bun test` under load
 *   times out tests CI passes).
 * - **Generator output is NOT hashed here.** The generated files are committed,
 *   so `git diff <sha> -- <generated paths>` after a regen on the move branch
 *   is the comparison.
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat split:baseline           # write split-baseline.json (keeps bunTest)
 * bun run cat split:baseline --check   # exit 1 if tools or skills differ from it
 * ```
 *
 * `--check` exits 2 when the capture reports a problem or no baseline is
 * committed: could-not-determine is never rendered as "unchanged".
 *
 * @module cat-harness-tools/scripts/split-baseline
 * @covers code
