/**
 * The processes graph → a searchable index over every executable BPMN diagram.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/gen-processes-viz
 * @covers processes, business-processes — the viewer lists both: the engine's diagrams and the descriptive ones (DAK business processes, folio blocks)
 *
 * These diagrams are executable — `workflow_start` / `workflow_next` /
 * `workflow_complete` run them, and `workflow_complete` refuses a step that is
 * not enabled — so their index is generated, not hand-kept.
 *
 * It reads them with the real parser, `loadProcessModel` (bpmn-moddle), never
 * a regex: legal markup variants (an attribute order, a wrapped line) defeat
 * one.
 *
 * ## Declared vs defaulted enforcement
 *
 * `ProcessModel.enforcement` is `"strict" | "advisory"`, never absent, because
 * `loadProcessModel` reads an undeclared policy as `strict` — right for the
 * ENGINE. For a reader, "somebody chose strict" and "nobody said" are
 * different facts, so this index reports them apart. It asks whether a policy
 * declares an **enforcement value**, not whether a policy ELEMENT is present:
 * a policy element with no `enforcement` counts as *defaulted*.
 *
 * ## What it is NOT
 *
 * Not a re-render: `render:bpmn` owns the SVGs and `render:bpmn:check` fails if
 * they are stale. Not a second store of position: workflow STATE lives in
 * committed instances under `beans/workflows/`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/gen-processes-viz.ts
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/gen-processes-viz.ts --check
