/**
 * Every QA verdict is written by an actor holding the `qa-reporting`
 * permission (declared in `skills/permissions/permissions.json`).
 *
 * A `QaReviewer.id` is often a script path or an ad-hoc agent name rather than
 * a declared actor, so three outcomes are counted apart:
 *
 * | outcome | meaning | gate |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | **permitted** | `actor` resolves and holds `qa-reporting` | pass |
 * | **forbidden** | `actor` resolves and does NOT hold it | **FAIL, always** |
 * | **unresolved** | no `actor`, or one naming no declared actor | baseline; fails on a NEW one |
 *
 * `forbidden` is never baselined. The `unresolved` baseline can only shrink:
 * an entry that stops matching is reported **stale**.
 *
 * Exception: a **"could not dispatch"** record may be written by anyone,
 * including the producer. It is identified structurally (`metrics.dispatch:
 * "unavailable"`, per `isCouldNotDispatch`), never by reviewer name.
 *
 * The gate reads the derived results tree and the declared `attestations`
 * tree (`test/attestations/`), and reports its population:
 *
 * - a `forbidden` entry fails (exit 1) wherever it was found;
 * - an ABSENT results tree is exit 2, *could not determine*, and the baseline
 *   is NOT judged — no entry is called stale over a corpus nobody looked at;
 * - zero verdict-bearing entries examined is exit 2 through `vacuityRefusal`.
 *
 * On a CONTENT root (`rootProfile`, `lib/root-gate-set.ts`), which does not
 * own the derived corpus, an absent tree with nothing forbidden exits 78
 * (`lib/not-applicable.ts`), not applicable. A harness root with the tree
 * absent still exits 2, and a `forbidden` entry still exits 1 in either.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-qa-reviewer-permission
 * @covers policies, scenarios
