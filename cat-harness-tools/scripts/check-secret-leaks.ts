/**
 * Leaked-credential scanning.
 *
 * | path a credential can reach a commit | covered? |
 * |---|---|
 * | an authored source file | **yes** — every text file under the scanned roots |
 * | a committed QA sidecar or witness (bulk, agent-authored) | **yes** |
 * | an ingested foreign corpus under `uploads/` | **yes** when committed as text |
 * | a workflow file interpolating a secret into a `run:` block | **yes** for a literal; expression injection is a separate check |
 * | a published site artefact under a docs directory | **yes** for text; generated binaries are out of scope |
 * | a git object from an earlier commit | **NO — out of scope.** History needs rotation, not deletion; this scans from here forward. |
 *
 * The detector is **prefix-anchored**: every pattern matches a credential
 * format that announces itself. Entropy scanning is not used: this corpus
 * (SHA prefixes, base64 witness payloads, `@id` URIs, hyphenated identifiers)
 * gives it a near-100 % false-positive rate.
 *
 * States: `clean`, `findings`, and **`could-not-scan`** (a root that does not
 * exist or cannot be read), never folded into `clean`.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-secret-leaks
