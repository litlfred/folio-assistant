/**
 * Every `degradation: "fallback"` has something real to fall back TO.
 *
 * A fallback may be a different tool or a different kind of participant
 * (e.g. an air-gapped actor whose API cannot be reached, where a person
 * signs instead). A `fallback` must resolve to a declared capability OR to a
 * derivable human lane.
 *
 * ## The human lane is derived, not declared
 *
 * The diagram already carries the fact executably: e.g. `Task_HumanSign` is
 * a `userTask` in `Lane_Human`, which binds `publication-manager`.
 * `fulfilmentKindsForBpmnType` maps `bpmn:UserTask` to `person` alone, so
 * the fallback role and the rule that stops the air-gapped route becoming
 * another machine route are the same fact and cannot disagree.
 *
 * ## The vacuity guard
 *
 * The run states what it examined, and refuses when the corpus is empty
 * rather than reporting a clean sweep.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat check:fallback-roles
 *   bun run cat check:fallback-roles -- --explain   # print each derivation
 *
 * @module scripts/check-fallback-roles
 * @covers scenarios

 * called it once per skill — its own comment there notices that *"the derivation reads
 * every BPMN in the corpus"* and hoists the call out of a predicate, without removing
 * the repetition.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-27 on this corpus of 74 diagrams and 23 skills carrying a
 * degradation declaration:
 *
 *     one `fallbackRoleFor` call        1745.8 ms
 *     the loop over all 23 skills      26016.8 ms
 *
 * One pass costs what a single call costs, so this is ~15x off a user-facing
 * operation rather than a micro-optimisation.
 *
 * **It is a single pass, NOT a cache**, and that is the whole reason it is shaped this
 * way. A cache over parsed models would have to answer when it goes stale — the
 * question `gitFileCommitSha` needed a HEAD key for — and worse, `loadProcessModel`
 * threads `seen` through its recursive descent to refuse a call-activity cycle
 * (`path.includes(node.calledElement)`), so a model cached under one call path and
 * returned under another could skip a refusal that is the point of the parameter.
 * 160 call sites, and `normaliseOwnExtensions` mutates the parse tree in place. One
 * pass per operation has none of that: nothing outlives the call.
 *
 * Equivalent to calling `fallbackRoleFor` per skill, not merely similar: the three
 * conditions (the node's skills, its fulfilment kinds, its `roleRef`) are independent
 * per node, so testing kinds and `roleRef` once and then attributing to each of the
 * node's skills selects the same pairs as testing the skill first.
