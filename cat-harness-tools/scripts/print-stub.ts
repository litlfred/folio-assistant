/**
 * Print this instance's artefact stub, for a workflow to capture.
 *
 * @module scripts/print-stub
 *
 * A script rather than an inline `bun -e` in a workflow: graph kinds such as
 * `folio` are registered by CORE as a load-time side effect, which an inline
 * eval never imports, and a YAML string is checked by neither `tsc` nor
 * `eslint`.
 *
 * Prints the stub and nothing else, so `STUB=$(bun run …)` captures it cleanly.
