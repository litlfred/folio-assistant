/**
 * remote-mount — lay a harness and its dependency closure down from another
 * repository at a pinned commit, lock what arrived, and check it.
 *
 * @module scripts/remote-mount
 * @graphNode none — a session-start step and a gate over declared `remoteMounts`
 * @covers none — it MAKES dependency layers readable and judges none of their
 * content; the gates that judge a layer run over it once it is mounted, and a
 * mount that claimed their coverage would let them be removed unnoticed (the
 * reasoning `state-mount.ts` records for the branch mounts).
 *
 * Schema: `schemas/kg/remote-mount.ts`.
 *
 *   bun run cat mount:remote              # plan, fetch, mount, write the lock, re-render the agent surface if it changed
 *   bun run cat mount:remote --plan       # resolve the closure and print it; write nothing
 *   bun run cat mount:remote:check        # disk against lock against declaration — no network
 *   bun run cat mount:remote --no-install # lay the bytes down without `bun install` in each mount
 *   bun run cat mount:remote --no-health  # a re-pin that moves cat-harness-tools does not regenerate the health report (lib/repin-health.ts)
 *   bun run cat mount:remote --help       # print this header; run nothing
 *   echo "<where they said yes>" | bun run cat mount:remote --seed <name>=<owner/repo>@<sha> --consent-by <who> [--whole]
 *                                          # create or re-pin a remote layer in index.config.json, WITH its consent
 *   bun run cat mount:remote --choose <harness>[:<instance>] [--directories a,b] [--tools x,y]
 *                                          # write a review's choice into overrides.<instance>, so a fresh clone replays it
 *   bun run cat mount:repin:standing [--dry-run]
 *                                          # re-pin every layer a STANDING consent covers (repin-standing.ts)
 *
 * `state:mount` runs the mount after the branch mounts, so the session-start
 * hook needs no second entry point.
 *
 * ## The closure, transitively
 *
 * A downstream names a harness, its repository and a 40-character pin. The
 * harness's declaration is read FROM THAT TREE; each name in its `needs` is
 * looked for in the same tree (a layer whose `<name>.json` agrees with its
 * own `name`), and failing that as a GITLINK at that tree — a submodule entry
 * is itself a pin. A need found in neither is `missing`, never dropped. A
 * need the downstream already holds as a local layer is `local` —
 * supplied, not mounted over.
 *
 * ## Three states, never two
 *
 * Every layer comes back `mounted`, `missing` or `could-not-determine`. A
 * fetch that failed is the third, not an empty layer; a lock that cannot be
 * read is the third, not "nothing mounted". The process exits 0 only when
 * every layer is mounted or local (or nothing is declared), 1 when any is
 * missing, 2 when any could not be determined.
 *
 * ## A changed lock re-renders the agent surface
 *
 * A newly pinned layer can bring new or renamed skills and agent-memory
 * entries, and an agent reads the GENERATED surface: `.claude/commands/`
 * (`skill:commands`) and `.claude/agent-memory/` plus the `.agents/` copies
 * (`agent-memory`). So when this run CHANGES the lock, it runs both
 * generators from the checkout root before exiting, and a generator that
 * fails fails the run. `--no-agent-surface` skips it; `--check`, `--plan` and
 * `--staging` never run it.
 *
 * The same run then publishes the new lock's LAYERS CACHE REF
 * (`refs/cat/layers/<key>` at the index's origin; `mount-from-lock.ts`
 * `publishLayers`), so the committer who changed the lock is its writer and CI
 * only fetches and verifies it. It is time only: a refusal (a mount not
 * `current`), no remote, or a push the credential cannot make is reported and
 * never changes the exit code here; the PR gate does (`layers:check`, job
 * `layers-ref` of `layer-pr-checks.yml`). `--no-layers-publish` skips it.
 *
 * ## A mount is runnable, and an install does not make it modified
 *
 * After the bytes are locked, each mounted layer that carries a
 * `package.json` gets `bun install --no-save --omit dev` (`--install-all`
 * keeps devDependencies, `--no-install` skips it). `node_modules/` is outside
 * every mount digest and the lockfile is put back byte-for-byte, so `--check`
 * still passes over an installed mount and a re-mount does not refuse it.
 * Why not a root-level workspace: `installDependencies` in
 * `mount-from-lock.ts`.
 *
 * ## Seeding writes consent
 *
 * `--seed <name>=<owner/repo>@<sha> --consent-by <who> --evidence "<…>"`
 * creates or re-pins a remote layer in `index.config.json` and writes its
 * `trust.consent` bound to that pin in the same write, so a pin and its
 * consent cannot be committed apart.
 *
 * ## Hydrated: metadata, no files
 *
 * `hydrated: true` on a mount entry (every layer it reaches) or on
 * `overrides.<instance>` (that one; `false` opts back out) lays each chosen
 * directory down as ONE file — the subgraph's `index.hydrated.jsonld`, read at
 * the pin from where the layer publishes it,
 * `<docs>/subgraph/<HARNESS>/<path>/` (`publishedSubgraphDir`), and checked
 * against `SubgraphHydratedSchema` and the IRI it must declare before it
 * lands, as `kg:materialize`'s metadata mode does. Each such directory's
 * per-directory answer is a `kind: "hydrated"` `SubgraphSource` naming this
 * Tool.
 *
 * Which directories: `directories` as for a file mount when it is given, and
 * then a named subgraph the pin does not publish is `missing`. Absent, every
 * declared in-checkout directory whose hydrated file the pin HOLDS — the
 * others are named in the detail, and a pin that holds none is `missing`,
 * never an empty "mounted". No `<name>.json` is laid down and the lock marks
 * the layer `hydrated` (`schemas/kg/remote-mount.ts` says why).
 *
 * Absent, it is NOT `mountDefaults.directories`: that list answers which
 * FILES a downstream wants, while a hydrated mount shows everything there is
 * to choose from, at the cost of one file of descriptions per subgraph.
 *
 * ## Named ids: declared, or declared FROM WITHIN
 *
 * An id in `overrides.<instance>.directories` or `mountDefaults.directories`
 * is looked up in the layer's `<name>.json` first, and — only when it is
 * not there — among the directories it declares from within one of its own
 * (`skills/skills.json` naming `voices/`), resolved at the pin by
 * `upstream-directories.ts` through cat-harness's `instanceDirectories`, so a
 * remote plan and a local one agree on what an id names. A nested id
 * mounts its own path (`skills/voices/` alone, or its published hydrated
 * file); naming it beside its parent mounts nothing twice that the digest
 * would count differently, since every digest is taken after every copy. The
 * DEFAULT list (nothing named) stays the top-level entries: each already
 * holds what is declared within it — its files, or, hydrated, its nested
 * subgraphs inline (`hasSubgraph`).
 *
 * ## Concern names
 *
 * An id that is neither, but is a concern group's code (`sdlc`, `kg`, `ui`
 * …, from `code-lists/concern-group.json`), names that concern across kinds:
 * it expands to every kind-first member the layer declares —
 * `processes/sdlc/`, `skills/sdlc/`, `schemas/sdlc/` — read from each
 * grouping kind's own declaration file at the pin (`processes.json`
 * `groups`, `skills.json` `topics`; the walk `concern-groups.ts` owns). Each
 * member is locked under the id `<directory id>/<code>`. A code no kind of
 * the layer declares is refused like any other unknown id.
 *
 * ## Tools: chosen by id, mounted runnable
 *
 * `overrides.<instance>.tools` names Tools that layer declares. Each is
 * brought RUNNABLE — its definition, its implementation and their import
 * closure — as the declared directories that closure touches, and with
 * `tools` named anywhere in an entry, that entry's layers mount those
 * directories (plus any their override names) instead of their default list.
 * A `whole` layer stays whole. A layer of ANOTHER entry the closure
 * reaches shrinks too, to the directories the closures need from it, unless
 * its own entry mounts it whole or names its `directories`: then that list
 * stands, and must already bring what the closure needs. The rules and why
 * each is so are in `tool-closure.ts`, which computes it; this file only
 * plans with it:
 *
 * - each chosen Tool's `invoke` is read from the declaring layer's
 *   published `tools` metadata (`index.hydrated.jsonld`) at the pin — the
 *   tree, else the pin's subgraph index package, exactly as a hydrated mount
 *   reads it — because the plan runs before the trust gate and must not
 *   execute a definition to learn what it runs;
 * - a Tool that cannot be brought whole (not declared, not in the metadata,
 *   an import that names nothing, a closure file in no declared directory)
 *   makes the declaring layer `missing` (`could-not-determine` when a
 *   fetch failed) and every layer of its entry unmounted with it: a
 *   half-brought Tool is never mounted.
 *
 * ## It never discards work
 *
 * A mounted directory whose bytes no longer hash to the lock is left exactly
 * as it is and reported, never re-fetched over. `--fresh` is the one explicit
 * exception, for a build that writes into its own mounts and wants them laid
 * down again: it replaces an edited mount as if it were current, still only
 * what the lock says this mount put there, never tracked bytes or a
 * directory no lock names. A path that holds anything this
 * mount did not put there — a tracked file, an unlocked directory — is refused.
