/**
 * A dashboard per declared STATE graph, at the path this layer uses for it.
 *
 * @module scripts/state-visualizer
 * @covers none — it RENDERS every declared state graph rather than judging one; a stale
 *   dashboard is a currency finding about the render, not a verdict on the graph
 *
 * ## The route is a POLICY rather than this generator's choice
 *
 * ```
 * <base>/<graph>/          the visualiser for one declared state graph
 * <base>/assets/<graph>/index.json   its data, published by gen-docs-pages.ts
 * ```
 *
 * **At the directory's own URL, with no `/dashboard` beneath it**: a
 * directory a harness kind installs (`beans/`, `todos/`, `fsh-guts/`) must
 * provide its visualiser at `<base-url>/beans` etc. (`harness-requirements`).
 * Three rules on the published URL space bind here:
 *
 * 1. **The segment is the layer's `name`, never its `stub`.** The stub
 *    (`artefactStub(decl)`, e.g. `folio-assistant`) names the published GRAPH
 *    DOCUMENT, not the layer.
 * 2. **The declared graph IS a path segment**, not elided, because a layer
 *    may declare more than one renderable graph and they would otherwise
 *    collide on one URL.
 * 3. **The root layer elides its own name**, because its `docs/` is
 *    installed by cat-harness rather than its own. This layer's site dir
 *    IS the published root, so `<site>/<graph>/` already is `<base>/<graph>/`.
 *
 * ## The segment is the declared entry's `id`
 *
 * `gen-schema-viz.ts` and `gen-library-viz.ts` instead take
 * `viewerPlacement(site, dirPath, kind)`, the handled directory's
 * **repo-relative path**. The two rules agree for a graph declared at the
 * repository root and diverge for nested ones:
 *
 * | id | declared path | here, `<base>/<id>/` | `viewerPlacement` |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | `beans`, `todos`, `interaction`, `issue-marks`, `workflows` | at the root | same | same |
 * | `qa` | `test/results/` | `<base>/qa/` | `<base>/test/results/` |
 * | `health` | `test/health/results/` | `<base>/health/` | `<base>/test/health/results/` |
 *
 * A public dashboard should not be addressed by a TEST directory, and `id` is
 * what `harness.json` declares and what an override matches on, so an
 * id-derived URL survives a directory moving. The id is read from the
 * declaration, never written here (`check:declared-paths` catches a literal).
 *
 * ## Committed, not written into `_site`
 *
 * The page is COMMITTED under the layer's site dir and gated on exact
 * content (`state:visualizer:check`), so a reviewer sees it in the diff and
 * the gate fires when somebody changes the generator and does not regenerate.
 *
 * ## It reuses the projection
 *
 * `gen-docs-pages.ts` already writes `<site>/assets/beans/index.json` and
 * `<site>/assets/todos/index.json`; this reads those rather than publishing a
 * second answer to "what does the work plan hold".
 *
 * ## No CDN, no framework, no build step
 *
 * `kg-viewer.ts` states the rule: a view of this repository's own data must be
 * reviewable offline and must not add a third party to its own trust boundary.
 * The renderer and its stylesheet are INLINED from
 * `docs/assets/{js,css}/work-plan.*`, the same bytes the docs site serves, so
 * the two surfaces cannot drift.
 *
 * It does NOT open from `file://` — the code is inlined but the data is
 * fetched, and Chromium blocks that as cross-origin. Over any HTTP root,
 * including a staging preview under `branches/<slug>/`, it works with no
 * configuration, because every path is relative to the page.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat state:visualizer
 *   bun run cat state:visualizer -- --check    # fail if a page is stale or missing
 *
 * Exit: 0 written or up to date, 1 stale under `--check`.

 *
 * So this page is NOT the work-plan shell the other dashboards are. It is a
 * Jekyll page on the default layout, which gives it three things, none of
 * them by a second implementation:
 *
 * - the site chrome — the navbar and a way back, which the standalone shell
 *   lacked (wireframe `todos` finding 5);
 * - `docs-ui.js` with `meta[name="fa-todo-src"]` (from `head_custom.html`),
 *   which mounts the todo board INTO `.fa-landing-board`. The panel is the
 *   landing page's own include, so the board is the same board, mounted the
 *   same way (wireframe finding 1: the items were not on the page);
 * - the no-JS floor, `_includes/generated/todo-listing.html` in the footer,
 *   which carries each item's body, status, who raised it and its resolved
 *   "About" link to the node it is attached to.
 *
 * The panel is OPEN here, and closed on the landing page. On the landing page
 * the owner asked for it slid away (2026-09-21) because it pushed what the
 * repository IS below the fold; on this page the items are what the page is
 * for, and a closed panel would leave finding 1 standing until a click.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, on purpose:
 *
 * - "State graphs this harness declares", the registry every other dashboard
 *   carries. The owner called it clutter on this page, and wireframe finding 3
 *   measured it at most of the first screen. The other dashboards keep it;
 *   whether they should is an open question, not this page's to settle.
 * - "Todos by the node they are attached to" (#1757). Its items were plain
 *   text — no body, no link to the node, no view or edit (owner, 2026-10-02:
 *   *"are not functional for more info or anything"*) — and everything it
 *   could show is already on this page twice: on each sticky (View / Edit)
 *   and in the floor (body and the resolved "About" link). A third listing of
 *   the same items would be the clutter this page is being cleared of.
 *
 * The `renders` declaration goes in the FRONT MATTER, the form a themed page
 * carries it in (`withRendersFrontMatter`), and the do-not-hand-edit sentence
 * stays in the body so `prunableDashboards` still recognises the page as ours.
