/**
 * check-published-refs.ts — a SHA may stage; only a version may publish.
 *
 * A published reference must be a version, never a commit SHA: a downstream
 * consumer may not be able to fetch the commit, and FHIR's `dependsOn`
 * (`packageId` + `version`) has no field a SHA belongs in. Scheme:
 * `cat-harness/docs/proposals/instance-versioning.md`.
 *
 * | | what it is | example | in scope? |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | **reference** | a consumer must RESOLVE it to obtain another artefact | a dependency's `ref`, an asset's `source` | **yes** |
 * | **provenance** | a record of where THIS artefact came from | `staging.sha`, `sourceCommitSha` | no |
 *
 * Classification is by KEY, declared in {@link PROVENANCE_KEYS}, never by the
 * look of the value (a 40-hex regex would fail the build stamp). A new
 * provenance key is a deliberate addition to that list.
 *
 * Per-PR previews are branches/: a SHA there is correct, and this gate does not
 * look at `/branches/`.
 *
 * Every reference carrier prints its count, even nought, with a note on why
 * it is empty; zero references is reported, never rendered as a pass.
