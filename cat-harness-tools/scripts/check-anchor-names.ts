/**
 * A name that claims an anchor must land on it.
 *
 * The rule is definitional, so it has no false positives:
 *
 * > **`REPO_ROOT`, `REPO`, `repoRoot` must land on the repository root.
 * > `INSTANCE_ROOT`, `instanceRoot` must land on a directory carrying its own
 * > `harness.json`. `PLATFORM`, `platformRoot` and `platformDir` name neither
 * > and are refused** — rename to whichever is meant.
 *
 * The repository root is found by walking up to `.git`, and an instance by its
 * `harness.json`, so neither anchor is a literal this check could get wrong.
 *
 * It does NOT judge whether a hand-rolled ascent (`"../.."`) has the right
 * depth or is used correctly downstream; no signal for that was free of false
 * positives. Trustworthy names are the precondition for such a check.
 *
 * Exit: 0 clean, 1 a mismatched or ambiguous name (or no file read), 2 could
 * not check.

 * `dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))` and its CJS twin `dirname(__filename)`
 * are just as common here, and an ascent written either way was not an ascent as
 * far as this check could tell. Measured on `main` at `e6404bc80de`, where the
 * check reported **429** ascents and *"✓ every name that claims an anchor lands
 * on it"*: extending the base takes it to **504**, so **75** ascents were invisible,
 * and **9** of those were FINDINGS — `REPO_ROOT`/`REPO` landing on `cat-harness/`,
 * which is an INSTANCE root. (A first pass here said 25 rather than 75. That count
 * came from a probe over only the files declaring an anchor-NAMED const, while the
 * check reads all 1465 and matches every name — the narrower population was the
 * measurement's, not the defect's.)
 *
 * All nine were name-wrong rather than depth-wrong, so all nine are pure renames;
 * `gen-docs-pages.ts` proved it by calling `repoRootFor(REPO_ROOT)` on its own
 * anchor, which only makes sense if its author knew the value was an instance root.
 *
 * **This is the check's own defect class turned on itself.** An ENUMERATION that
 * has to be edited when a new spelling appears is one that will be wrong — the
 * `6tkl` argument, applied to the matcher instead of to the corpus. Unlike a
 * corpus there is no filesystem to ask: a base is a syntactic form, so the list
 * stays a list. What replaces the missing guarantee is a test PER SPELLING in
 * `anchor-names.test.ts`, so adding a form to this alternation without adding its
 * case is what fails, rather than a silent ✓ two months later.
