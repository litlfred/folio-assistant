/**
 * check-code-accounting.ts — the two questions about a code file, kept APART.
 *
 * A QA axis reports these SEPARATELY, never as one number:
 *
 * | | question | kind of property |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | **1** | is this file in a directory some instance DECLARES? | filesystem |
 * | **2** | is it reachable from a Tool node, and so from a process step? | graph |
 *
 * They fail independently and are fixed by different work: a file can sit in
 * a declared directory and be reachable from nothing, or be reachable from a
 * Tool in a directory no instance names. One percentage would be true of
 * neither, and a rise in one could hide a fall in the other.
 *
 * ## Question 1 has two readings
 *
 * *In a directory declared as `code`* is narrower than *in any declared
 * directory*. `cat-harness/schemas/` is declared as `schemas`, which is
 * correct for schema modules. So the question that matters is **accounted
 * for**, and `code` is one of several kinds that account for a file. Both
 * readings are printed, and must not be compared as one metric.
 *
 * ## Question 2 is a CLOSURE, not a count of entry points
 *
 * A Tool binds an entry point; everything that entry point imports rides
 * along. So the closure is walked — `import`/`export … from` over relative
 * specifiers — and the entry-point count is printed BESIDE it.
 *
 * The closure is a floor: a module reached by a bare specifier, a dynamic
 * `import()` or a path built at runtime is counted unreachable, which
 * under-claims rather than over-claims.
 *
 * ADVISORY. It reports; it does not fail.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-code-accounting
 * @covers code
