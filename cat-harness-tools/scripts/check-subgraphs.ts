/**
 * Do the declared directories' subgraphs have any edge between them?
 *
 * A **subgraph** is a set of nodes with the graph's edges between them; every
 * set of files induces one. A **directory** is where a named subgraph is
 * written down so tooling can find it (`subgraphTree` and `owningDirectory`
 * in `schemas/kg/cat-harness.ts` are pure path containment, derived from the
 * declared paths).
 *
 * The intent measured here:
 *
 * > **The partition by declared directory should have no edge crossing it** —
 * > equivalently, it should COARSEN the graph's partition into connected
 * > components. Each declared subgraph is then a union of components, and
 * > "should be disconnected" means mutually disconnected.
 *
 * `byPair` below computes the crossing edges per pair of subgraphs.
 *
 * It REPORTS the entanglement and does not gate on it. `--check` exits
 * non-zero ONLY when a subgraph's edges could not be read at all.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat subgraphs            # the tree and the entanglement report
 *   bun run cat check:subgraphs      # same, non-zero only if something is unreadable
 *
 * @covers cat-harness
