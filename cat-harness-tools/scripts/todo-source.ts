 * `cat/cat-harness/todos`.
 *
 * So every generator that PUBLISHES todos — the JSON index, the JSON-LD graph,
 * the per-todo pages, the no-JS listing — reads them through
 * {@link publishedTodoFiles} and nothing else. When the branch becomes the
 * source, the body of that function is the one line that changes.
 *
 * Not a second reader: it delegates to `readTodoFiles`, which owns parsing and
 * validation. This module owns only the SOURCE.
