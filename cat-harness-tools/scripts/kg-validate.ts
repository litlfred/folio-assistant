 * Validate a node in the graph — **one Tool, parameterised by graph typology**.
 *
 * Give it a path, and it works out what the file *is* from the declaration —
 * which declared directory contains it, and therefore which graph typology —
 * then runs that kind's validator.
 *
 * ## What it refuses to call valid
 *
 * A kind with no declared validator yields **could not determine**, and this
 * exits non-zero on it by default rather than printing a tick: many kinds,
 * including `qa`, have none, so "nothing to run" is not "fine". `--lenient`
 * downgrades it to a warning for a caller that knowingly wants partial
 * coverage.

/**
 * The declared layer that OWNS a path: the deepest layer root in the

 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `kg:validate` resolved every path against ONE root — its own layer,
 * `cat-harness/` — so a file inside a NESTED layer was refused rather than
 * validated. Measured on `main` `cf3e624`:
 *
 * ```
 * kg:validate smart-dak/test/results/kg-qa/scenarios/kg.kg-qa.json
 *   ? … could not determine: no declared directory owns this path
 * ```
 *
 * `smart-dak.json` declares `test/results/` as `qa` — one kind — so the
 * failing branch was "no directory owns it": the resolver never read that
 * layer's declaration at all. ~150 committed sidecars across 13 layers
 * sat in that gap, which is why `kg:audit:all:check` could prove them current
 * but nothing could prove they PARSE for a consumer.
 *
 * ## Why the deepest, not the first
 *
 * Layers nest inside the checkout, and the layer declared AT the
 * checkout root contains every other one. Answering with the outer one would
 * resolve a nested layer's path against the root's declaration — the same
 * refusal, one level up. Longest-prefix is the rule `kindForPath` already
 * applies to directories, for the same reason.
