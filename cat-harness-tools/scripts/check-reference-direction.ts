/**
 * Nothing names a layer that depends on it: if sub1 depends (directly or
 * through a chain) on stub0, no reference or context points stub0 → sub1.
 *
 * The rule is `schemas/kg/reference-direction.ts`; the direction is
 * `schemas/kg/layer-direction.ts`, the same computation `check:partition`
 * uses. What is here is discovery, this layer's exemptions, and the
 * report.
 *
 * ## The repository-name collision ({@link collisionOf})
 *
 * The root layer's name is also the repository's name. Each occurrence is
 * classified by its shape (inside a URL, after an owner, before a path segment
 * into a directory the root DECLARES): `names-repository` for the repository
 * case, `undetermined` for the ambiguous residue. A file cannot exempt itself
 * by what it says about itself; like {@link GENERATOR_WRITTEN}, the decision
 * reads declarations, so a newly declared directory needs no edit here.
 *
 * ## The committed sidecar
 *
 * `cat-harness/test/results/reference-direction.qa-results.json` holds the
 * axis's answer in the `qa-results/v1` shape:
 *
 *  - **Verdict** counts (wrong-direction, exempt, `names-repository`,
 *    undetermined) are RECORDED, in {@link CENSUS_FAMILY}.
 *  - **File** counts (skipped, generator output, walked) are a census:
 *    printed, never recorded.
 *
 * The `wrong-direction` family records ONE entry per file and per layer
 * above it that the file names. It is in `failOnNew`, so `--check` is a
 * one-way ratchet: a pair the baseline does not hold fails, a pair that
 * disappears is resolved. The fix is to reword in place.
 *
 * ## `--check`
 *
 * Fails only on a graded **state** that is NEW against the baseline: a new
 * wrong-direction pair, an entry that no longer qualifies, a layer that
 * declares no `needs`. It never grades the verdict counts
 * ({@link comparableDirection} enforces this) and does not fail on the
 * backlog; the `✗` lines still print. The baseline is the `qa-reports` entry
 * `--against` names (CI passes `--against main`); without one the comparison
 * is UNKNOWN and not gated, so commit the regenerated sidecar in the same
 * change. `--check` never writes; the plain run is the writer.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/check-reference-direction.ts            # summary, and WRITE the sidecar
 *   … --findings           # every wrong-direction occurrence
 *   … --undetermined       # what it declined to judge, and why
 *   … --check              # do NOT write; fail ONLY on a graded state NEW against the baseline
 *   … --check --against R  # ...the baseline read from the qa-reports branch (`main`, `<sha>`, `pr/<n>`)
 *   … --strict             # exit 1 on any wrong-direction occurrence
 *
 * @module scripts/check-reference-direction
 * @covers computed — the set it reads is DERIVED from the declarations on the
 *   run in front of you: every declared directory whose graph typology is neither
 *   `state` nor `derived`, plus every file that has not declared itself
 *   generator output. Writing today's answer as a literal list of kinds would
 *   be the snapshot that goes stale silently, which is the failure this file
 *   already refuses for `GENERATOR_WRITTEN` and for every count in its own

 * Kinds of graph whose contents a PROCESS writes.
 *
 * This is the generated-file question answered from the DECLARATION rather

 * accepts. `holds` is already on every graph typology and already means exactly
 * this: `content` is produced by authors, `context` is read and never
 * written, `state` is written by a running process as it runs, `derived` is
 * computed from something else.
 *
 * A name in machine output is not an authored reference. The rule is
 * `qa-checkers-dak.ts`'s, which this cannot import across the layer boundary
 * (`cat-harness` is depended on BY core, so importing core here would be the
 * very defect this file reports): *"A finding on a generated file is
 * unactionable — the fix is in the spreadsheet row or in the generator, and a
 * `fail` recorded against the artefact points at neither."*
 *
 * Its caution applies too — *"only an explicit marker counts. Inferring
 * 'generated' from a path or a naming convention would silently exempt
 * authored content"* — and a declaration is a stronger warrant than a marker,
 * not a weaker one: the layer SAYS what a process does with the directory,
 * and `check:graph-typology-work` already gates that it said something.
 *
 * Asked through `isStateGraph`/`isDerivedGraph` rather than by reading
 * `holds` directly, because those two are deliberately NOT each other's
 * negations and both are false for a kind the registry does not know. An
 * unregistered kind has said nothing, so the file is READ — the conservative
 * direction, since the cost of reading an excluded file is a finding somebody
 * dismisses, while the cost of excluding a read one is a leak nobody sees.
 *
 * A DIRECTORY is not the only unit this is declared at, and taking it as the
 * only one cost 429 false findings on the first run (2026-09-23): three
 * projections under `docs/` — `assets/{schemas,beans,voices}/index.json` —
 * are written by generators while sitting in a `content` graph, because the

 *
 * It read `writtenBy` until main removed that form (#1168 B6b, beans `dv8v`,
 * `d4lb`): the registry is a `@general` node, and naming each family's writer
 * named its dependents. `generated: true` says the same fact without the edge.
 * It is also STRICTER than what it replaced: `writtenBy` could name a

/**
 * Does the file SAY a generator wrote it, in its own first lines?

 *    `docs/_data/harness.json` all along, and `glossary-page.ts` into the
 *    SKOS assets and the extracted glossary schemes (bean `ws99`);
 *  - a `generated:` front-matter key in Markdown — `gen-skill-docs.ts` and
 *    `gen-schema-docs.ts` into the `docs/reference/**` mirrors (#1222),
 *    `gen-uml-overview.ts` into `docs/uml/`, and `glossary-page.ts` and
 *    `gen-docs-pages.ts` into their own pages (`ws99`).
 *
 * No count of either: the summary line prints how many files take this route
 * on the run in front of you, and a number written down here is a claim about
 * a corpus that changes whenever a generator gains a page. This paragraph
 * carried two such numbers and both were stale within four days.
 *
 * The mirrors are the clearest case for reading a declaration rather than a
 * path: each is a COPY of a skill that sits one directory away, so a finding
 * on one is the same finding twice and its fix is in neither — it is in the
 * source skill. AGENTS.md has forbidden hand-editing them since before this
 * check existed; the files simply never said so themselves.
 *
 * Front matter only, and only the first lines: a page that DISCUSSES
 * generation must not be able to exempt itself by mentioning the word.
 *
 * JSON is read the way {@link isGeneratorWritten} reads it — PARSED, and
 * `_generated` taken from the top level wherever it sits. It was a regex
 * anchored to the first key until bean `ws99`, which is a different rule than
 * the one this docblock states: it made POSITION part of the contract, so a
 * file whose first key is `$schema` or `@context` could not declare itself
 * without moving the key that says what it IS. Both are worth keeping first —
 * `$schema` because every validator looks for it there, `@context` because a
 * JSON-LD reader does — so the position requirement cost the declaration
 * rather than buying anything. The principle the regex was defending is
 * unchanged and is met better by parsing, in the words of this file's own
 * {@link isGeneratorWritten}: *"Parsing and reading the top level is the
 * difference between what a file IS and what it mentions."* A `_generated`
 * nested inside a projection of another file is still not this file's
 * declaration, and a whole-text scan would have read it as one.
 *
 * Markdown keeps the head-only front-matter route unchanged: there is no
 * top level to read in prose, so the first lines are the only place a page
 * can speak about itself rather than about its subject.

 * X4, WIDENED — a definition POINTING AT its implementation, which nothing
 * runs (owner, 2026-10-14, Q6 of the folio-assistant#2529
 * reference-direction review: "(a)", widen X4).
 *
 * Ruling (ii) above excused one shape of the split: a harness Markdown line
 * naming the tools SCRIPT an agent should run. The same split also shows up
 * as a pointer that is not a script and not in Markdown — a skill naming the
 * `src/` module that implements what it defines, a schema's comment naming the
 * tools file that writes the shape it declares, a requirement or an actor's
 * `description` naming the code it describes. The owner ruled those the same
 * kind of thing: the definition is complete without them, and the line tells
 * a reader where the implementation lives. Nothing loads, imports or executes
 * it, which is the whole difference between a pointer and a dependency.
 *
 * Narrow on the same axes as X4, and each edge is held by a test:
 *
 *  - **from / to** — a file under `cat-harness/` naming `cat-harness-tools`,
 *    and no other pair. The "definitions there, implementations here" split
 *    is between exactly these two layers.
 *  - **what counts as a pointer** — a path INTO the tools layer's code
 *    (`cat-harness-tools/<dir>/…`, at least one directory deep, never its
 *    `test/` material and never a root file such as its `package.json`); the
 *    layer named beside a code file (`cat-harness-tools \`x.ts\``, or
 *    `\`x.ts\` (cat-harness-tools)`); and, in Markdown only, a parenthetical
 *    that wraps onto the next line straight after the layer's name. The layer
 *    named AS SUCH — in a list of repositories, as a subject doing something —
 *    is not a pointer and stays read.
 *  - **never executed** — the mention may not be the argument of a command
 *    (`run`, `test`, `python3`, `bash`, `node`, …) or of an import (`from "…"`,
 *    `import("…")`, `require("…")`), and may not be glued to a longer path
 *    (`/abs/…/cat-harness-tools/…`, `../cat-harness-tools/…`), which is what a
 *    command line or a loader resolves. Per file type, the line must be one
 *    nothing runs: in TypeScript a COMMENT line (and not a `/// <reference>`
 *    or an `import()` type); in JSON a PROSE field (`description`,
 *    `requirement`, `rationale`, a `_comment`, …) or a bare array element that
 *    is a sentence; Markdown is prose throughout, with the command and import
 *    refusals above.
 *  - **line** — EVERY mention on the line must be one of these, as in X4: a
 *    pointer does not excuse a real reference beside it.
 *
 * Three entries, one per file type, because a line rule cannot see the file
 * type and each type has a different answer to "which lines does nothing
 * run". Each is counted under its own reason, so how much each carve does is
 * visible in the summary.

/**
 * Known wrong-direction references awaiting the owner's ruling.
 *
 * `iwtn`'s `PENDING`, generalised: a leak nobody has ruled on yet is made
 * VISIBLE rather than silent. Every entry is a FILE, with the number of
 * distinct layers it names, and it earns its place by ONE property —
 * **it names more than one layer above it, so "move it up" has no single
 * destination.**
 *
 * That is the whole membership rule, and it is mechanical: `names > 1`. It
 * is checked, not asserted — an entry whose file has dropped to one target
 * is reported stale, the same as one with no findings left.
 *
 * ## Why these are pending rather than exempt
 *
 * The owner ruled on 2026-09-24 that naming is naming: a lower layer may
 * not name a higher one, and the fix is to move the file up. For the 117
 * files that name exactly one layer that is a well-defined instruction.
 * For these 50 it is not, and the reasons differ by kind:
 *
 *  - **Declarations and registries** — `cat-harness.json` names
 *    `folio-assistant-core/schemas/` BECAUSE IT DECLARES THAT DIRECTORY.
 *    Moving it up does not remove the reference; it removes the
 *    declaration. Same for `avatars.ts`, `ig-chrome.ts`, `graph-typology-
 *    registry.ts`, `namespaces.ts` — registries keyed by instance.
 *  - **Specifications about the layering** — `instance-rules.ts`,
 *    `smart-stack-layering.md` and this file. RULED since (owner, Q-B
 *    2026-10-01, X3): they left this list for {@link LAYERING_SPECIFICATIONS},
 *    an exemption, because their subject IS the instance graph.
 *  - **Prose naming two or more** — a genuine choice between destinations
 *    that nobody has made.
 *
 * Grouping them by kind here would be a judgement this list has no standing
 * to make: the owner's ruling settles the single-destination case and
 * explicitly did NOT settle this one, so the honest record is the mechanical
 * fact (`names`) plus the count, not a category somebody could mistake for a
 * decision. Issue #1219.
 *
 * **It compares as a SET.** A new multi-target file fails, and so does a
 * FIXED one — a PENDING that only grows stops meaning anything.
 *
 * That half fired on bean `ws99`, which is the first evidence it works.
 * `cat-harness/docs/fhir/ig-publisher.md` and `cat-harness/docs/process/publication-workflow.md`
 * were held here as prose naming two or three layers with no single
 * destination. They are not prose: `gen-docs-pages.ts` writes both, and once it
 * began saying so in their front matter they stopped being read at all. Their
 * entries were DELETED rather than left, because an entry recording a choice
 * nobody has to make any more is a question the owner would be asked twice.
 * Neither file was edited to earn that — the generator was.
 *
 * The second time: `cat-harness/docs/en/cat-harness/processes/index.md`,
 * held here naming four layers, is `gen-processes-viz.ts`'s, and left when
 * that generator began writing `generated:` into every page it draws
 * (folio-assistant#2529, PR 3 of the reference-direction batch).
 *
 * The third: `cat-harness/docs/en/cat-harness/methodologies/index.md`, held
 * naming three, is `gen-methodologies-viz.ts`'s, and left when that generator
 * — with `gen-tools-viz.ts` and `gen-lsi-viz.ts` — began writing `generated:`
 * (D1 aftermath, 2026-10-15). `cat-harness/docs/cat-harness/published-graphs.md`
 * left the same day: nothing in it names a layer above any more. The six
 * fhir-harness entries left on 2026-10-20: fhir-harness#118 moved its module
 * paths under `pipeline/`, and none of the six names a layer above any more.
 * Core's `figure-rebuild.md` skill left on 2026-11-02: folio-assistant-core#569
 * says "the L1 library entry" and "the FHIR layer" instead of naming them.

   * layer rooted AT the repository root collides, because only then is the
   * layer's name the repository's name.
   *
   * The three answers, in the order they are tested, and the order is the
   * substance:
   *
   *  1. **`"instance"`** — the text carries `<name>/<declared directory>`, so
   *     it points into a directory this layer actually DECLARES. Tested
   *     FIRST, so `https://…/<name>/uploads/x.pdf` is the layer rather than
   *     an address: a URL into a layer's own directory is still a
   *     reference to that layer, and putting the URL test first would have
   *     excused it. (`<name>` rather than the root's actual name, for the
   *     reason {@link Instance}'s `declaredPaths` gives: the spelled-out
   *     example would be a wrong-direction reference in this very file.)
   *  2. **`"repository"`** — the name sits inside an `http(s)` URL (an
   *     ADDRESS), or appears as `<owner>/<name>` (a repository slug), or as
   *     `<name>/` followed by any other path segment (a path in the
   *     repository, not in the layer).
   *  3. **`"unknown"`** — a bare prose mention: no path, no URL, nothing to
   *     tell the repository from the layer. Still `undetermined`, and that
   *     is the honest residue rather than a case to be eliminated.
   *
   * It reads the DECLARATION rather than a path literal, which is this
   * repository's standing rule for the generated-file question two functions
   * up and holds for the same reason: `uploads/` and `tools/` are what the
   * root declares TODAY, and a fourth directory added tomorrow is recognised
   * without an edit here.

 * "2 y" — *"re-key the baseline for the 233 moved pairs (mechanical rename,
 * no growth in substance)"*): a wrong-direction pair is keyed by its FILE, so
 * a file that moved and still says what it said reads as one pair resolved
 * and one pair NEW. The reference did not change; only the path did.
 *
 * The baseline is `qa-reports`, written by `main`, so it re-keys itself the
 * first time `main` runs after the move lands — but the change that MAKES the
 * move is judged against the baseline from before it, and every inherited pair
 * on a moved file fails it. So the comparison maps a baseline pair to the
 * file's new path, and only on EVIDENCE of a move, never on a list:
 *
 *  1. **Between layers** — the rule `rewrite-moved-paths.ts` applies (bean
 *     `70lx`): the baseline's file `<A>/<rest>` is gone, and `<B>/<rest>`
 *     exists under exactly one other layer root.
 *  2. **A visualiser page** — the page's address is DECLARED
 *     (`visualisers` in the harness's `<instance>.json`, route by
 *     `schemas/kg/visualiser-route.ts`): a page now at its localised route was,
 *     before bean `t4xb`, at its forwarding address `<harness>/<visualiser>/`
 *     or its alias `<alias>/`, the two addresses `compose-docs.ts` still
 *     forwards. The baseline's file at one of those is gone and the same page
 *     exists at the localised route.
 *
 * In both, the old path must NOT exist (a file re-created at its old home is a
 * different file) and the new one must, and there must be exactly ONE
 * candidate — an ambiguous move is not re-keyed, so it reads as resolved plus
 * new, the conservative direction for a gate. The target is never touched: a
