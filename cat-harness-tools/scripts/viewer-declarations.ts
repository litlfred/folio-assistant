/**
 * Which visualiser renders a declared directory — read from the HARNESS
 * declarations, never from the pages.
 *
 * A visualiser is declared in `<instance>.json` (`visualisers`,
 * `HarnessVisualiserSchema`), its URL is
 * `visualiserRoute({ harness, visualiser })` (`schemas/kg/visualiser-route.ts`),
 * and a page is found because the declaration says where it is — so no two
 * pages can contend for one URL.
 *
 * ## What a page still carries
 *
 * `rendered-by` — `<meta name="rendered-by">` or the front-matter scalar —
 * names the Tool that drew it. Provenance only: nothing resolves a directory
 * through it. `check:visualiser-routes` uses it to refuse a generator that
 * wrote OUTSIDE the routes its Tool is declared to render.
 *
 * ## The locale segment
 *
 * A visualiser's pages are written at
 * `<site>/<locale>/<harness>/<visualiser>/…`, and {@link pageParts} is the ONE
 * place the locale is supplied: every helper here that answers "where is this
 * page" goes through it, and so does every generator that builds its own
 * route parts.
 *
 * The address without the locale, `<harness>/<visualiser>/…`, keeps working:
 * `compose-docs.ts` writes a forwarding page there for every page under the
 * localised route ({@link forwardingParts}).
 *
 * A page committed at that unlocalised address and not yet regenerated is
 * still READ where it is ({@link existingPageDir}), so a tile keeps opening a
 * page that exists while its writer has not run.
 *
 * @module scripts/viewer-declarations
