/**
 * WHERE TO READ A DECLARED GRAPH FROM — the checkout, or its mount.
 *
 * @module scripts/graph-read
 * @covers cat-harness
 *
 * Readers of `beans/`, `todos/`, `issue-marks/` and the health results ask
 * here: **given a declared directory id, which directory do I actually
 * read.** The same call answers before and after a cutover to a branch, so no
 * reader changes at cutover.
 *
 * ## It REFUSES rather than returning a plausible empty directory
 *
 * The states come from {@link tipPresence} and {@link routePresence}, and each
 * maps onto exactly one read decision:
 *
 * | state | read from | why |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | not branch-keyed, or `commit`-keyed | the checkout | nothing moved |
 * | `route`-keyed, files still tracked | the checkout | pre-cutover: **here** is the store |
 * | `route`-keyed, cut over | **refused** | no route store is mounted, so there is no local path to give |
 * | `not-cut-over` | the checkout | the declaration points at a branch and the files are still tracked here, so **here** is the store |
 * | `mounted` | the marker's `into` | the cutover happened and the mount is the store |
 * | `unmounted` | **refused** | cut over, nothing mounted: the only honest answer is not a path |
 *
 * A reader handed `repoRoot/beans` after the cutover would get an empty
 * directory and an empty `beans list` reading as "there is no work". So
 * {@link graphReadPath} returns a REFUSAL a caller must handle, and
 * {@link mustReadGraph} throws with the remedy for callers that should stop.
 *
 * ## Resolution, and what it does not do
 *
 * The declaration is resolved through `resolveSubgraphSource`, so both the
 * `source: { kind: "branch" }` spelling and the legacy `storage` reach the
 * same answer, and a future source kind lands in the default arm. Presence is
 * read from `git ls-files` and the mount marker, never from the branch, so
 * this is **offline**.
 *
 * It resolves the directory and nothing inside it. `beans/beans.json`'s nested
 * declaration still says where `defs` is *within* the graph, and
 * `resolveBeanDefs` answers that (a nested declaration is invisible to the
 * mount).
