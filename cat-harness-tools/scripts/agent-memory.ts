/**
 * Agent memory as graph nodes, assembled into the file the harness reads.
 *
 * @module scripts/agent-memory
 * @covers memory
 *
 * `memory: project` is a Claude Code harness feature: it injects the first
 * 200 lines of `.claude/agent-memory/<agent>/MEMORY.md` into a subagent's
 * system prompt. That path is fixed by the harness; the entries are authored
 * as knowledge-graph nodes in `memory/`, so one fact can reach two agents —
 * the same relation `docs/reference/skill-instructions/` has to `memory/`.
 *
 * ## Only the generated region is written
 *
 * This writes only between `<!-- folio:memory:begin -->` and
 * `<!-- folio:memory:end -->`, as `pipeline/readme-sections.ts` writes only
 * inside its markers. Each memory file also holds sections the agent writes
 * itself (`## Session log`, and in `content-pipeline-navigator`
 * `## Corrected invocations`), which a whole-file rewrite would destroy.
 *
 * ## Telling a memory node from a skill
 *
 * Declaration over location: a file carrying `$schema: folio-memory/v1` is a
 * memory node whatever directory it is in. The declared `memory/` directory
 * holds the `memory` graph, on the `context` axis.

 * `bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/agent-memory.ts [--check] [--dir <root>]`

 * `--check` writes nothing and exits non-zero when a file is stale or when any
 * target exceeds its budget and drops entries, so CI catches an entry edited
 * in `memory/` and never assembled or an entry that blew a target's budget.
 *
 * **`no-markers` and `missing` are not failures and not passes.** A file the
 * author has not opted in is left exactly as it is and reported as such — the
 * third state this repo insists on everywhere else. Rendering "has no marked
 * region" as "up to date" would make the check green over a file it never
 * wrote, which is the shape of `docs-site.yml` failing 30 times invisibly.
