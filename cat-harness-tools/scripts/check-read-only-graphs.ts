/**
 * Does each directory's `readOnly` declaration agree with what its nodes say?
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/check-read-only-graphs
 * @covers cat-harness
 *
 * Read-only is DECLARED (listings read the declaration without scanning the
 * corpus) and this gate checks the declaration against the bytes.
 *
 * - **agrees** — declared `true` over materialized nodes, or declared `false`
 *   over none.
 * - **contradicts** — declared `true` while nothing there is materialized, or
 *   declared `false` over materialized nodes **with no stated basis**.
 * - **exception** — declared `false` over materialized nodes, WITH a
 *   `readOnlyBasis` (e.g. an ingestion drop zone that is a write target), the
 *   same way {@link GateSchema}'s `basis` is required on `permitted`.
 * - **undeclared** — the directory holds materialized nodes and says nothing.
 *   Reported, not failed; absent is not `false`.
 * - **not-applicable** — nothing to compare: silence over nothing materialized,
 *   or a read-only directory whose materialized content the instance BUILDS AT
 *   PUBLISH (a `builtAtPublish` entry lies inside it), so zero committed nodes
 *   is the declared state.
 *
 * Not checked: whether anything enforces read-only-ness at write time; that
 * is `check:materialized-fixity` (an edit that happened).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/check-read-only-graphs.ts
