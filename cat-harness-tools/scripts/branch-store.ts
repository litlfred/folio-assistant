/**
 * branch-store — a generic store for a directory whose contents live at a
 * BRANCH TIP rather than on `main`. Two keyings reach it, and they differ in
 * exactly one thing, the write:
 *
 * - `storage.keyedBy: "tip"` — ONE live copy whose tip IS the current state.
 *   Beans, todos, fsh-guts. A write carries `expect`, so two sessions editing
 *   one file is a `conflict` the caller settles.
 * - `storage.keyedBy: "route"` — one entry per published SITE ROUTE, each
 *   replaced wholesale by the single generator that owns it. Regenerable
 *   rendered pages. A write may NOT carry `expect` and is refused if it does:
 *   nobody authored either side, so the newer generation wins.
 *
 * The keying is PASSED to {@link BranchStore.open}, not read off the branch,
 * and a manifest that disagrees is `corrupt`: the caller states what it came
 * for.
 *
 * Only STATE subgraphs get a branch of their own; skills, schemas and
 * processes stay on `main`.
 *
 * ## The layout it reads and writes
 *
 * ```
 * cat/cat-harness/beans   (orphan; never merged)
 * ├── README.md
 * ├── manifest.json        state-manifest/v1, keyedBy: "tip"
 * └── beans/**             paths mirror the checkout
 * ```
 *
 * The root `manifest.json` is what makes a branch a state branch. A read of a
 * branch without one — or with a foreign `$schema`, or `keyedBy` other than
 * `tip` — is `corrupt`, never a hit: a reader must not take a stray branch's
 * files for the work plan.
 *
 * ## Four read states, and a miss is never empty-clean
 *
 * | state | meaning |
 * |---|---|
 * | hit | the branch verifies and the path is there |
 * | miss | determined absent: no branch, or no such path at the tip |
 * | corrupt | present but unusable: no/foreign manifest, a tree where a file was asked for, unparseable JSON |
 * | unknown | could not determine: the remote or git failed. **Never a pass.** |
 *
 * ## The write path
 *
 * Fetch the tip, SPLICE the changed paths into its tree (every other file is
 * carried across by id), `commit-tree -p tip`, push WITHOUT `-f`. On
 * rejection, back off (`waitFor`, the `backoff-sleep.ts` numbers) and rebuild
 * on the new tip — {@link WRITE_ATTEMPTS} attempts. The server's ref lock is
 * the concurrency primitive, so a sibling's write to another file survives.
 *
 * Two writers editing the SAME file is the case a splice alone cannot settle.
 * A change may therefore carry `expect` — the blob id its author read (or
 * `null`, "must not exist") — and when the tip disagrees the write stops as
 * `conflict` and pushes nothing. The caller re-reads and decides; the store
 * never merges content.
 *
 * `qa-store.ts` has the same loop for commit-keyed entries; it is modelled
 * on, not shared with, this module.
 *
 * ## Where its git objects live
 *
 * In a PRIVATE bare repository, `<git-common-dir>/branch-store.git` (or
 * `BRANCH_STORE_DIR`), never in the checkout's object store: a `--filter`
 * fetch turns the repository it runs in into a partial clone, and a reader
 * must not do that to a contributor's checkout. The checkout's
 * `http.*.extraheader` (CI's token) is carried in the ENVIRONMENT
 * (`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`), never in argv.
 *
 * {@link resolveTipLocation} maps a declared directory to its branch and path.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/branch-store.ts read --branch B <path>
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/branch-store.ts ls   --branch B [<dir>]
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/branch-store.ts where --id <directory-id>
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/branch-store.ts mount --id <directory-id> [--into <path>]
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/branch-store.ts push  --id <directory-id> [--message <m>]
 *
 * @module scripts/branch-store
 * @covers beans
 * @covers todos

/**
 * The git-plumbing half of a branch store, shared by every keying.
 *
 * ## Why this is one class and not two
 *
 * `qa-store.ts` (arc `3fva`, commit-keyed) and {@link BranchStore} (tip-keyed)
 * both reach a branch the same way: fetch its tip trees-only, walk and splice
 * trees by id, hydrate blobs in ONE round trip, `commit-tree`, push without
 * `-f`. Bean `2h76` part 1 is to have one copy of that, and this is it.
 *
 * Measured before extracting, method by method: `mktree` and `setPath` were
 * byte-identical across the two files but for a `private` modifier, and `must`
 * was identical outright. The rest differed only in three axes, which are
 * therefore the constructor's parameters rather than forks of the code:
 *
 *   identity      which bot authors the commit (`QA_BOT` / `STATE_BOT`)
 *   refNamespace  `refs/<ns>/…`, so concurrent readers never contend for a lock
 *   branches      ONE branch, or ordered CANDIDATES for a rename in flight
 *
 * The candidate list is the one real behavioural difference and it is a
 * superset: a single-branch caller passes `[branch]` and
 * {@link TreeStore.fetchTip} resolves it to itself. That is why the unified
 * `Tip` carries `branch` — a commit-keyed caller ignores it, a migrating one
 * needs to know which name answered.
 *
 * Plumbing is PUBLIC here, where `BranchStore` had kept its copy private. A
 * private method is right for one consumer; this module now has three —
 * `qa-store`, `BranchStore`, and `9c7h`'s `fsh-guts` — and a store they cannot
 * call is one they would each re-copy, which is the duplication this removes.

 * Replace a ROUTE-keyed directory on its branch with what the checkout holds —

 *
 * ## Why `mount` + `push` could not serve this
 *
 * Measured against the real `cat/cat-harness/uml-overview`: `mountTip` returns
 * **`corrupt`** — *"is keyed by route, not tip"* — because it opens the store
 * with no `keyedBy` and defaults to `tip`. That is `verifiedTip` doing its job
 * rather than a bug to route around, and the pair is tip-shaped all the way
 * down: a marker, an `expect` taken from the mounted tip, and a refusal while
 * *"the path is still tracked on this checkout's branch"*.
 *
 * Every one of those is wrong here, and the last is exactly backwards:
 * **publish requires the checkout to hold the files.** A route is published
 * FROM the working tree, by the one generator that owns it, during the whole
 * period before the files come off `main` — and that period ends with a
 * deletion only a person may authorise. Owner's choice, 2026-10-04, of three
 * shapes put to them.
 *
 * ## Wholesale, which `write` on its own is not
 *
 * `write` is a SPLICE: *"every path not named is carried across untouched."*
 * Right for a tip store, wrong for a route, whose contract is *"one entry per
 * published site route, each replaced wholesale by the single generator that
 * owns it"*. A generator that stops emitting a page must stop publishing it, so
 * this computes `content: null` for every path on the tip that the checkout no
 * longer holds. Omit that half and an orphaned page is served forever, which is
 * the one defect nobody would see — the page still renders.
 *
 * Unchanged files are left out of the push entirely, so `unchanged` is a
 * reachable state rather than a push of identical bytes every run.
 *
 * ## What it refuses, and never papers over
 *
 * - a directory that is not `route`-keyed — by keying, naming both
 * - a branch that does not exist: seeding carries the manifest and is a steward
 *   act, so no writer creates one
 * - a tip it cannot read, or whose manifest disagrees — `corrupt` and `unknown`
 *   are returned as themselves, never folded into "nothing to publish"
 *
 * `expect` is never sent. {@link BranchStore.write} would refuse it, and the
 * reason is the point: an `expect` here would mean the caller thinks the page
 * has two writers.
