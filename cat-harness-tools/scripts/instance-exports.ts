/**
 * One knowledge-graph export per declared layer, so each harness can be
 * fetched on its own.
 *
 * @module scripts/instance-exports
 * @covers cat-harness
 *
 * ## The set is DERIVED from the declarations, never listed
 *
 * The workflows run THIS script, which asks {@link instanceRootsIn}, so a new
 * declaration is published with no workflow edit.
 *
 * ## Published elsewhere — the only list, and each entry is CHECKED
 *
 * {@link PUBLISHED_ELSEWHERE} names the layers that keep their own
 * publisher, each with the command that publishes it, and
 * `check:published-instance-exports` fails when a workflow that runs this
 * script does not also run that command.
 *
 * Each document lands at `<out-dir>/<name>/<stub>.jsonld`, which is the
 * `docPath` `exportIdentity` gives a foreign layer, with the `.json` alias
 * beside it because Pages serves `.jsonld` as octet-stream. The `<name>/`
 * segment is cat-harness's one URL-space resolver (`schemas/kg/url-space.ts`),
 * through {@link instanceSitePath}: the segment is the layer's NAME, never
 * its stub. A layer declaring `"enabled": false` is not published.
 *
 * Beside it, `<out-dir>/<name>/schema/`: the layer's own skill I/O
 * contracts, its public Zod schemas under `zod/<module>/<Export>.schema.json`
 * (every exported Zod `*Schema` const), and a `<stub>.schema.json` index. A
 * Zod module that fails to import or render fails the run, as a failed export
 * does. Policy: `instance-publication` §"The schema".
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/instance-exports.ts --out-dir ./_site [--base-url URL]
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/instance-exports.ts --list
