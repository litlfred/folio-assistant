/**
 * Build a layer's own site from its checkout, check it, and (optionally)
 * publish it: the root site, or a branch preview at `branches/<branch>/`.
 *
 * @module cat-harness-tools/scripts/build-instance-site
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-10: publishing is agent-run, never a GitHub Actions workflow,
 * and staging previews are agent-run too (bean `n3h9`). Until now the recipe
 * lived only as prose in a Routine's prompt (a downstream's publish Routine), so
 * every runner re-typed it and each copy could drift. This is that recipe as
 * one command, the same for an agent, a person or a Routine:
 *
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/build-instance-site.ts --root <checkout> --instance <name>
 *
 * reads the steps from the layer's `index.config.json` entry `site.build` ({@link recipeFromConfig};
 * a legacy `<name>.config.json` only as a reported fallback, bean `ymvt`).
 * Any step flag below replaces it whole (no merging of flags and recipe):
 *
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/build-instance-site.ts --root <checkout> \
 *     --instance <name> --home <page.md> \
 *     --pre <package script> --source-step <package script> --site-step <package script> \
 *     [--staging <branch>] [--publish --remote <git url>]
 *
 * Steps, each a stop on failure (never a skip):
 *
 *  1. mount the closure `index.config.json` pins (`remote-mount.ts`), unless `--no-mount`.
 *     A build writes into its mounts (the harness's `_data/harness.json`, `node_modules`), and
 *     remote-mount rightly refuses to overwrite a mount that no longer hashes to its lock. So
 *     `--fresh` has the mount script replace the mounts the build wrote into (`remote-mount.ts
 *     --fresh`); with `--no-mount` it removes exactly the paths the lock names, and only paths the checkout
 *     itself does not track: an explicit choice, never a default
 *  2. `bun install --no-save` in the checkout and in every mounted layer
 *     with a package.json, so a mount still hashes to its lock and the next mount can verify it
 *  3. each `--pre` package script (`bun run <name>`), in the checkout: the layer's own gates
 *  4. landing data and the chrome: sync-docs-harness, gen-landing-data, the publish-time
 *     writers whose `builtAtPublish` output lies in the chrome ({@link chromeArtefacts}:
 *     `avatars:css`), compose-docs --shell,
 *     gen-navbar-include; `--home` becomes the site's index.md; each `--source-step` package
 *     script runs as `bun run <name> <site source>`
 *  4b. the writer of every declared visualiser page the site source does not hold yet — the
 *     checkout's own layer and every layer it needs — as its Tool declares it, pointed at
 *     the site source by the Tool's `site` input (`visualiser-writers.ts`; owner, 2026-10-15)
 *
 * `--pre`, `--source-step`, `--site-step` and `--final-step` take package SCRIPT NAMES, never commands: the
 * Tool contract admits no input that can carry a shell payload (check:tools),
 * so what runs is what the layer's own package.json says, and nothing else.
 *  5. Jekyll, as preview-site.sh does it: remote_theme dropped (codeload is not reachable
 *     everywhere), title and description from the layer's declaration, baseurl from the
 *     git remote (`/<repo>`, or `/<repo>/branches/<branch>` for a preview)
 *  6. each `--site-step` package script, as `bun run <name> <built site>`: a generator that
 *     writes finished pages AFTER the site is built (gen-node-kind-pages says so of itself).
 *     As a source step its pages would pass through Jekyll, which drops every `_`-prefixed
 *     directory: a node at `docs/_data/node-kinds` lost its page that way. Then
 *     gen-node-kind-pages, on every site, unless a site step already ran it (the schemas
 *     page links every node kind's pages; owner, 2026-11-13). Then mount-instance-docs, pdf-viewer, suggest-editor, set-html-lang, publish-id-lookup,
 *     rail-standalone-pages; then each `--final-step` package script, the same way, for a step
 *     that must see every page of the finished site, the platform's own too (an IG's one bar on
 *     the identifier lookup page; owner, 2026-10-15); then the forwarding pages; then the search
 *     scopes (`search-split.ts`: the manifest and one index per scope, so a reader never loads
 *     the whole site's index); then `.nojekyll`; then the 404 page's English fallback
 *     (`lib/locale-fallback-404.ts`)
 *  7. every relative or base-rooted href/src/action in every page resolves to a file
 *     under the site (read with an HTML parser, HTMLRewriter, not a regex)
 *  8. for the root, the guard (`site-parity.ts`): the build is measured against the root it
 *     would replace, read from the remote's publish branch (or `--parity-against <dir>`), on
 *     the pages — the theme's side bar and search, the icon row, the rail, the top-level
 *     directories, the `folio-build.json` stamp. With `--publish` a shortfall refuses; without,
 *     it is said. Owner, 2026-10-14: an IG's main site published by this path loses nothing
 *     `folio-site.yml` gave it.
 *  9. with `--publish`: the root replaces the branch but keeps `branches/`, `PC/`, `_render-log/` and
 *     every `site.build.keep` entry (an IG's `branches/`); a preview replaces only `branches/<branch>/`
 *
 * Every step runs with the build's own values in its environment ({@link siteStepEnv}:
 * `SITE_INSTANCE`, `SITE_TITLE`, `SITE_BASEURL`, `SITE_URL`, `SITE_LINK_ROOT`,
 * `SITE_WORK`, `SITE_SOURCE`, `SITE_DIR`, `SITE_REPOSITORY`, `SITE_COMMIT`, `SITE_REF`), so an IG declares `folio-site.yml`'s
 * steps as its own package scripts — the platform scripts that workflow runs,
 * with the arguments it passes — and no step is written here for one kind of site.
 *
 * What it does NOT do: decide whether to publish. `--publish` is the caller's
 * explicit act; without it the run builds and checks, and says where the site is.
 *
 * @covers none — a build step: it composes existing generators and judges no graph
