/**
 * How far is this repository from the separation point, in two parts that must
 * not be read as one number?
 *
 * **Part 1 — the declared milestones.** Every `type: milestone` bean, rolled up
 * over the closure beneath it. This is the PLAN's progress, and it is reported
 * rather than graded.
 *
 * **Part 2 — mechanical readiness.** The gates that say whether the tree is in
 * a state the repos can be seeded FROM. These are graded, and they set the exit
 * code.
 *
 * ## Why "MVP" is not the name
 *
 * The owner asked, 2026-10-03, what to call this: *"mvp = 'named release' /
 * milestone release? what do we call it in publication and software?"*. The
 * answer this repository can actually act on is that **"MVP" is declared
 * nowhere in it** — measured the same day, `cat-harness/methodologies/` (20
 * files) and `folio-assistant-core/methodologies/` (2) contain zero hits for
 * MVP, agile, scrum, kanban or sprint, against a control of 19 files matching
 * `decision|provenance`. The declared methodology set is decision-analysis and
 * provenance; work sequencing is declared as BPMN plus CRDM.
 *
 * `milestone` IS declared — it is a `type` in the bean store, it is a root in
 * `check-bean-parents`, and three beans carry it. So the report is named after
 * the object the repository has, not after a term it would have to import. In
 * publication the neighbouring pair is *edition* / *version of record*; neither
 * is a work-plan rollup, which is why neither is used here.
 *
 * ## The two parts answer different questions, and averaging them would lie
 *
 * A milestone share is bean-weighted and says how much of a GOAL is done. A
 * readiness gate is a precondition: `0 authored conflicts` is not 40 % done
 * when there are 40 of them. Combining them into one percentage — which is
 * what a single "MVP %" invites — would produce a figure that is neither.
 *
 * ## What the milestone shares DO NOT cover, stated in the report itself
 *
 * `orphanOpen` is open beans with no milestone above them. Measured
 * 2026-10-03: **241 of 390 open beans, under 18 of 30 epics that have no
 * milestone ancestor.** So the three GOAL shares describe well under half the
 * open work, and a reader given only those three would overestimate how much
 * of the repository they account for. Whether those epics belong under a GOAL
 * or under a milestone that does not yet exist is a scope judgement for the
 * owner, so this reports it and proposes nothing.
 *
 * @module scripts/milestone-status
 * @graphNode none — a read-only report over git, the bean store and the forge
 * @covers none — a merge-steward report: it inventories, it judges no declared graph
 *
 * ## Why a tool and not a paragraph
 *
 * The owner asked, 2026-10-03, for *"a status bar we can regularly refresh with
 * stats on how far we are from MVP = just shy of seeding repos"*. The reason
 * that cannot be a written answer is that every number in it moved within one
 * session: the authored-conflict count changed with each merge, three epics
 * were created inside a nine-hour window, and the seeding gate halved when one
 * PR landed. A paragraph would be wrong by the time it was read, and a count
 * quoted from prose is a claim rather than evidence.
 *
 * ## It COMPOSES the existing measurements — it does not take new ones
 *
 * Every gate below delegates:
 *
 * - `pathClass` from `merge-pipeline-paths.ts` decides generated vs authored,
 *   so this cannot disagree with `merge:train`, `merge:overlap` or
 *   `beans:rollover` about what "authored" means;
 * - `check:head-has-run` answers whether a head carries the runs it owes,
 *   including the three causes of an absent run — invoked as a subprocess and
 *   read by EXIT CODE, because its own contract already distinguishes
 *   could-not-ask (2) from missing-a-required-run (1);
 * - `beans:rollover --json` answers the bean-rollover gate, read from its
 *   structured summary rather than from its printed table — the first version
 *   of that gate scraped the table and matched a per-PR line instead of the
 *   summary, reporting `clear` off a plausible wrong number.
 *
 * A second reconciliation of any of these would be a second answer free to
 * disagree with the first, which `github-state-inspection` says outright and
 * this repository has paid for repeatedly.
 *
 * ## Four states per gate, and the fourth is never a pass
 *
 * | state | meaning |
 * |---|---|
 * | `clear` | the gate's value has reached its target |
 * | `blocked` | it has not, and the blocker is named |
 * | `reported` | measured on purpose but NOT graded — a rate, not a threshold |
 * | `could-not-determine` | the question could not be answered. **Never counted clear** |
 *
 * `reported` exists because two of the most informative numbers here are rates
 * rather than thresholds. "Beans created in the window" has no target: a high
 * value means scope is still arriving, which is a fact about the plan and not a
 * defect to drive to zero. Grading it would invite someone to stop writing
 * beans, which is the opposite of what it is for. The repository already draws
 * this line — `audit:coverage` reports its counts and deliberately does not
 * grade the share (bean `3yi4`).
 *
 * ## Every threshold carries its BASIS, structurally
 *
 * Each gate declares `basis`: where its target comes from. The health checks
 * made this a requirement of the shape rather than a convention, so that a
 * check cannot ship a bare number. A target with no basis is somebody's
 * preference wearing a measurement's clothes.
 *
 * ## It is NOT a committed sidecar, on purpose
 *
 * The usual rule here is that a printed verdict cannot tell "never measured"
 * from "measured clean", so results are committed. This one is the documented
 * exception: every value is a function of the OPEN PRs and the current head, so
 * a committed copy would change on every commit and every merge — bean `do70`,
 * a recorded value that moves on every commit, which makes every diff noisy and
 * every merge conflict. The audit-coverage argument does not apply either,
 * because there is no "never audited" state to protect: a gate that cannot be
 * answered reports `could-not-determine` in the run itself.
 *
 * So: printed for a person, `--json` for a dashboard that renders it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run milestone:status                  # the table
 *   bun run milestone:status -- --json        # the same, as JSON on stdout
 *   bun run milestone:status -- --window 9    # the "active" window in hours (default 9)
 *   bun run milestone:status -- --bar        # JUST the milestone bars, one line each
 *   bun run milestone:status -- --no-fetch    # skip the fetch (faster, may be stale)
 *   bun run milestone:status -- --skip gate-evidence   # omit a slow gate
 *
 * Exit 0 every gate clear · 1 at least one blocked · 2 at least one
 * could-not-determine (which outranks blocked: a sweep blind on one gate has
 * not cleared the others).
