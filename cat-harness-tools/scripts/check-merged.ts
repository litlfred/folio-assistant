/**
 * Run the gates on the COMBINED state — this branch merged with the current
 * base — before a merge. Bean `nytj`.
 *
 * ## The state that breaks is the one neither party evaluates
 *
 * A pull request's CI tests the branch merged with the base AS IT WAS WHEN THE
 * BRANCH WAS PUSHED. Anything that lands on the base afterwards is tested in
 * combination by nobody. Three times on 2026-09-23 a generated measurement
 * (`kg:detangle`, `kg:audit`) was green on the branch, green on `main`, merged
 * without a textual conflict — and was stale on the result, because each side's
 * committed measurement counted only its own edits. `git merge-tree` said
 * "clean" every time: a clean TEXT merge is not a clean STATE.
 *
 * The structural fix is the merge queue (`merge_group:` on the gating
 * workflows), which tests exactly the commit that will land. This is the half
 * an agent can run itself, before asking anyone to merge: build the merge in a
 * throwaway worktree and run the full `bun run gates` there.
 *
 * ## Three outcomes, never two
 *
 * - exit 0 — the merged tree passes every gate;
 * - exit 1 — the merge conflicts (files listed), or a gate fails on the
 *   merged tree: this branch needs the base merged in and regenerated;
 * - exit 2 — COULD NOT DETERMINE (the base could not be fetched, the worktree
 *   could not be built, or the worktree's corpus is distorted — see the
 *   `node_modules` guard below, bean `qook`). Never reported as clean.
 *
 * The working copy is never touched: the merge happens in a temporary worktree
 * that is removed on every path out, including failure.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run check:merged              # base = main
 *   bun run check:merged -- --base <branch>
 *   bun run check:merged -- --against <commit>   # a FIXED base, no fetch —
 *     for replaying a past pair, which is how this script was falsified
 *
 * @module scripts/check-merged
