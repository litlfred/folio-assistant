/**
 * ONE navbar, for a Jekyll page and for a mounted page alike.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists at all
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-21, looking at the IRIS replica's rail working: *"we should have
 * same navbar across all folios though. presented same way. need to comine
 * the two."*
 *
 * There were two. `harness-rail.ts` injected one into pages Jekyll never sees;
 * `docs-ui.css` plus `nav_footer_custom.html` styled the theme's own sidebar.
 * Across three rounds of `hw9g` they were brought to the same BEHAVIOUR — a
 * strip at rest, hover or `☰` to open, `[x]` to close, an inner scroll — by
 * being edited in parallel, twice, with every number derived separately on
 * each side and a test on each asserting its own copy.
 *
 * **That is two implementations agreeing by maintenance, and the agreement has
 * to be re-bought on every change.** This module is where it stops being
 * bought.
 *
 * ## Three regions, and the middle one is the only one that scrolls
 *
 * The owner's layout, and it is structural rather than a styling convention:
 *
 * | region | holds | scrolls |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `top` | the layer's mark (its open/close control, #1757) and the open document's index when there is one | no |
 * | `graphs` | this KG's own content — `docs/`, `library/`, every declared kind that HAS content | **yes** |
 * | `bottom` | the instantiated harnesses, expandable, each with its avatar (no home row since 2026-10-30: the header's mark, a house by default, is the home link) | no |
 *
 * *"KG libraries is a scrollable stacks between fixed top an bottom parts"*.
 * So the flex column is `0 0 auto` / `1 1 auto` + `overflow-y:auto` / `0 0
 * auto`, and the two fixed regions cannot be scrolled off. A navbar whose
 * `[x]` scrolls away is one you cannot close from the bottom of a long list.
 *
 * ## A MODEL, not a markup composer
 *
 * The caller builds `NavbarModel` and this renders it. That is what makes one
 * component possible: the rail's regions come from the mount table, the
 * sidebar's will come from Jekyll and the declaration, and neither difference
 * reaches the markup. A renderer that branched on "am I a rail or a sidebar"
 * would be the two implementations again with one import.
 *
 * ## What is NOT here, deliberately
 *
 * The harness **avatars and themes** are `603s`'s, in flight on PR #791. This
 * module takes an avatar if the model supplies one and falls back to an
 * initial otherwise; it mints none and knows no theme. When #791 lands, its
 * avatars arrive through the model and nothing here changes — which is the
 * test of whether this boundary was drawn in the right place.
 *

   * knows which of the several reasons applies. `harness-tiles` separates
   * four of them (`HarnessVisualisation.note`) and this renderer picks none
   * of them.
   *
   * ## Why text, and not `title` or `aria-disabled`
   *
   * The Jekyll sidebar reached this row first and said it with
   * `title="declared, with no published viewer"` on a `<span>`. A `<span>` is
   * not focusable, so that label has NO KEYBOARD PATH at all, and `title` on
   * a non-interactive element is not reliably announced — so the surface that
   * did say it said it to a pointer and to nothing else. This rail said
   * nothing whatever: `opacity:.55` and no words, which is state carried by
   * contrast alone. Both are `gjli`.
   *
   * Real text has neither problem and needs no ARIA to fix: it is in the
   * accessibility tree because it is content, it survives a stylesheet that
   * does not load, and it is not a second signal that can disagree with the
   * first. `aria-disabled` was the other candidate and is wrong here for a
   * plainer reason — nothing is disabled. There is no control. A `<span>`
   * marked `aria-disabled` announces a disabled widget that does not exist,
   * which is the "inert row reading as a control" failure rather than a fix
   * for it.

/**
 * THE TOOLTIP ON AN ICON-ONLY CONTROL — owner's ruling on bean `ob3m`
 * finding 1, 2026-10-01: *"show each icon's name as a tooltip on hover or
 * keyboard focus."* Option 1 of 4; always-visible captions were option 2 and
 * were NOT chosen, so the strip stays `NAV_COLLAPSED_PX` wide.
 *
 * WHICH CONTROLS. One whose name is in `aria-label` and nowhere visible — the
 * `⚙` here, the icon row on the docs site. A row with a `.fa-nav-label` is
 * NOT one: hover and keyboard focus open this rail, and the label then reads
 * beside its own mark, which is the name in the place a reader looks. A
 * tooltip there would say the same word twice, 8px apart.
 * `check-viewer-nav.ts`' `rail-tips` flag is the rule, read off the markup.
 *
 * CSS ONLY, because this rail carries no script (see `navbarCss`). The
 * pseudo-element is `position:fixed` with `top` left `auto`, so it takes its
 * STATIC position vertically — level with its own control — while `left`
 * puts it beyond the strip's right edge, which is what "not covering the
 * icon" means. Fixed is also what keeps it from being CLIPPED: `.fa-nav` is
 * `overflow:hidden`, and an `overflow` box clips a fixed descendant only when
 * it is that descendant's containing block, which nothing here is.
 *
 * ONE NAME, NOT TWO. `content: … / ""` gives the generated text an EMPTY
 * alternative, so it never enters the accessibility tree; the control's name
 * stays its `aria-label`. The first `content` is the fallback for an engine
 * that cannot parse the alt syntax and drops the second declaration.
 *
 * `docs-ui.css` paints the same tooltip on the docs site's strip under
 * `.side-bar`, in that theme's two schemes. Different selectors on purpose:
 * `navbar-css-single-source.test.ts` holds a SHARED selector to one body, and
 * these two differ in colour and in the widths they read.

 * single test, so the sentence was unbuilt on both surfaces.
 *
 * ## Only headings the page can actually be scrolled to
 *
 * A heading with no `id` is not a destination, and a fragment link to one goes
 * nowhere. So the `id` is the filter, not the heading level — that is the same
 * `pb04` rule the rest of this module follows: a dead link invites a click and
 * then reads as a broken site. It is also what makes this safe on a document
 * the harness does not control; those pages are copied verbatim and their
 * heading ids are whatever their own generator assigned.
 *
 * ## `h2` and `h3` only
 *
 * `h1` is the document's title, which the reader is already looking at, and
 * the navbar names the layer directly above. Below `h3` an index stops
 * being a way in and becomes the document again — and this region is in the
 * FIXED top, so every row it takes is a row the scrollable middle does not
 * get.
 *
 * `h3`s are nested under the `h2` they follow, which is why they carry
 * `depth`. A flat list of eleven rows where three are subsections of the first
 * is a list that lies about the document's shape.
 *
 * ## Regex rather than a DOM
 *
 * This runs over hundreds of copied files during a mount, and the alternative
 * is a parser dependency in a script whose whole job is string injection. The
 * cost is that it sees `<h2 id>` in a comment or a `<pre>`; the consequence of
 * that is one extra row in a menu, which is why it is an acceptable trade
 * here and would not be in a validator.
