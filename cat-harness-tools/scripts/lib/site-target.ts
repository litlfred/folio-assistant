/**
 * `--site <dir>`: where a visualiser writer puts its pages when it is asked to
 * write into a site being built rather than into its harness's own docs.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-15: *"a harness should combine its library/ (or whatever)
 * sites of it and all its dependencies and use the url path pattern"*. A
 * repository's own site (`build-instance-site.ts`) composes `compose-docs
 * --shell`, which carries no visualiser pages, and the harness's docs are a
 * pinned mount it must not write into. So each writer whose Tool declares a
 * `site` input (`visualiser-writers.ts`) reads it here, and writes the same
 * declared route (`<locale>/<harness>/<visualiser>/…`) under that directory.
 *
 * One reader for every writer, so the flag is spelt and parsed once.
 *
 * @module scripts/lib/site-target
