/**
 * A re-pin that moves cat-harness-tools also refreshes the checkout's own
 * health report, at the new pins.
 *
 * @module scripts/lib/repin-health
 * @graphNode none — the after-mount step `remote-mount.ts` runs when the lock's cat-harness-tools pin moved
 *
 * Owner, 2026-11-07, card "Layer health": "A. The re-pin does it".
 *
 * `check:harness-state`'s `health-result-is-from-the-current-producer` fails a
 * health report written by a checker that no longer exists, once it is older
 * than its grace period. The checker lives in cat-harness-tools, so a layer's
 * report goes stale exactly when that pin moves. No schedule refreshed a
 * layer's report (one content layer's was written by hand on seven days in
 * four weeks), so a re-pin of that layer failed on a report three days old.
 *
 * The step, after a mount whose lock moved the cat-harness-tools pin, for a
 * checkout whose OWN layers declare a `health` graph:
 *
 * 1. `state:mount`, so the report's branch is on disk;
 * 2. `bun run cat health -- --warn`, which writes the report at the new pins
 *    (`--warn`: a finding in the report is not a failure of the re-pin);
 * 3. `state:push --id <graph>` for each of the checkout's OWN health graphs,
 *    chosen by path, so a mounted layer's health graph, whose branch is in
 *    another repository, is never pushed from here.
 *
 * It never changes the mount's exit code: a refresh that fails says so and
 * names the command, and the re-pin's own CI then reports the stale report.
