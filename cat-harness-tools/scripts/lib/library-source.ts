/**
 * Where a library entry's own files live upstream, and the links to them.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-15: the "source" link of a content instance's entry
 * (`9789241511766-eng`) opened
 * `github.com/litlfred/cat-harness/blob/main/<instance>/library/…`, a 404 —
 * the entry is that instance's, and it keeps its instance directory in its own
 * repository. The viewer built every link from the HANDLER's repository
 * (cat-harness's `livesAt`) plus the path in the composed checkout, which is
 * right only for an entry of the handler itself.
 * The owner also asked, the same day, for links to the source PDF and the
 * entry's KG JSON-LD on a library assets page, a PDF opening in the PDF
 * viewer the way the IRIS instance's pages already do.
 *
 * So an entry's repository and in-repository path are asked of
 * `forgeLocation` — the one answer to "which repository holds this checkout
 * path", read from the mount lock (`index.lock.json` `repository` +
 * `upstreamRoot`) — and never composed here.
 *
 * The source PDF is linked through the site's pdf.js viewer pointed at the
 * RAW URL of the file in that repository, as the IRIS instance's page
 * generator does (its `readHere`: the raw host serves the bytes with
 * `access-control-allow-origin: *`; the build's `pdf-viewer.ts --allow`
 * admits `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/`). Nothing large is
 * copied into the site. A non-PDF source links to the raw file directly.
 *
