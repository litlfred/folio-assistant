/**
 * Where a library reference links — bean `qgjh`.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-30: a library reference links to THREE things, and a
 * reference is resolved to each only where that target exists:
 *
 * 1. `viewer` — the library viewer's page for the item's instance, opened on
 *    the item (`#<instance>/<id>`, the key the viewer honours on load and
 *    on hashchange).
 *    A SITE-relative path; the page that shows it prefixes its own root.
 * 2. `readme` — the item's generated README (`library-readmes.ts`), "like
 *    bootstrap readmes", on the repository host.
 * 3. `source` — the document's own record upstream: arXiv or DOI, from the
 *    identifier its manifest records (read as its README reads it). None is
 *    invented for an item without one.
 * 4. `entry` — the item's OWN page, `<instance page>/<id>/`, where its
 *    document is drawn and its held source opens in the view panel (owner,
 *    2026-10-16: *"how do you actually see a methodology linked"* — the
 *    listing anchor and the README showed neither). Site-relative, like
 *    `viewer`; only when that page is on disk.
 *
 * Read, never composed: the item from the library projection
 * (`assets/library/index.json`, written by `gen-library-viz.ts`), the viewer
 * page and the README from disk. A reference none of this resolves gets no
 * link at all, so it stays text rather than becoming a 404.
