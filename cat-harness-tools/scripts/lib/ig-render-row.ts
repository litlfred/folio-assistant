/**
 * The `[fhir]` row of the rail's Harnesses list: a link to the index page of

 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-31: *"if harnessed FHIR IG, then I want LHS navbar should
 * have [fhir] harness that will go to index.html of FHIR justthedocs
 * render"*.
 *
 * The row is decided from the FINISHED site, not from a declaration: the
 * render sits at `<instance>/ig/` beside an instance's own pages, at
 * `<instance>/` when it is the instance's whole site, and at the root (or
 * `ig/`) of an IG repository's own site. Whichever it is, the render writes
 * the IG's table of contents (`toc.html`) beside its `index.html`, and no
 * other page kind on these sites does. So a directory holding both is the
 * render, and an IG that is declared but not rendered gets no row: a link
 * to a page the site does not hold would be a 404 behind the row.
