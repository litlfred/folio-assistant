/**
 * The two list-valued edges a skill's front matter may carry under the
 * 2026-10-16 lane / role / skill model: `uses-methodology:` and `tested-by:`.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-16 (thread "BPMN lane, role and skill modelling",
 * implementation spec §2 and §4):
 *
 * - **`uses-methodology:`** — Skill → Methodology, the viewer thread's edge
 *   (litlfred/cat-harness#325, `schemas/process/methodology.ts`). The DEPENDENT node
 *   names the general one: the skill names the methodology, the methodology
 *   names no skill. Same direction as task → skill.
 * - **`tested-by:`** — a CONTRACT skill names its tests: repo-relative paths
 *   to test files or checks. The widened definition of Skill — *"a responsibility
 *   an Actor carries out to complete a Task: as natural-language instructions
 *   to follow, as a contract to be tested against, or both"* — is what makes a
 *   data store's or a registry's Role a real Role, and `tested-by` is how a
 *   reader tells a contract that is checked from one that is only written down.
 *
 * Both are READ WHEN PRESENT AND SHOWN AS NOTHING WHEN ABSENT. Neither key is
 * required, and an absent key is not an empty list: the reader here returns
 * `undefined` for "the skill does not say", so a consumer cannot mistake
 * silence for a declared "none".
 *
 * Spelled here as well as in cat-harness until this layer's pin of cat-harness
 * exports the field names — the same arrangement as `USES_METHODOLOGY` in
 * `check-methodology-evidence.ts` on the viewer thread's branch (#422).
 *
 * @module scripts/lib/skill-edges
