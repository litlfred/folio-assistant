/**
 * The capability registry `actor-capabilities-resolve` judges an actor's

 *
 * @module scripts/lib/actor-capabilities
 *
 * `kg-audit` reads its actors three ways: on the platform's own run the
 * checkout overlay (`checkoutActors` — every instance above adds actors), on an
 * `--instance` run the platform's registry plus every instance it needs and its
 * own (`neededActors`), and otherwise the platform's registry alone. The
 * capabilities were read from the platform's `scenarios/capabilities/` alone in
 * every case. So an actor a higher instance declares, claiming a capability
 * that same instance declares beside it, was judged against a registry that
 * could not hold the capability: the science layer's `lean-mcp` claims
 * `lean-toolchain`, which that layer's own `scenarios/capabilities/`
 * declares, and the platform's run reported it CRITICAL. The rule is the one
 * the actors already follow: resolution reads the layers the subject came from.
