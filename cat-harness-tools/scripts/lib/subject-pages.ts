/**
 * Where a knowledge-graph subject's own page is, for a generator that links
 * to it — the ⓘ panel and the call-activity links in rendered BPMN.
 *
 * @module scripts/lib/subject-pages
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-23T14:57Z: *"the info button/icons in the bpmn rendering
 * should point to those new IRIs"* (litlfred/cat-harness-tools#603). The IRI
 * is `makeIri`'s, against the document of the instance that declares the
 * subject (`publishedIdentity`), so a link and the `@id` it names cannot
 * disagree. `kg-export`'s `writeSubjectDocuments` writes the page there.
 *
 * A link is answered ONLY where a page is written: the host's document and
 * every instance `instance-exports.ts` exports that mints against this site
 * (not its own `canonicalUrl`), and — since the owner's 2026-10-29 choice
 * on litlfred/cat-harness-tools#638 (option B) — the COPY this site publishes
 * of an own-canonical instance's subjects, `owl:sameAs` the canonical IRI.
 * bootstrap's graph is still
 * bootstrap-tools' `export-graph.ts`, which mints fragments until its own
 * phase of #603, so its subjects get `undefined` and the caller keeps the
 * link it had — never a slash path nothing serves.
 *
 * ## Only where the checkout being built publishes the host's site
 *
 * The pages are written by `kg-export` in the HOST's own deploy: the
 * checkout whose root is the host or an index of its layers. A downstream
 * checkout (one whose root declares an instance of its own, the host only a
 * mount in it) builds ITS site, and nothing in that build writes a subject
 * page. Before this rule its links named the host's site anyway —
 * `<host base>/<downstream>/process/<id>/node/<id>`, which the host does not
 * publish either — so every step title in a downstream's BPMN was a 404.
 * There the answer is `undefined`, and each caller keeps the link it falls
 * back to: the processes viewer's page, a role's index row, the IG's page.
