/**
 * The KG sub-graphs DECLARED INSIDE one library entry, and where they are
 * published — bean 8pzh item 1.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-12, on where L1 extraction output lives: *"a and b"* — keep it
 * committed beside the library entry (`<entry>/l1-extraction/`) AND publish it
 * with the source — and: *"why does b not happen already? if its a part of the
 * KG it should be published."*
 *
 * It did not happen because the output was not part of the declared KG. An
 * entry's own nodes are its manifest, sections and blocks (the `library`
 * typology); a directory of other files inside it was in the repository and
 * named by no typology, so nothing published it. The fix is a declaration, not
 * a list of filenames here: an instance declares the directory inside the
 * entry, with a typology that is `within: "library"` (a content layer's
 * `l1-extraction`, say), and this module finds every such declaration. So the rule
 * the publisher follows is the owner's own — declared KG content is published —
 * and this layer never names a kind a higher layer owns.
 *
 * ## Where a file lands
 *
 * Beside the entry's manifest, at its path relative to the entry:
 * `<entry>/l1-extraction/recommendations.l1.json` is published at
 * `assets/library/jsonld/<instance>/<entry>/l1-extraction/recommendations.l1.json`.
 * That is the layout `schemas/library/library-iri.ts` reserved for exactly this — *"the
 * entry's other nodes have an obvious place to be published under the same
 * directory later"* — and it keeps the source layout, so a relative reference
 * between two files of the sub-graph still resolves on the site.
 *
 * The bytes are copied as they are. A graph document carries its own `@id`
 * (an L1 IRI, not a site path), so nothing here rewrites it; and the
 * committed file stays the single source, validated where it is written by
 * the layer that owns its vocabulary.
 *
