/**
 * A knowledge-graph SUBJECT's IRI: `<doc dir>/<kind>/<id>`, a path rather
 * than a `#fragment` of the instance document.
 *
 * @module scripts/lib/subject-iri
 *
 * The rule is owned by cat-harness `skills/kg/kg-core/kg-export.md`
 * §"Subject IRIs — a path, not a `#fragment`" (owner, 2026-10-23: *"hashes
 * not so good... why not `<instance doc>/<kind>/<id>`?"*). Migration:
 * litlfred/cat-harness-tools#603. This module is the ONE place the form is
 * written; `kg-export`'s `makeIri` and `subgraph-node`'s `subgraphIri` both
 * call it, so no generator can mint a subject IRI of its own spelling.
 *
 * | part | IRI |
 * |---|---|
 * | a subject | `<doc dir>/<kind>/<id>` |
 * | a process step | `<doc dir>/process/P/node/T` |
 * | a lane | `<doc dir>/process/P/lane/L` |
 * | a sequence flow | `<doc dir>/process/P#flow/F` — a fragment of its process's page |
 *
 * `<doc dir>` is the directory the instance document is served from, the same
 * base a Tool's `<doc dir>/tools/<id>.jsonld` uses (bean `tdir`). A flow is
 * the one `#` allowed for instance data: nothing cites an arrow on its own,
 * so it stays a place on its process's page (owner, 2026-10-23T14:56Z).
 *
 * Every subject IRI must load, so `kg-export` writes `<kind>/<id>.jsonld`
 * and `<kind>/<id>.html` beside the instance document for each one
 * (`writeSubjectDocuments`). GitHub Pages serves `<id>.html` at the
 * extensionless path, which is what makes the bare IRI dereference.
 */

/**
 * Every kind a subject IRI may carry. {@link subjectIri} refuses any other.
 *
 * Its first job is gone: the host's document sat at the site root, so the set
 * had to tell another layer's `…/<instance>/skill/x` from a kind.
 * Since 2026-10-23 every layer's document, the host's included, sits at
 * `<site>/<instance>/<stub>.jsonld` with its subjects beside it (owner: one
 * rule for every layer; subjects beside their document), so no layer
 * folder shares a subject's base.
 *
 * It stays closed for the two jobs left. {@link subjectPathOf} still has to
 * tell a subject from the other files in the same directory: the Tool
 * documents (`tools/<id>.jsonld`), the diagram vocabulary
 * (`processes/ns.jsonld`), the context and the document itself. And a kind
 * nobody declared is a typo that would mint an address no page serves, so
 * {@link subjectIri} refuses it rather than publishing it.
