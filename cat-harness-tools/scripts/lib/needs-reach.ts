/**
 * Which instances reach a given one through `needs`, named once.
 *
 * "Below the harness" means every instance that does NOT reach the harness
 * through `needs` (itself counting as reaching itself). It is the rule
 * `libraries.ts` uses for the layers whose `software-library` nodes this
 * layer holds, and the one `declarations-retag.ts` and `bpmn-checklist.ts`
 * use for the instances that must not refer to a harness.
 *
 * It replaced "everything the harness transitively needs" (bean `w1gy`), which
 * broke when cat-harness#787 dropped `bootstrap-tools` from cat-harness's
 * `needs`: bootstrap-tools still sits below the harness (it needs only
 * bootstrap), but the harness no longer named it, so it was treated as above.
 * Asking whether an instance reaches the harness does not depend on which
 * lower layers the harness happens to name.
