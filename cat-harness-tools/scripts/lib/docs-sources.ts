/**
 * Every DOCS SOURCE the checkout declares: the base instance's, then each
 * instance above it that declares one of its own.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-23 ("A1"): ONE docs-page build run that reads the
 * docs-source directory EVERY mounted instance declares — not one run per
 * instance. Until then `gen-docs-pages.ts` took its one root from
 * `HARNESS_ROOT`, so a page about a higher layer's process could only be
 * authored here, in the layer below it, which is the wrong direction.
 *
 * ## Where a docs source is declared, and where its pages land
 *
 * The same place the base instance declares its own: a `docs-source` entry
 * in the `docs.json` of a directory the instance declares with graph typology
 * `docs`. Its pages render into THAT directory (`<docs dir>/<slug>.md`),
 * exactly as the base instance's render into its site directory. So an
 * instance publishes its pages wherever that directory is published — for a
 * `composed` one, inside the one Jekyll site, under the instance's own name.
 *
 * ## Which instances, and in what order
 *
 * The base first, then the checkout's instances that DEPEND on it, deepest
 * first ({@link checkoutDependentsOf}) — the order `scenario-overlay` reads
 * higher layers' scenarios in. This file names no instance: which ones exist
 * is the checkout's answer, never a list written down here.
 *
 * ## Every key a source above the base publishes is qualified by its instance
 *
 * A page's slug is unique only WITHIN its source. Its route already carries
 * the instance (a source above the base is composed into the site under the
 * instance's name), and so does every key derived from it
 * ({@link qualifiedKey}): the page key todos attach to and the listing they
 * are grouped under, the address of its QA witnesses
 * (`/assets/qa/<instance>/<slug>/`, which the site build copies each
 * instance's witness tree into) and its block labels. The base instance's keys
 * are its own, unqualified, so what it publishes is unchanged.
 *
 * So the same page in two layers is two distinct pages with two distinct
 * IRIs, and nothing collides. Owner, 2026-10-23: that is never a failure,
 * only a warning ({@link warnSamePages}), naming both files — it is usually a
 * move in flight (the higher layer has added the page and the lower layer has
 * not removed it yet), which the warning says how to finish.
