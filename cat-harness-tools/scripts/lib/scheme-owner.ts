/**
 * Which instance owns a glossary scheme: the one rule, shared by the record and the page.
 *
 * A scheme id such as `kg-tools` is every instance's Tool extraction, so the
 * id alone names no one scheme. The owner ruled on bean `q3n9` (2026-10-24,
 * option A) that a scheme is keyed by **(instance, scheme)**, with the
 * instance taken from the scheme's source by this function. There is no
 * `instance` field in the glossary file and no rule from its path: a file
 * that moves keeps its owner, and the index and a standalone checkout agree.
 *
 * It lives here, below both of its readers, so there is one implementation:
 * `check-term-mapping.ts` (this layer) keys the term-mapping record by it, and
 * the content core's `scripts/glossary-page.ts` (a layer above) mints IRIs
 * and places terms by it. The page used to hold the only copy, which the
 * record could not import without reading upward.

 * owner, and that is an error rather than a guess: split the scheme per
