/**
 * The three roots a file in this layer means, named once.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Code that lived in `cat-harness/` computed "the harness" as
 * `import.meta.dir/..` — 460 such sites in 399 files, measured for bean `70lx`
 * (S5 stage 1a). Once that code moves here the same expression means
 * `cat-harness-tools/`, which holds no skills, processes, docs or results, and
 * nothing fails loudly: a scan over an empty directory reports a clean run (the
 * bean `dh4f` shape). So every such site is rewritten, as it moves, to ask for
 * the root it meant:
 *
 * | constant | means | is |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | {@link HARNESS_ROOT} | the harness CONTENT this layer serves — skills, processes, schemas, `test/results/` | resolved, see below |
 * | {@link TOOLS_ROOT} | this layer itself — the code that moved | `import.meta.dir/../..` |
 * | {@link REPO_ROOT} | the checkout holding both, when there is one | `undefined` standalone |
 *
 * ## How the harness is found, and why in this order
 *
 * 1. `--harness <dir>` (or `--harness=<dir>`) — the caller said so, for this run.
 * 2. `$CAT_HARNESS_ROOT` — the environment said so, for every run.
 * 3. The sibling `../cat-harness`, **only if its declaration's `name` is
 *    `cat-harness`**. A directory that merely has the right name is not the
 *    harness; the declaration is the contract, as it is everywhere else here.
 *
 * Nothing found is a THROW, not a guess. Every caller of `HARNESS_ROOT` reads
 * content from it, and a wrong root reads as an empty corpus.
 *
 * An explicit root (1 or 2) is checked the same way: it must hold a
 * `cat-harness.json` naming `cat-harness`. A typo in `$CAT_HARNESS_ROOT`
 * should fail where it is made, not three calls later as "no skills".
 *
 * ## Why this file reads the declaration itself
 *
 * It could import `readDeclaration` from the harness, but that import is a
 * relative path into the sibling — which assumes the very layout this module
 * exists to resolve. One `JSON.parse` of one field keeps the resolver free of
 * the thing it is resolving.
