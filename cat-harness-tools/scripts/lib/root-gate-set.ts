/**
 * Which gate set a root is measured against: the harness's own CI recipe, or
 * the gates the root's own CI runs.
 *
 * @module scripts/lib/root-gate-set
 * @graphNode none — a reader of one shared definition
 *
 * ## The decision
 *
 * Owner, cat-harness-tools#281: **"hold smart-ra to its own gate set."**
 * `audit:coverage` and `qa:refresh` measured every root against
 * `.github/workflows/code-quality-gates.yml` ({@link GATES_WORKFLOW}), which is
 * the HARNESS's CI recipe. A content repository (smart-ra, an IG index, a
 * layer repository) has no such file; its CI is the shared
 * `layer-pr-checks.yml`, whose gate set `run-gates.py` derives from the
 * root's own and its dependency harness's `check:*` / `*:check` scripts, plus
 * `CHECKOUT_SCRIPTS`. Reading the harness file there ended in ENOENT, and
 * zero gates read as "EXAMINED NOTHING".
 *
 * ## One definition, read here
 *
 * The derivation lives once, in `run-gates.py` (`derive`), the script the
 * workflow runs. This module asks it (`run-gates.py <root> --list`) instead
 * of restating its rules in TypeScript, so a gate added to the derivation —
 * a new `CHECKOUT_SCRIPTS` entry, a new skip rule — reaches `loadGates`,
 * `audit:coverage` and `qa:refresh` with no second list to keep in step.
 *
 * The rule is generic: a root is a HARNESS when it carries
 * {@link GATES_WORKFLOW}, and a CONTENT root otherwise. No repository is named.
