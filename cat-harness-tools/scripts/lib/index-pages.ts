/**
 * The pages `index:render` reads the presence of, built before it renders.
 *
 * @module cat-harness-tools/scripts/lib/index-pages
 *
 * The README's instance table links a declared `docs` directory only when it
 * is on disk (`pipeline/readme-sections.ts`), and an IG instance's `docs/` is
 * BUILT, by its `<instance>:pages` script, never committed. So the rendered
 * README depended on whether somebody had built the pages: the gate job, which
 * builds them, read one README; a checkout that had not, another
 * (`declared-assets > the provenance … is RENDERED`, folio-assistant#2544).
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-14: "Build pages first". `index:render` and its check build
 * the declared pages first, so the links are always computed against a built
 * tree. A docs directory counts when its declaration names a `writer` (it is
 * built, not authored) and its instance's package declares `<instance>:pages`
 * (the convention every IG instance follows); one already on disk is not
 * rebuilt, since only its presence is read.
