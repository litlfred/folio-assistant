/**
 * The harness rail — now a thin ADAPTER over the shared navbar.
 *
 * ## What moved, and why this file still exists
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-21: *"we should have same navbar across all folios though.
 * presented same way. need to comine the two."* The markup, the stylesheet and
 * the three-region layout are in `lib/navbar.ts`; what stays here is the one
 * thing that is genuinely about MOUNTED PAGES:
 *
 * > a page Jekyll never rendered gets no layout, so the harness's navigation
 * > has to be injected into somebody else's finished document.
 *
 * `mount-instance-docs.ts` does that injection and this file gives it the
 * model. Nothing about the navbar's appearance is decided here any more, which
 * is the whole point: the rail and the site sidebar stopped being two
 * implementations that agree by maintenance.
 *
 * ## Why the rail went first
 *
 * Owner's ruling on the collision, 2026-09-21: split by layer. `603s` (PR
 * #791) is mid-flight on the harness avatars and themes, and the Jekyll
 * sidebar's own include is where the two would collide — so the sidebar
 * switches to `navbar.ts` after that lands. The rail is the side with no other
 * claimant, which makes it the side where the component can be got right
 * without re-resolving against three moving branches.
 *
 * ## No JavaScript, and here it is not a preference
 *
 * These documents are copied verbatim from layers the harness does not
 * control. Injecting a nav into somebody else's page is one claim; injecting
 * script into it is a larger one.
 *
 * @module scripts/lib/harness-rail
