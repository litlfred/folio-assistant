/**
 * Where a step writes, and reads back, a file it COMPUTES for a layer: one
 * output root per layer, outside the mounts.
 *
 * @module scripts/lib/layer-output
 * @graphNode none — a path resolver every writer of a layer's computed files calls
 *
 * Owner ruling on bean `cat-tools-sm8r`, item 4 ("no CI step writes inside a
 * mount"), planned in the bean before any code. A mounted layer is
 * READ-ONLY in a checkout that mounts it: its directory holds the pinned
 * bytes and nothing else, so `mount-from-lock.sh --check` stays `current`
 * after a local gate run, and no later `state:mount` refuses an "edited"
 * mount. Measured 2026-11-06: earlier jobs' writers (the IG index, the QA
 * working copy, glossary pages, the docs) wrote into every mounted layer and
 * reddened all eight `state:mount` steps of a local run.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * - A **mounted** layer (one the checkout's `index.lock.json` lists with a
 *   mount path): its computed files go under
 *   `build/layers/<instance>/<the same instance-relative path>`.
 * - A **local** layer (the checkout's own, `source.local`): its computed
 *   files go where they always have, inside the layer. A layer building
 *   itself changes nothing.
 *
 * Reading is an OVERLAY: the output root when the file is there, else the
 * layer's own path, which for a mount is the pinned bytes.
 *
 * Nothing else may join a layer path to a computed file; the write-site
 * check that enforces that is plan step 1's second half.
