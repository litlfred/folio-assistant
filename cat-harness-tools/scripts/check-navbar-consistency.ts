/**
 * Is every harness's LHS navbar entry themed, and does one artefact wear one
 * glyph across the two surfaces that draw it?
 *
 * @module scripts/check-navbar-consistency
 * @covers none — its subjects are the `<instance>.json` DECLARATIONS and the
 * client that renders them, neither of which is a node in a declared graph.
 * `@covers themes` would name a kind it never resolves a directory of.
 *
 * A navbar entry's picture comes from one of **two unrelated namespaces**,
 * reported as separate families because the repairs differ:
 *
 * 1. A layer's own `icon` is an **id into that layer's `images` list** —
 *    `sync-docs-harness.ts` resolves it with
 *    `decl.images?.find((i) => i.id === decl.icon)`, so it ends at an SVG file.
 * 2. A directory tile's `tile.icon` is a **name in the client's glyph
 *    registry** — `glyphFor` in `docs/assets/js/docs-ui.js` looks it up in
 *    `TILE_GLYPHS` and falls back to the net when it misses.
 *
 * The fallback itself is never graded (it covers a folio naming a glyph an
 * older platform lacks). What is graded is a tile name declared in this
 * repository that this repository's registry does not draw.
 *
 * `ROW_GLYPHS` (the navbar row, in `navbar-row.js`) and `TILE_GLYPHS` (the
 * glass tile panel, in `docs-ui.js`) are separate literals; where an id
 * appears in both, they must name the same glyph constant.
 *
 * Related gates: `navbar:geometry:check` (widths, from
 * `lib/navbar-geometry.ts`) and `check:viewer-nav` (which pages carry a rail).
 * This one checks iconography only.
 *
 * If either registry literal cannot be located, this refuses rather than
 * reporting the families clean.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 report only, or `--check` with no blocking finding · 1
 * `--check` (or `--strict`) with one · 2 could not determine, which includes
 * a declaration that will not load.
