/**
 * The translation status page — what the gettext side actually covers.
 *
 * @module scripts/gen-translation-status
 * @covers translation-sources
 *
 * It is the viewer of the `translation-sources` graph (`translations/`). That
 * graph is authored input to injection, not state, so `state-visualizer.ts`
 * (which draws only `isStateGraph` kinds) skips it.
 *
 * ## What it measures, and what it refuses to guess
 *
 *   1. IS THERE A CATALOGUE AT ALL? `.pot` templates are what CAN be
 *      translated; `.po` catalogues are what somebody started. A locale with
 *      few catalogues is mostly unreachable however complete its strings are.
 *   2. OF THE CATALOGUES THAT EXIST, how much is translated, fuzzy, or empty.
 *
 * It never reports (2) without (1). Every number is DERIVED from the files on
 * each run; there is no baseline to go stale.
 *
 * ## Paths come from the DECLARATION
 *
 * The translations directory is resolved from the instance's own
 * `<instance>.json` (`translation-sources`), and the site directory from
 * `siteDirFor`. Neither is written here; `site-dir-single-answer.test.ts`
 * guards the second across the whole tree.
 *
 * ## `--instance <dir>`: another instance's catalogues, reported
 *
 * The page and projection this generator writes are THIS instance's viewer, at
 * a route this instance declares, so another instance's numbers are not
 * written there. With `--instance`, the instance at `<dir>` is measured from
 * its own `translation-sources` declaration and the per-locale table is
 * printed (or emitted as the projection's `locales` array with `--json`);
 * nothing is written, with or without `--check`. An instance that declares no
 * such directory exits 2, as this one would.

 *   the single most misleading thing this parser could do, because fuzzy
 *   entries are precisely the ones a reviewer must look at.
 * - **Plurals** put the translation in `msgstr[0]`, `msgstr[1]`, … rather than
 *   `msgstr`. A parser that only knows `msgstr` reports every plural entry as
 *   untranslated.
 * - **Continuation lines** — a long string is written as several quoted lines

<h1 id="ts-title">translations — status</h1>
<p class="ts-sub">The gettext side of the <code>translation-sources</code> graph, measured from the files in
<code>${esc(doc.scope)}</code>. Every number here is derived on each run; none is written down. Governed by the
${skill}. These
numbers last <strong>changed</strong> on ${esc(doc.changedAt)}.</p>

<div class="ts-questions-legend">
  <div><strong>Question 1 (Availability):</strong> Are there <code>.po</code> catalogues for extractable <code>.pot</code> templates?</div>
  <div><strong>Question 2 (Completeness):</strong> Of the catalogues that exist, how many strings are translated?</div>
  <div><strong>Question 3 (Officiality):</strong> Has a person signed this locale off? Read from the PO headers and <code>status.json</code>, which must agree.</div>
</div>

${localeTable(doc.locales, "", doc.scope)}
${others}

<p class="ts-note"><strong>Two questions, not one.</strong> <em>catalogues / templates</em> asks whether a
<code>.po</code> exists at all for each extractable <code>.pot</code>; the string columns ask how much of
the catalogues that DO exist is done. A locale can be near 100% translated across a handful of catalogues
while most of its templates have none — which is why the first column is not folded into the rest.</p>

<p class="ts-note"><strong>&ldquo;no basis&rdquo; is not zero.</strong> A share over an empty denominator is
undefined, and rendering it as 0% would report a measurement this run did not make.</p>

<p class="ts-note"><strong>One directory per table, each named.</strong> <code>translation-sources</code> is a graph
KIND, and more than one instance may declare it; the first table measures the directory named in the subtitle,
and each instance below it gets its own table for its own declared directory. They are never summed: two
instances' catalogues answer two questions. A catalogue sitting in an instance that has not declared the
directory is invisible here — which is a gap in that declaration rather than a locale with no work done, and
the two must not read the same.</p>

<p class="ts-note"><strong>Fuzzy is counted apart from translated.</strong> A fuzzy entry has a translation
and needs review; adding it to <em>translated</em> would flatter exactly the entries a reviewer must look at.</p>
