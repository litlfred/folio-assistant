/**
 * check-asset-roles.ts — every required asset role has decided its layer, and
 * no instance restates on an asset what the ROLE already answers.
 *
 * Two halves of one rule: `ASSET_ROLES` is the single place a role says what
 * it is for, which layer it belongs to and how it reaches its reader. This
 * gate keeps that place SINGLE.
 *
 * ## Stray keys
 *
 * `KgAssetSchema` is a non-strict `z.object` (so a downstream instance can
 * carry a key this layer does not know), which drops an unknown key without
 * a word. A key restated on an asset would vanish silently, so the RAW
 * declaration is what gets asked.
 *
 * ## Layers
 *
 * `AssetRoleDef.layer` is required, and `tsc` refuses a role that does not
 * say. This half catches the other direction: a role in
 * `REQUIRED_ASSET_ROLES` that `ASSET_ROLES` does not govern at all. The two
 * lists are separate (what every instance must declare; what a role means),
 * and only this gate makes them agree.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-asset-roles
 * @covers cat-harness — `ASSET_ROLES` against what each instance's declaration restates on an
 *   asset
