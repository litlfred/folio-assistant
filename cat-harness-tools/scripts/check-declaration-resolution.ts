/**
 * Every path a declaration NAMES resolves — directories, assets, visualisers
 * and `needs` — in the checkout being checked, whatever its layout.
 *
 * @module cat-harness-tools/scripts/check-declaration-resolution
 * @covers cat-harness — every layer declaration in the checkout
 *
 * ## Mostly composition
 *
 * Four existing gates each resolve one field; this gate CALLS them rather
 * than restating them, and resolves the rest itself:
 *
 * | field | resolved by | what it answers |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `directories` (and those declared from within) | `check:declared-dirs` → `auditInstance` | the directory is on disk, mounted, or exempt with a reason |
 * | `assets` | `check:declared-assets` → `auditInstance` | the file exists |
 * | `visualisers[].renderedBy` | `check:visualiser-routes` → `checkVisualiserRoutes` | names a discovered Tool node |
 * | `needs` | `check:instance-graph` → `resolveInstanceGraph` | every dependency resolves, no cycle |
 * | `enableSubgraphs` | here → `enableSubgraphsProblems` | each id names an opt-in sub-graph of this layer or its `needs` closure |
 * | `optInLinks` (the opt-in `directories`, as link targets) | `check:optin-links` → `checkOptInLinks` | no always-on page links into an opt-in sub-graph, which is absent wherever it is switched off |
 *
 * It also resolves `visualisers[].coversKinds`, a graph typology, which
 * `checkVisualiserRoutes` drops unjudged (it filters to PUBLISHED kinds).
 * `covers`, a directory id, is refused by the declaration schema itself; a
 * declaration that does not parse is a finding.
 *
 * The result is one run, one verdict, per layer and per field, over the
 * checkout as it is actually laid out.
 *
 * ## The checkout is `cwd`
 *
 * There is no fixed-depth repository root. Every gate composed here reads the
 * checkout from its argument, and the graph-typology registry reads kinds
 * from the checkout under inspection (`cwd`) before the one the harness
 * module sits in (`defaultTypologyRoots`, cat-harness). So `--root` re-runs
 * this script with `cwd` set to that root: a declaration whose kinds come
 * from a mounted layer is judged against that layer, standalone or mounted
 * alike.
 *
 * ## Three states, never two
 *
 * Exit 0 every reference resolves · 1 at least one does not (reported even
 * when something else was undetermined: a certain finding is never hidden) ·
 * 2 could not determine (no layer in the checkout, or a composed gate that
 * could not run). 2 is never a pass.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/check-declaration-resolution.ts [--root <checkout>] [--json]
