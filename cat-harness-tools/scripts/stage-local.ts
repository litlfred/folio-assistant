/**
 * stage-local — the ONE agent publish path: build a folio's or an IG's site in
 * the agent's own checkout and push it to the publish branch, as a preview
 * or as the main site, without an Actions runner.
 *
 * @module scripts/stage-local
 * @covers none — a PUBLISHER, not an audit: it builds and deploys one preview and judges nothing
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/stage-local.ts --repo ../<repository> [--branch B] [--plan | --dry-run | --artifact DIR]
 * ```
 *
 * ## One command, every agent-run publish (owner, 2026-10-10)
 *
 * The owner, asking on 2026-10-10 about the IG repositories then publishing
 * by hand: *"i want one consolidated worfklow."* A repository is AGENT-RUN
 * when it declares so in its own `index.config.json`, `"site": { "agentRun":
 * true }` (owner, 2026-10-14, Q7: "Yes, declare it"; {@link agentRunOf}).
 * Its publish workflows are dispatch-only, documentation of what this path
 * must match and never something an agent dispatches, and every plan says
 * whether the repository declares it. This file keeps no list of them. So:
 *
 * - **a declared site first**: a repository whose layer config (its
 *   `index.config.json` entry; a legacy `<instance>.config.json` is a reported fallback)
 *   carries `site.build` is built by `build-instance-site.ts` from its own
 *   package scripts ({@link declaredRecipe}, {@link stageDeclared});
 * - otherwise **which publisher** is read from the repository's own workflow files
 *   (`detectPublisher`, `site-publisher.ts`): a caller of `folio-staging.yml`
 *   is a folio, published here; a caller of a workflow another publisher
 *   declares is handed to THAT publisher's code. A publisher other than the
 *   folio's is a mounted layer's declared `site-publisher-<kind>` pipeline
 *   slot (owner, 2026-10-14, Q4 of the folio-assistant#2529
 *   reference-direction review: the FHIR-IG publish path moved to the layer
 *   that owns IG builds). This layer names no publisher above it: what can
 *   publish a repository is whatever that repository's mounts declare;
 * - **main site or preview** follows the branch ({@link chooseTarget}): the
 *   default branch publishes the main site at the root as `publish-main`
 *   does ({@link composeMain}: `publish-main-site.ts`, the `main-site`
 *   render-log entry, `main-site: from <sha>`); any other branch a preview;
 * - every run prints its plan first, `--plan` stops there, and `--dry-run`
 *   builds and composes the commit in a temporary publish-branch worktree
 *   without pushing.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-07: *"do agent-triggered staging next"* — chosen over
 * logging it, after a measurement. smart-ra's dispatch of `staging.yml` that
 * morning (run 37584204273) waited **33 min** for a runner and then ran for
 * 45 s. The agent that asked for it had the checkout, the platform and bun in
 * hand the whole time.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT remove, and says so
 *
 * A push to the publish branch is deployed by GitHub's own `pages build and
 * deployment`, which is ALSO an Actions run. The same morning that run took
 * **47 min**, of which about a minute was work. Nothing here can skip it: the
 * official URL is served by Pages, and Pages deploys on a runner. So this
 * removes the first wait and not the second, and its output says the preview
 * is live only once that deploy has run.
 *
 * ## A folio's preview: the same steps as the workflow, read from the folio
 *
 * The folio's own workflow (`staging.yml`) passes `build_command`,
 * `site_dir`, `folio_dir`, `platform_dir` and `publish_branch` to the
 * reusable `folio-staging.yml`. Those inputs are READ from that file, never
 * restated here, so a folio that changes its build changes it once. Then, in
 * the workflow's order:
 *
 * 1. the slug, by the workflow's rule ({@link slugOf}), refused when it names
 *    no single path segment (bean `fuzm`);
 * 2. the folio's build command, run in the folio checkout;
 * 3. the rail, `rail-standalone-pages.ts`, with the workflow's arguments;
 * 4. the ChangeSet and the rendered impact against the base branch, so the
 *    review page has its data;
 * 5. the banner, `staging-banner.ts`, saying the preview was built locally;
 * 6. the push, held by `staging-push-gate.ts` exactly as the workflow is
 *    (issue #1956): a preview never lands while the main site's Pages build
 *    it would cancel is running. The commit message starts `staging(<slug>)`,
 *    which is how the gate and every later push recognise a staging commit.
 *    The preview REPLACES the slug's directory (bean `85im`), the build is
 *    checked non-empty before anything is deleted (bean `oisv`), and the
 *    render log gets its entry (`render-log.ts`).
 *
 * A preview also carries its build record, `_build-record.json`
 * ({@link writePreviewRecord}): the tree it was built from and a hash of every
 * file. CI rebuilds that tree in full afterwards, off the critical path, and
 * replaces the preview when anything differs (folio-assistant#2881).
 *
 * Not run: the QA sweep, block screenshots, review-comment ingestion and the
 * PR comment. The banner names the preview as built locally so a reviewer is
 * not told those exist.
 *
 * ## `--artifact <dir>`: a preview with no GitHub in the loop
 *
 * The second half of the owner's choice: the same build, written as a BUNDLE a
 * claude.ai Artifact can carry, and nothing pushed. The agent then publishes
 * `<dir>/index.html` with the files `<dir>/artifact.json` lists; it is live in
 * about a minute and private until shared. An Artifact holds at most
 * {@link ARTIFACT_MAX_FILES} files per publish and {@link ARTIFACT_MAX_BYTES}
 * bytes, so when the site is bigger, whole top-level directories are left out,
 * the ones holding the most files first (smart-ra's 2,931 node-kind pages
 * under `en/`), and `artifact.json` names each one left out and how many
 * files it held: a link into one of them 404s in the Artifact, and a reviewer
 * is told rather than left to find out.
