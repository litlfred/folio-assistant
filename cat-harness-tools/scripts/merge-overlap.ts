/**
 * Which open PRs would conflict with each other — the conflict-prediction
 * input for composing merge trains (bean `blgm`; requirements T3 and R7 in
 * `docs/proposals/merge-pipeline-requirements.md`).
 *
 * @module scripts/merge-overlap
 * @graphNode none — a read-only report over git and the open PRs
 * @covers none — a merge-steward report: it predicts, it judges no declared graph
 *
 * ## The rule, at this repository's granularity (SQ19 §5.2)
 *
 * Two PRs are **independent** when their AUTHORED paths do not overlap and
 * neither touches a shared declaration (`merge-pipeline-paths.ts`). Generated
 * paths are excluded, because every pair "conflicts" on them and `merge:train`
 * resolves them by regenerating (R7). A README whose generated regions alone
 * changed is a generated region, not authored text, and is reported apart.
 *
 * ## Where the PRs come from
 *
 * - default: the open PRs over `gh api` (REST), then ONE `git fetch` of their
 *   heads; every diff is then `git diff --name-only <base>...<head>`, the
 *   same as the branch form, so the two sources cannot disagree on a PR.
 * - `--branches a,b,...` or positional refs: no `gh` at all.
 *
 * A PR whose head could not be fetched or diffed is reported with
 * `could_not_determine`, and no pair containing it is called independent
 * (`independent: null`): "could not look" is never "no overlap".
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run merge:overlap                                   # open PRs via gh
 *   bun run merge:overlap -- --branches origin/a,origin/b   # explicit branches
 *   bun run merge:overlap -- origin/a origin/b --base origin/main --no-fetch
 *
 * Exit 0 the report was written · 2 could not list the PRs or resolve the base.
 * The report is JSON on stdout; a one-line summary per conflicting pair on stderr.
