/**
 * search-split.ts — split the site's one search index into one index per
 * SCOPE, plus a manifest naming them.
 *
 * just-the-docs writes ONE `assets/js/search-data.json` for the whole site,
 * so a reader searching one IG page pays to load and index every page of the
 * site. Split by where a page lives, they load only their scope.
 *
 * ## What a scope is — derived, never listed
 *
 * From the page's site-relative URL and two DECLARED facts:
 *
 *   - a LAYER scope when the first path segment is a declared layer's
 *     name (`/<instance>/…`), or the second is and the first is not (`/<kind>/
 *     <instance>/…`, the kind route `mount-instance-docs.ts` also publishes);
 *   - a LOCALE scope when the first segment is one of the platform's declared
 *     target locales (`translation-index.ts`);
 *   - the PLATFORM scope otherwise — except that a platform SECTION (a page's
 *     first path segment, below the root) whose entries exceed
 *     {@link SECTION_BUDGET_BYTES} becomes a `section-<name>` scope of its own.
 *
 * Every entry lands in exactly one scope: their entry counts sum to the
 * source's, which `publish-verify`'s `search-scopes` verifier checks on every
 * published and staged tree.
 *
 * ## What it does not change
 *
 * `search-data.json` itself stays exactly as the theme writes it — staging
 * previews borrow it, and the `search-index` verifier judges it. This writes
 * NEXT to it: `assets/js/search/manifest.json` and one
 * `assets/js/search/<scope>.json` per scope, each in the theme's own entry
 * shape so the theme's loader reads any of them unchanged.
 *
 * ## Stable entry ids — the cone
 *
 * The theme keys entries by a running number, so one added page would rewrite
 * every scope file. The scope files key each entry by a hash of its URL
 * ({@link stableKeys}), so a page change touches only its own scope's files
 * and the manifest. The key is opaque to the client; "search everywhere"
 * loads the theme's whole index with the theme's own keys.
 *
 * ## Prebuilt indexes
 *
 * A scope over {@link PREBUILT_TOKEN_BUDGET} also gets `<scope>.idx.json`:
 * the lunr index the theme would build from it, serialized, and named in the
 * manifest's `index`. The client LOADS it instead of building one, trading
 * download bytes for main-thread time on first search.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/search-split.ts --dir <built site>          # write
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/search-split.ts --dir <built site> --check  # verify only
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/search-split.ts --dir <built site> --repo <checkout>  # scope by that checkout's layers
 *
 * `build-instance-site.ts` runs {@link splitSite} on every site it builds,
 * with the checkout it built from as `repo`.
 *
 * @module scripts/search-split
