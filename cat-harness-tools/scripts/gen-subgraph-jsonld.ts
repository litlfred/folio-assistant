/**
 * Emit every NAMED SUBGRAPH's pair of JSON-LD files — `index.jsonld` and
 * `index.hydrated.jsonld` — by framing kg-export's one in-memory graph.
 *
 * The contract is `skills/kg/kg-core/kg-export.md` §"Named subgraphs — one
 * IRI, two files, framed from one graph", and the schema both files validate
 * against is `schemas/kg/subgraph-manifest.ts`.
 *
 * ## What is a subgraph here
 *
 * Every directory under each of this layer's declared knowledge-graph
 * directories (`kgDirectories(…, "instance")`) and under each framed
 * layer's declared `tools` graph ({@link subgraphDirectories}), nested ones
 * included — so `skills/` and `skills/sdlc/` are both subgraphs, and the second
 * is a child of the first. Above them is the ROOT, the harness instance
 * itself, whose IRI is `<BASE_URL>/subgraph/<HARNESS>/`.
 *
 * ## Membership is containment, and every node lands exactly once
 *
 * - A node with a source path inside a kg directory is a direct member of the
 *   DEEPEST subgraph directory containing it (a package's own directory, for a
 *   package node).
 * - A node with no path is a member of whatever subgraph its `partOf` parent
 *   is in — a ProcessNode is part of a diagram, not a file. The same rule
 *   `stampSubgraph` uses for `inSubgraph`, to a fixed point.
 * - A node of a layer stacked on this one lands in that layer's own
 *   tree, `<BASE_URL>/subgraph/<ITS NAME>/…`, by the same containment rule
 *   over its declared directories — a path outside them falls to that
 *   layer's root.
 * - A Tool node has no source path: it is placed by the folder convention
 *   (`schemas/tools/tool-folders.ts`, `<tools dir>/<id>/<id>.ts`) in its OWN
 *   layer's `tools` subgraph — `tools/<id>/` when that folder is on disk,
 *   else the `tools/` directory itself.
 * - Everything else — schemas, roles, graph typologies — is a direct member
 *   of its own harness's ROOT.
 *
 * ## Each layer is framed from its OWN export
 *
 * A stacked layer's nodes are read from that layer's export, under the
 * `@id`s its published document gives them. Which layers are framed is
 * {@link framedInstances}: the corpus this layer's checkout scope reaches.
 * A node's paths are relative to the layer that exported it, so the plan is
 * told which one (`rootOf`).
 *
 * Above every root is the REPOSITORY's index, `<BASE_URL>/subgraph/`, whose
 * `hasSubgraph` are the roots framed here. `bootstrap` and `bootstrap-tools`
 * sit below this layer and publish through their own graph; their
 * repository indexes are linked with `rdfs:seeAlso` — a link a reader may
 * follow, never membership.
 *
 * Transitive membership is `hasMember` followed through `hasSubgraph`, which
 * is exactly what the hydrated file nests.
 *
 * A node this cannot place — a path inside a kg directory that is not on disk,
 * or a `partOf` naming a node the graph does not hold — goes in `problems`,
 * and the run exits 1 having written nothing.
 *
 * ## One graph, two frames
 *
 * Both files come out of `jsonld.frame` over the SAME source nodes: the
 * index frame embeds nothing (`@embed: @never`) except each direct member's
 * pointer projection — `@id`, `@type` and label, under `@explicit`; the
 * hydrated frame embeds every member whole and every child subgraph whole
 * (`@embed: @always`), while every edge between KG nodes stays an IRI. The
 * root gets the index only, so no one document holds the whole graph.
 *
 * `@context` is the URL of `ns/subgraph/v1.jsonld`, which this script also
 * writes — kg-export's context without its keyword aliases (so the files say
 * `@id`, not `id`) plus the two subgraph terms. It is never inlined.
 *
 * ## Heavy bodies stay pointers
 *
 * The KG carries a skill's body as `instructionsPath`, a diagram as
 * `sourcePath`, a schema as `module` — never the text. This script refuses a
 * literal over {@link HEAVY_LITERAL_BYTES} rather than trimming it (fix it in
 * kg-export).
 *
 * For the fields `HEAVY_POINTERS` names (`schemas/kg/subgraph-manifest.ts`), the
 * TARGET is published as a PAYLOAD: one immutable file per distinct body at
 * `docs/payload/sha256/<hex>`, served at `<BASE_URL>/payload/sha256/<hex>`,
 * with its media type in `<hex>.json` beside it. The node carries a `payload`
 * link — `@id`, `sha256`, `bytes` — in both its index pointer and its hydrated
 * form. Identical bodies are one file. {@link auditPayloadTree} fails a payload
 * no node references, a node whose payload is missing, and bytes that do not
 * hash to their name; it runs on every write and under `--check`.
 *
 * Output is deterministic — no timestamps, no commit, keys and members
 * sorted — so `--check` can compare bytes.
 *
 * Every file it writes carries a top-level `_generated` key
 * ({@link SUBGRAPH_GENERATED}), which `check:reference-direction` reads as "a
 * generator wrote this" (a subgraph file names the layers whose nodes it
 * frames). The subgraph context declares `_generated` as a `@json` term
 * ({@link subgraphContext}), so the files stay valid JSON-LD.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/gen-subgraph-jsonld.ts            # write
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/gen-subgraph-jsonld.ts --check    # verify
 *
 * Output: `docs/subgraph/<HARNESS>/<PATH>/index[.hydrated].jsonld` (served at
 * `<BASE_URL>/subgraph/…`, since `docs/` is the site root) and
 * `ns/subgraph/v1.jsonld` (copied to `<BASE_URL>/ns/subgraph/v1.jsonld` by the
 * docs workflows, beside `ns/content/v1.jsonld`).
 *
 * @module scripts/gen-subgraph-jsonld
 * @covers computed — the subgraphs are every directory under `kgDirectories(instance)` and the declared `tools` graphs

 * The own-namespace prefixes (`ownPrefixTable()` keys — each a layer's stub) a
 * subgraph file written under `root` may use as CURIEs: the stubs of `root`'s
 * layer and of every layer it `needs`, transitively. `undefined` when
 * `root`'s declaration is not among the checkout's layers — nothing is
 * known about its reach, so nothing is narrowed.
 *
 * ## Why (bean `folio-assistant-63q4`)
 *
 * Every subgraph file is written under `root`'s `docs/`, so the file BELONGS
 * to `root`'s layer, and `check:jsonld-contexts` (`gen-instance-contexts`)
 * resolves the prefixes it uses through that layer's flattened table —
 * its own, plus those of what it `needs`. The framing context used to bind
 * every own prefix (`ownPrefixTable()`), so an IRI in the namespace of a layer ABOVE
 * `root` compacted to a CURIE: cat-harness's root frames the content layer's graph kinds
 * (`<content prefix>:graphTypology/catalogue`, …), and the overlaid
 * content-core tree names its own. cat-harness does not need core
 * — core is above it — so the CURIE was unbound in the one table that governs
 * the file, and `jsonld:contexts` failed `derive:publish`.
 *
 * Leaving the prefix out compacts such an IRI to its full absolute form,
 * which expands to the identical triple: the N-Quads do not move, only the
 * spelling does. The reach is computed the way the gate computes it
 * (`readInstanceDecls`, `needs`), so the two cannot disagree.
 *
 * ## A needed layer the checkout does not hold is still in reach (bean `cat-tools-d5j0`)
 *
 * The reach is a property of the declarations, not of what else happens to be
 * checked out beside `root`. In the sibling-clone layout `checkoutRootFor`
 * stops at cat-harness's own `.git`, so `bootstrap`, which cat-harness
 * `needs`, is not among the checkout's layers. It used to be skipped, so
 * the `bootstrap` prefix fell out of cat-harness's `ns/subgraph/v1.jsonld`
 * and `publish-check` called the committed file, which is correct, stale.
 *
 * A `needs` name with no layer here is kept when it is an own prefix
 * ({@link ownPrefixTable}, keyed by stub). An absent layer has no
 * declaration to read, so its stub is taken to be its name, which is the
 * default `readInstanceDecls` applies. Its own `needs` cannot be followed. A
 * name that is neither in the checkout nor an own prefix binds nothing, as
 * before.

 * mount; `compose-docs` lays that twin over the mount. The twin is complete,
 * so strays and the payload audit are judged in it alone. `--check` judges
 * the twin once one exists, else the pinned tree. In the layer's own
