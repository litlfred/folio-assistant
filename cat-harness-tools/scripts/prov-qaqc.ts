/**
 * The QA/QC report over PROV-O: the agentic engine's after-check.
 *
 * The deterministic engine checks the ODRL policy BEFORE a task and refuses
 * (`src/workflow/authorize.ts`). An agent swarm acts first, so the same
 * policy is checked AFTER, from the record of what was done.
 *
 * For every workflow instance in `beans/workflows/` (and every subprocess
 * instance inside it), for each history entry whose node is an activity or a
 * decision in its process model:
 *
 * 1. **The record.** One `prov:Activity`, validated by `ProvActivitySchema`:
 *    `prov:agent` is the entry's actor, `prov:hadRole` the role the node's
 *    lane binds (`laneBinding`), `prov:hadPlan` `<process stem>#<node id>`,
 *    `prov:startedAtTime` the entry's `at`, and `cat-harness:underPolicy` the
 *    uid(s) of every policy evaluated. Written per instance to
 *    `docs/assets/prov/<instance>.prov.jsonld`.
 * 2. **The check.** `authorizeTask`, the before-check itself, re-run with the
 *    principal `asserted`, because history records only a name. Nothing is
 *    re-implemented here.
 *
 * ## Nothing is invented
 *
 * `ProvAssociationSchema` requires `prov:agent` and `prov:hadRole` (stricter
 * than PROV-O, where `hadRole` is optional; the page says so). An entry with
 * no actor, or in a lane that binds no role, cannot honestly fill them, so NO
 * activity is emitted for it and the gap is a finding (`no-actor`,
 * `no-role`).
 *
 * ## Advisory: findings do not fail the build
 *
 * A finding is reported, never fatal (as in `authorize.ts`). `--check` fails
 * only on stale outputs, a `prov:Activity` that does not validate, or an
 * internal error (a process model that cannot be loaded). `unknown` is never
 * read as permit.
 *
 * Usage:  bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/prov-qaqc.ts [--check]
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/prov-qaqc
 * @covers workflow-state, policies, scenarios — it re-checks the ODRL policy AFTER the fact
 *   from the workflow record, so its subjects are the instance state, the policies it grades
 *   against, and the role graph naming the actors

# PROV-O QA/QC report

The after-check for the agentic engine (issue #1180, step 5). The deterministic engine checks the ODRL policy **before** a task and refuses. An agent swarm acts first, so this report checks the **same** policy **after** the fact. It reads each workflow instance's history, writes it as W3C PROV-O, and re-runs \`authorizeTask\`, the before-check, on every step. Because history records only a name, the actor is treated as \`asserted\`.

**Advisory.** The owner chose advisory first (2026-09-23), so findings are reported here and do not fail the build. \`check:prov-qaqc\` fails only when these outputs are stale, when a \`prov:Activity\` does not validate against \`ProvActivitySchema\`, or on an internal error. \`unknown\` is never read as permit.

**Nothing is invented.** An entry with no actor, or in a lane that binds no role, gets no \`prov:Activity\`, because the schema requires \`prov:agent\` and \`prov:hadRole\`. It gets a finding instead. Every entry is \`asserted\`, so that is not listed as a finding.

**\`prov:hadRole\` stays required.** PROV-O makes it optional, and the owner decided on 2026-09-24 to keep it required here anyway ("Keep required"): a step in a lane that binds no role is reported as \`no-role\`, never logged without a role.

## Totals

${r.instances.size} instance(s), ${t.checked} step(s) checked, ${t.activities} \`prov:Activity\` emitted, ${totalFindings} finding(s). Policies evaluated: ${r.policies.map((p) => `\`${p}\``).join(", ") || "none"}.
