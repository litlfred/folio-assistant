/**
 * Read `schemas/*.ts` as a graph of declarations and the edges between them.
 *
 * @module scripts/schema-graph
 * @graphNode none — a reader over the schema graph, not a schema itself
 *
 * `schemas/` is a declared graph typology holding **content** (`BASE_GRAPH_TYPOLOGIES`:
 * *"a shape is the subject matter of the schema graph"*) but is
 * `renderable: false`; this is the reader that lets it be looked at. The
 * projection built from it is gated — see `gen-schema-viz.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why the AST, not the type checker or the published JSON Schema
 *
 * Both alternatives **erase the edges a class diagram is made of**:
 *
 * - **The published JSON Schema.** `harness-schema-export.ts` renders with
 *   `$refStrategy: "none"`, right for a dereferenceable document, so a named
 *   schema like `ContentDirectory` is an anonymous object repeated at each use
 *   site.
 *
 * - **The TypeScript type checker.** `z.infer<typeof FooSchema>` resolves to a
 *   deeply expanded structural type, so `Foo.bar` comes back as the whole of
 *   `Bar` inlined rather than a reference to it.
 *
 * Only the syntactic form still holds `bar: BarSchema` as a reference to a
 * named thing. That is the edge; everything else is a property of a box.
 * `typescript` is already a direct dependency, so the viewer built over this
 * keeps `kg-viewer.ts`'s rule of no CDN and no third party.
 *
 * ## Resolution is syntactic, and says so
 *
 * A referenced name is resolved in this order: an export of the same module,
 * then through that module's import map to the exporting module. A name that
 * is neither is recorded in {@link SchemaDecl.unresolved} rather than dropped
 * — usually a type from outside the schema graph.
 *
 * ## Three states, and `undetermined` is never a pass
 *
 * A Zod expression this walker does not recognise yields
 * `kind: "undetermined"` **with the head of the expression recorded in
 * `note`** — never an empty object that renders as a type with no fields.
 * `z.lazy`, a 16-member union and the registry pattern in `cat-harness.ts` are
 * the real cases.

 * a graph — the `wggr` guard, which exists because returning the first
 * silently once resolved `cat-harness` to `schemas/` and wrote 37 sidecars

 *
 * It threw the moment this branch met main. Four layers declare a

 * `large-datasets/schemas/` and `detangle/schemas/` — so the singular question
 * has no answer, and the guard said so rather than picking one. **The right
 * fix is not to pick one.** The schema graph genuinely spans layers, a
 * viewer that showed one of four would report a corpus that does not exist,

 * collide.

 * ## Why this replaced a plain import map, and why it is not a deny-list
 *
 * The first version collected every identifier mentioned in an expression and
 * tried to resolve each one. Measured: the top "unresolved reference" in the
 * whole graph was **`z`**, at 151 occurrences — the Zod namespace object,
 * mentioned in every schema and a declaration in none. `Record`, `Array`,
 * `Set` and a tail of lowercase noise followed it.
 *
 * The tempting fix is a list of names to ignore. That is a second, drifting
 * statement of the schema graph's vocabulary, and this repository has paid for
 * that shape before. The fix here needs no list: **a name is a candidate
 * reference only if the module BINDS it** — declares it, or imports it. `z`
 * is bound, to `zod`, which is not a relative import and therefore not part of
 * this graph; `Record` and `Array` are globals and bound by nothing. Both fall
