/**
 * Every link out of the files an agent reads FIRST still resolves.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-agent-entry-links
 * @covers docs, skills
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` is the file every agent opens before anything else. The two
 * neighbouring checks each miss its outbound links by design:
 *
 * | check | covers |
 * |---|---|
 * | `readme:audit` | `README.md` only |
 * | `check:agents-xref` | section citations **into** `AGENTS.md` |
 * | *this* | links **out of** every agent entry file |
 *
 * It reuses the generic auditor, `src/core/markdown-links.ts`:
 * relative-path-against-working-tree, ref-aware and Pages-aware checking,
 * with a third state for what it could not check.
 *
 * ## Discovery, not a list
 *
 * The entry files are FOUND, not listed (a list would go stale like the
 * links): the three agent-generic names, at the repository root and at any
 * layer root (e.g. `bootstrap/AGENTS.md`), skipping vendored and published
 * trees.
 *
 * ## A moved path
 *
 * A link into a path some layer has moved resolves at the new place while
 * that layer's `moves` entry is in its window (sdlc skill
 * `two-phase-move`), and is reported as moved, not dead; past `until` it is
 * dead again.
