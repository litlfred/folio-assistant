/**
 * Pin every third-party GitHub Action to a full commit SHA, keeping the
 * human-readable ref as a trailing comment: `uses: owner/repo@<sha> # v4`.
 * Bean `ieum`, issue #2389.
 *
 * GitHub's Secure use reference: *"Pinning an action to a full-length commit
 * SHA is currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release."* A
 * tag can be moved, and a branch is moved by design. Measured 2026-10-07: 0 of
 * 240 `uses:` lines here were pinned. Dependabot keeps a `@<sha> # <tag>` pair
 * current when the comment is on the same line, so pinning does not freeze a
 * version.
 *
 * ## Which workflows must pin: the owner's rulings, 2026-10-07
 *
 * First *"when published, make it unpinned on staging"*; then, once the roast
 * (bean `1ygp`, L4.1) found a staging workflow holding `contents: write` on
 * `pull_request_target` and pushing to the branch that serves the live site,
 * *"pin write-token workflows"*. So every workflow pins, except one listed in
 * {@link STAGING_ONLY_WORKFLOWS} that also passes {@link stagingExempt}: no
 * write permission, and no `pull_request_target` trigger. The list is a
 * reviewed one-line change, and the list alone never grants the exemption.
 *
 * **First-party reusable workflows** (`<this repo>/.github/workflows/x.yml@main`)
 * are not third-party code and are left as they are.
 *
 * ## Resolution is by `git ls-remote`, as argv, and it refuses rather than guesses
 *
 * A ref resolves to the PEELED commit of a tag (`refs/tags/v4^{}`) when the
 * tag is annotated, else the tag, else a branch head. A ref that resolves to
 * nothing, or to more than one commit, is REFUSED: the line is left unpinned
 * and reported, because pinning to a guess would be a silent repair.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat actions:pin            # rewrite workflows in place
 *   bun run cat actions:pin --dry-run  # report what would change
 *   bun run cat actions:pin --verify-refs  # NETWORK: check each SHA is its `# <ref>`'s commit
 *
 * @graphNode tool
 * @covers none — .github/workflows/ is not a declared graph typology
