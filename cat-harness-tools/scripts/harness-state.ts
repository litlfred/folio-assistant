/**
 * Where each harness got to in its initialization, and how healthy it is —
 * worked out from the checkout at publish time, never committed.
 *
 * @covers none — writer — it writes one state file per harness into the built site; it judges nothing
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat harness:state --out ./_site/assets/harnesses   # what the deploy runs
 * bun run cat harness:state --json                            # print, write nothing
 * ```
 *
 * ## Where the answer comes from
 *
 * The steps are bootstrap-tools' `initSteps` — the tool half of bootstrap's
 * `complete-initialization.bpmn` — run with `dryRun` and the `offlineProbe`,
 * so this writes nothing into any layer and touches no network. A step that
 * needs the network (the documents answering at their IRIs, Pages being live)
 * is therefore `could-not-determine` here, never done. The declarations name
 * the steps; there is no second list.
 *
 * ## What one file says (`folio-harness-state/v1`)
 *
 * - `initialization.position`: the first `not-done` step, or `complete` when
 *   none is. `next` is that step's `action`: what to do, said and not done.
 * - `initialization.counts`: steps per state.
 * - `health.badges`: one per health notion that is the HARNESS's, not the
 *   repository's. `initialization` is red on any `not-done` step, unknown when
 *   only `could-not-determine` steps are left, green otherwise.
 *   `repository` reads the layer's own committed health report
 *   (`healthReportPath`) when there is one, and is `unknown` when there is
 *   not, which in an index checkout is the usual case.
 *
 * Paths in `detail` and `action` are made relative to the checkout, so a
 * published file never carries the build machine's directories.
 *
 * ## A partial mount is not a missing directory
 *
 * An index mounts some layers in part: `index.lock.json` lists the
 * directories it brought. A file the lock did not bring may exist upstream,
 * so for such a layer every step that looks for a file is
 * `could-not-determine` here, never `not-done` ({@link partiallyMounted}).
 *
 * Deterministic: layers in name order, steps in the order `initSteps`
 * gives, and no time is written.
 *
