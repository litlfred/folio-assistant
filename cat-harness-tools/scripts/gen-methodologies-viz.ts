/**
 * Render the `methodology` graph — what each adopted method is FOR, where it
 * came from, and whether this checkout holds the source it rests on.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/gen-methodologies-viz
 * @covers methodology
 *
 * It does not walk the graph: the node list and the evidence join come from
 * `check-methodology-evidence.ts` — `methodologyNodes` for the fields a reader
 * needs, `checkMethodologyEvidence` for which citations resolve — so the page
 * cannot disagree with the gate. Nothing here opens a `methodologies/`
 * directory or parses front matter.
 *
 * ## Three evidence states, kept visibly apart
 *
 * | state | means | how it reads |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | **ingested** | `evidence:` resolves in a declared library | the source is named and openable |
 * | **cited only** | an `origin`, no `evidence:` field | an open question, reported and not gated |
 * | **dangling** | `evidence:` names a bib-slug no library holds | a citation that CLAIMS to resolve — worse than none |
 *
 * If no directory declares a `methodology` graph, this REFUSES rather than
 * writing an empty page.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/gen-methodologies-viz.ts
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/gen-methodologies-viz.ts --check
