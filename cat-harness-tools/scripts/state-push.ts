/**
 * state-push — send the mount's edits to the branch THROUGH the library.
 *
 * @module scripts/state-push
 * @graphNode none — the write half of the state mount
 * @covers none — it writes a state graph's edits to its branch and judges nothing
 *
 * `bun run cat state:push` splices every graph with branch-store's
 * {@link pushMount}, once per graph, to the branch that graph's mount was
 * read from (`state-mount.ts`).
 *
 * ## Why not `git push`
 *
 * A push of the tree the editor started from reverts a sibling's write to a
 * DIFFERENT file landed meanwhile, and overwrites a sibling's write to the
 * SAME file. What goes to the remote instead is a SPLICE: only the paths that
 * actually changed, grafted onto whatever the tip is now, every other file
 * carried across by id.
 *
 * ## The `expect` is the whole safety story
 *
 * The mount marker records the blob each file had at the mounted tip — what
 * the editor read, i.e. `Change.expect`. A sibling who edited the same file
 * since gets this write stopped as `conflict` with the paths named, and
 * NOTHING is pushed for that graph. A file the editor created carries
 * `expect: null`, so two sessions creating the same bean are told instead of
 * both believing they did.
 *
 * ## Which graphs: the declarations AND the mounts
 *
 * Every declared tip-keyed graph, plus every graph mounted in this worktree
 * whose declaration has since gone: a mount's marker records its branch, so
 * its edits are never stranded.
 *
 * ## It never discards edits
 *
 * On `conflict` or `failed` the mount is left exactly as it is: the edits are
 * the only copy.
 *
 * ## It retags the beans first
 *
 * Before the splice, every bean in the mounted store gets back its
 * `$schema: bean/1.0.0` (`beans-retag.ts`), which the `beans` CLI drops
 * whenever it rewrites a bean. The retag only edits files in the mount. It is
 * skipped on `--dry-run`, which must not write, and a retag that cannot run is
 * reported and does not stop the push.
 *
 * ## It judges the text it splices
 *
 * A state branch has no CI in front of it, and on 2026-11-05 a work item's
 * link to a moved path reddened every layer's CI from there (bean `asq1`).
 * So before each splice the Markdown files it writes are run through the
 * dangling-link and retired-word checks (`state-push-checks.ts`), and a graph
 * whose push would INTRODUCE a finding is refused, with the findings named.
 * A finding already at the tip does not block. `CAT_GATES_BYPASS='<reason>'`
 * pushes anyway and logs the reason with the findings, the same bypass and
 * the same log as the pre-push gates (cat-harness-tools#1487).
