/**
 * Is this lock fresh, and do its harness pins agree with the pinned harnesses' own locks (reported; gating only with `--agreement`)?
 *
 * A layer's lock pins every harness it mounts: `mounts[]`, one
 * `{ harness, repository, ref }` each. Each pinned harness Y has its OWN
 * `index.lock.json` at its pinned commit, which pins the harnesses below it.
 * The pins disagree when the layer pins harness X at A while Y, at the commit
 * the layer pins, pins X at B and A does not contain B: A is older than B, or
 * on another line of history. Y was built and tested against X at B; mounting
 * Y with X at an older A runs Y against an X it never saw.
 *
 * ## Why "A contains B", not "A = B"
 *
 * Re-pins go upward one layer at a time: X moves, then Y re-pins X, then the
 * layer re-pins both. A layer that is AHEAD of Y on X (A descends from B) runs
 * Y against a newer X, which is what every re-pin of X does until Y follows,
 * and is what the standing re-pinner produces. Equality would fail every
 * layer between the two re-pins. A layer BEHIND Y on X is the skew that broke
 * a content layer's main (owner, 2026-11-11): the PR's fast tier was green,
 * its pins were half new mains and half old, and 7 tests failed on main until
 * a re-pin moved all five to current mains.
 *
 * ## Fresh: every pin at its repository's main, or ahead of it
 *
 * Agreement alone does not catch that skew itself: the layer pinned
 * cat-harness and cat-harness-tools AHEAD of its content core's own pins
 * of them, while the core was left at an old commit, and no lock records that a
 * lower layer moved past what an upper one was built for. So the second rule
 * (owner, 2026-11-11, card "A: Agree check + freshness"): on a pull request
 * that changes `index.lock.json`, every pinned harness is at its
 * repository's `main` HEAD as the run finds it, or at a descendant of it. A
 * pin behind main, or diverged from it, fails, naming the harness, the
 * pinned SHA, main's SHA and the fix (re-pin to main). A re-pin therefore
 * moves every layer together, which is what turned that main green.
 * "As the run finds it" is now "as the lock was written" (the next section,
 * owner, 2026-11-13, card "Lock gate", "Fresh at re-pin time").
 * `--no-freshness` judges agreement alone.
 *
 * ## Fresh at re-pin time (owner, 2026-11-13, card "Lock gate")
 *
 * "At main as the run finds it" raced the layers' own merges: with mains
 * moving every few minutes, a re-pin that was current when written went red
 * before its CI finished, because main gained a merge made after the re-pin.
 * The owner's ruling, option "Fresh at re-pin time": "Pass a pin that was
 * main when the lock was written (every commit main gained since is newer
 * than the re-pin commit). Kills the race, keeps 'all layers at main
 * together'." So the rule judges against T, the committer date of the last
 * commit that changed the lock (`git log -1 --format=%cI -- index.lock.json`
 * in the repository that holds `--lock`; merging main into the pull request
 * leaves T alone unless it touches the lock; an uncommitted lock is being
 * written now, so T is now). A pin P is fresh when it is main or descends
 * from it, or when P is behind main and every commit on main's first-parent
 * chain after P (`P..main --first-parent`) has a committer date after T: P
 * was main's tip when the lock was written. A pin behind main with a
 * first-parent commit dated at or before T was already behind when written,
 * and is stale; a diverged pin is stale. A T, or a main history, that
 * cannot be read is could-not-determine. Committer dates come from different
 * machines, so clock skew between them can move a commit to the wrong side
 * of T by that skew; that is accepted, since the window it opens is minutes
 * and the next re-pin closes it. `--at-run-time` keeps the strict rule
 * above, every pin at main as the run finds it, for an audit.
 *
 * ## Three states, never two
 *
 * A lower lock that is absent at the pin (bootstrap-tools has none) has
 * nothing to disagree with. A fetch that failed, or an ancestry git could not
 * evaluate, is `could-not-determine`, reported with its reason and never
 * read as agreement; a main that could not be read is never read as fresh.
 * Exit: 0 every pin is fresh · 1 a pin is stale · 2 neither, but something
 * could not be determined. Agreement counts toward the exit only with
 * `--agreement` (see "Only the top-level lock decides").
 *
 * ## Only the top-level lock decides (owner, 2026-11-13: "3y 1y")
 *
 * A composition mounts each harness ONCE, at the pin of the top-level index
 * (the instance being built, or the hub). The locks inside the mounted
 * layers are what each layer was last tested with on its own; they are not
 * read by the mount. Requiring them to agree with the top-level pins made
 * every re-pin a serial, bottom-up cascade, and concurrent merges kept
 * making it stale again. So agreement is REPORTED, as a note on what a lower
 * layer was last tested with, and does not fail the run. The one rule that
 * gates is freshness: a pull request that changes the lock pins every harness
 * at its main or ahead of it, so the top-level composition is current. This
 * replaces the owner's 2026-11-11 card "A: Agree check + freshness" for the
 * agreement half. The skew it guarded against (committed generated files
 * computed from an older lower layer) goes away as option 3 of the same
 * ruling moves those files from commits to build time.
 * `--agreement` restores the old gate for a one-off audit.
 *
 * ## The network
 *
 * Each repository is fetched once, with git, into a bare repository under the
 * cache directory (`--cache`, default `$RUNNER_TEMP` or the OS temp
 * directory), commits only (`--filter=tree:0`); a lower lock is read at its
 * pin with `git show`, which fetches just that tree and blob. Ancestry is
 * `git-ancestry.ts`' `relate`, so a shallow or partial history is never a
 * "no".
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat lock:coherence:check                        # ./index.lock.json: freshness gates, agreement reported
 *   bun run cat lock:coherence:check -- --agreement         # agreement gates too (an audit)
 *   bun run cat lock:coherence:check -- --no-freshness      # agreement alone, reported
 *   bun run cat lock:coherence:check -- --at-run-time       # every pin at main as the run finds it (an audit)
 *   bun run cat lock:coherence:check -- --lock <file>       # another lock file
 *   bun run cat lock:coherence:check -- --repo <owner>/<layer>@main
 *                                                           # a repository's lock at a ref, read with git
 *   bun run cat lock:coherence:check -- --changed-from <base>
 *                                                           # pass at once when index.lock.json is unchanged since <base>
 *   bun run cat lock:coherence:check -- --json              # the report as JSON
 *
 * CI: job `lock-coherence` of `layer-pr-checks.yml`, on every pull request
 * that changes the caller's `index.lock.json`.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-lock-coherence
 * @covers none — it judges a lock's pins against the pinned layers' own locks, not a declared graph typology
 * @graphNode tool
