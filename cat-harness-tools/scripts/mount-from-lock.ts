/**
 * Lay down every remote mount a committed lock records — from the LOCK alone,
 * with nothing but Node's own modules.
 *
 * `remote-mount.ts` PLANS a mount: it reads the harness's declaration at the
 * pin (through `schemas/kg/cat-harness.ts`, whose imports reach into
 * `bootstrap-tools/schemas/`), follows `needs` across the closure, checks
 * trust and writes the lock. It cannot load until `bootstrap-tools` is
 * mounted, so this script does the one part that needs no declaration:
 * REPLAYING a lock. Every decision — which instances, which repository, which
 * commit, which directories, where — is in the committed lock; what is left
 * is fetch, copy and verify. So it imports only `node:*`, runs on a fresh
 * clone, and is what CI and the session-start hook run first.
 * `mount:remote` stays the only writer of a lock.
 *
 * ## What it guarantees
 *
 * - **Pinned and verified.** Each instance is fetched at the lock's 40-char
 *   SHA, and each directory's bytes must hash to the lock's `treeDigest`
 *   (the same digest `kg-parts.ts` computes) — a mismatch is undone and
 *   reported, never kept. Trust was checked when the lock was written; the
 *   digest is what makes replaying it safe.
 * - **Never over somebody's work.** A path that holds tracked files, or holds
 *   bytes that no longer hash to the lock, is left untouched and reported —
 *   unless those bytes hash to what an EARLIER committed version of the same
 *   lock pinned at that path ({@link priorPins}). Those are a stale mount, not
 *   an edit (bean folio-assistant-jstq), and are replaced; the state mounts and
 *   `node_modules/` inside them are carried over.
 * - **Three states.** `mounted` / `current` exit 0, `missing` (refused or
 *   absent) exits 1, `could-not-determine` (fetch failed, lock unreadable)
 *   exits 2 — never folded into one another.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat mount:lock                 # lay down / refresh every locked mount
 *   bun run cat mount:lock -- --check      # no network: is every locked mount on disk and intact?
 *   bun run cat mount:lock -- --root <dir> # the downstream instance root (default: cwd)
 *   bun run cat mount:lock -- --no-install # lay the bytes down, do not `bun install` in each mount
 *   bun run cat mount:lock -- --install-all # install devDependencies too (default: --omit dev)
 *   bun run cat mount:lock -- --no-layers-cache # skip the shared layers cache ref, fetch each repository
 *   bun run cat layers:publish             # (= --publish) build the overlay of the verified mounts, push refs/cat/layers/<key>
 *   bun run cat layers:publish -- --main --prune 20 [--keep <key>]… [--url <index remote>] [--no-push]
 *   bun run cat layers:check               # (= --check-layers) gate: refs/cat/layers/<key> for THIS lock exists at the index remote
 *   bun run cat layers:check -- --changed-from <base> # the same, only when index.lock.json differs from <base> (a re-pin)
 *
 * The FAST PATH: before fetching instance by instance, the replay tries ONE
 * shallow fetch of the index's layers cache ref (`refs/cat/layers/<key>`, then
 * `refs/cat/layers/main`) and verifies every byte it takes from it against the
 * lock; see "The shared layers cache ref" below.
 *
 * `CAT_MOUNT_URL_PREFIX` replaces `https://github.com` in fetch URLs (tests
 * serve local bare repositories this way); a repository that is already a URL
 * or an absolute path is used as it stands.
 *
 * @graphNode none — a command-line tool; the lock's shape is `schemas/kg/remote-mount.ts`
 * @covers none — replays a lock; `mount:remote:check` is the gate on the lock itself

//
// A mounted layer is CODE (`cat-harness`, `cat-harness-tools`, …), and code
// with no `node_modules` does not run: `Cannot find module
// '@litlfred/cat-harness/schemas/kg/mount-trust.js'`. Until 2026-10-12 the
// workaround was a hand `bun install` inside the mount, and that made the mount
// read MODIFIED: `--check` said "the pinned bytes are not on disk:
// cat-harness/ modified" and the next re-mount refused it.
//
// Two routes were on the table. (1) Resolve the workspace packages WITHOUT
// writing into the mount — a generated workspace manifest at the downstream
// root. Rejected: it edits the downstream's tracked `package.json`, and bun's
// default (isolated) linker writes a `node_modules/` into every workspace
// member anyway, i.e. into the mounts, so it does not even keep them pristine.
// (2) Install INTO the mount and define what fixity covers. Taken, because the
// question fixity answers is "are the PINNED bytes on disk", and an install
// writes none of them:
//
// - `node_modules/`, at any depth, is excluded from every mount digest — the
//   lock's writer (`remote-mount.ts`), its replayer (this file) and both
//   `--check`s, through this one function. At any depth because bun's isolated
//   linker also writes into the SIBLING mounts a manifest's `workspaces` names
//   (`../cat-harnes[s]`). Nothing upstream tracks a `node_modules/` (measured
//   2026-10-12 over cat-harness, cat-harness-tools, bootstrap, bootstrap-tools
//   and two content instances: 0 paths), and `remote-mount.ts` refuses
//   to lay down a tree that does, so the exclusion can never hide a pinned byte.
// - The lockfile is NOT excluded: it is a pinned byte. The install runs with
//   `--no-save`, so bun writes no lockfile and edits no manifest, and the
//   lockfile's bytes are compared before and after and put back if anything
//   moved them — a mount stays verifiable by the same digest it was locked at.

// ── The shared layers cache ref ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Replaying a lock fetches every pinned instance from its own repository: one
// round trip, one negotiation, one sparse checkout per layer. The layers
// cache is ONE git commit in the INDEX repository whose tree is the composed
// overlay this file lays down — each locked directory at its mount path, each
// declaration and asset, nothing an install or a state mount wrote — so a
// fresh checkout mounts every layer with one shallow fetch.
//
// It is keyed by the lock: `refs/cat/layers/<sha256 of the lock's
// instances>`, plus a moving `refs/cat/layers/main` that the writer on main
// updates. The lock stays the SOLE authority. The cache is untrusted: every
// byte taken from it is verified by {@link layDownFrom} exactly as a fetched
// byte is, an instance whose copy does not verify falls back to its own
// repository, and a missing ref falls back for all of them. So a stale cache
// (`main` after a re-pin) still serves every layer that did not move, and a
// tampered one can cost time, never correctness. Trust was checked when the
// lock was written; nothing here changes that.
//
// Whoever writes the lock writes the ref: `bun run cat layers:publish`
// (this file's `--publish`) over a checkout whose mounts `--check` reads
// current. It refuses any other state, so it can only publish bytes that
// already hash to the lock.
