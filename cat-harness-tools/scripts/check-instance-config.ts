/**
 * Every instance's config is named after the instance, and no retired name
 * survives.
 *
 * The config is `<instance>.config.json`. A retired name is not read at all,
 * so a checkout still on one silently loses its settings unless something
 * says so; this does.
 *
 * ## What it checks, and the third state
 *
 * For every instance in the checkout:
 *
 *   - a config named after the instance, or none at all — both fine;
 *   - a config under the RETIRED global name — a finding, with the `git mv`
 *     to run, because nothing reads it and nothing else would say so;
 *   - a `*.config.json` at the instantiation root matching no declared
 *     instance, and no harness a subscription chose — a finding, because
 *     it is either a rename half-done or a config for an instance that is
 *     not here, and the two are worth telling apart by hand.
 *
 * COULD-NOT-DETERMINE is its own exit. An unreadable declaration means the
 * instance's name is unknown, so its filename is unknowable — reported, never
 * folded into "no finding".
 *
