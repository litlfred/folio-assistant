/**
 * The CHANGES page of a staging preview: `STAGING/<slug>/changes/`.
 *
 * Three lists, each from a tool that already answers it; this file computes
 * none of them anew except the first one's mount expansion and the folding
 * the third needs:
 *
 * | list | from |
 * |---|---|
 * | 1. changed SOURCE assets | the branch's file list, with every re-pinned mount in `index.lock.json` EXPANDED into the files that changed between its two pins (`expandRepins`) |
 * | 2. downstream RENDERED assets, predicted | the docs renderer's `rendered-impact.json` (skill `rendered-impact`), computed over list 1, and the pages the published root says were generated from a file of list 1 (`predictByProvenance`) |
 * | 3. the QA check | the built preview against the site published at the `gh-pages` ROOT (`measureSites`), sorted by `comparePrediction` into in-cone and NOT in the cone |
 *
 * ## Why a re-pin has to be expanded
 *
 * A change to a mounted layer reaches this site as a one-line edit to
 * `index.lock.json`, which predicts nothing on its own. So each mount whose
 * commit moved is diffed in its OWN repository between the two pins, and each
 * changed file is mapped through the lock's `directories` to the path it is
 * mounted at. A pin that cannot be diffed is said, never dropped.
 *
 * ## Why the QA diff compares the page BODY, with the base folded
 *
 * A preview is built under `/<repo>/STAGING/<slug>/` and main under `/<repo>/`,
 * and each stamps its own build into the chrome, so byte for byte every page
 * differs. In text files the preview's base is folded to main's, the
 * `BUILD_STAMPS` are blanked, and an HTML page is compared by its `<main>`
 * element when it has one. The page states this rule, because a difference
 * outside `<main>` is not reported.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/staging-changes.ts expand \
 *     --changed-files pr-files.txt --base-lock base.lock.json --head-lock index.lock.json \
 *     --out-list changed-expanded.txt --out-json sources.json [--out-impact rendered-impact.json]
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/staging-changes.ts render --sources sources.json \
 *     [--predicted rendered-impact.json] [--before pages-root | --before-git gh-pages-clone [--before-rev REV]] [--after _site \
 *      --staging-base /repo/STAGING/slug --site-base /repo --base <sha>] \
 *     --site-url https://o.github.io/repo/ --staging-url https://o.github.io/repo/STAGING/slug/ \
 *     --repo o/repo --head <sha> --branch <b> --slug <s> [--pr <n>] --out _site/changes
 *
 * ## The publish root as a directory, or as git objects
 *
 * `--before` is a checkout of the publish root. `--before-git` is a clone of
 * the publish branch that need hold no checkout and no blob
 * (`git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --no-checkout --branch gh-pages`):
 * the root's files are its tree (`--before-rev`, default `HEAD`), and the
 * page is the one `--before` gives for the same root ({@link measureGitRoot}).
 * A file that is not text is the same when its blob id is the preview file's,
 * so no binary blob is fetched. A text file is compared after the folding
 * above, which needs its bytes, so the root's text blobs are fetched in one
 * request — all of its HTML, which the provenance prediction reads, and any
 * other text file whose blob is not the preview's own bytes.
 *
 * @module cat-harness-tools/scripts/staging-changes
 * @covers none — it reports what a preview changed and judges no declared
 * graph; its logic is covered by `scripts/tests/sdlc/staging-changes.test.ts`
