/**
 * Every instance that declares a `themes` graph: does it load, and does each
 * theme in it validate?
 *
 * @module scripts/check-instance-themes
 * @covers themes
 *
 * ## Why this exists — bean `z6xd`
 *
 * `themes` read `state: "covered"` with three gates behind it, and **none of
 * the three resolved a themes directory.** `check-theme-art` reads
 * `readDeclaration` + `THEME_LAYOUTS`; `gen-themes-css` and
 * `render-theme-sheet` read `THEMES`. Those are the platform's own theme
 * constants and an instance's declared theme ART — and the who-iris
 * declaration is explicit that they are a different thing from its graph:
 *
 * > These are NOT the platform's twelve themes: those are cat-harness's own
 * > furniture, and a palette read off a WHO style guide is subject matter.
 *
 * So the kind was reported audited over ground nothing reached. I wrote one of
 * those three `@covers` lines myself, from the script's TITLE rather than its
 * scan set — the exact mistake the `@covers` work existed to prevent — and two
 * sibling sessions copied it. The three declarations are now `@covers none`
 * with their real subjects, and this is the gate that covers the graph.
 *
 * ## It asks the runtime's own question, and does not re-derive it
 *
 * `instanceThemes` in `schemas/theme-by-ref.ts` is what every generator
 * resolves a theme reference through. This calls it. A gate that re-derived
 * "which themes does this instance own" would be a second answer, free to
 * disagree with the one the pages are actually rendered from — which is the
 * defect this bean is about, one layer along.
 *
 * ## What it grades, and what it refuses to
 *
 * **Graded:** a declared themes directory whose module will not load, and a
 * theme that does not satisfy `ResolvedThemeSchema`. Both are broken
 * declarations with one repair.
 *
 * **Reported, never graded:** which KINDS an instance's themes carry. The
 * board styles a card only from `sticky` themes, and whether an instance
 * authors one is an authoring decision, not a defect: #1584 reserved it for
 * the owner, who answered it for who-iris on 2026-09-30 ("author iris-sticky",
 * bean `v8n5`) and for no other instance. So the kinds are printed with their
 * denominator and no verdict is attached. A check that failed on a missing
 * `sticky` would be answering a question its author was told not to.
 *
 * **Could-not-determine is never green** (bean `dh4f`): an instance whose
 * declaration will not load, or a themes module that throws, exits 2 rather
 * than being counted clean or skipped silently.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 report only, or `--check` with no blocking finding · 1
 * `--check` with one · 2 could not determine.
