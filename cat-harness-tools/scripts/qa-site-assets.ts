/**
 * qa-site-assets — the QA evidence a site build publishes, fetched from the
 * `qa-reports` branch and checked after it is copied, so the build knows what
 * it should have published and never passes a smaller set off as the whole.
 *
 * 1. **`fetch`**, before the docs generator. Reads the entry for this build's
 *    ref (`main/<sha>`, `pr/<n>/<sha>`) — and optional fallbacks — from
 *    `qa-reports` into a scratch directory, never into the checkout. Then:
 *    - an exact `main/<sha>` hit (index 0) holding a corpus: source `fetched`,
 *      materialised into the checkout's `test/results/` paths even when the
 *      checkout still holds a committed corpus, because `main/<sha>` is
 *      evidence about the exact tree being built;
 *    - otherwise, the checkout already holds the corpus: source `checkout`,
 *      and the expected counts are the checkout's;
 *    - it does not, and the fetch hit: the entry is MATERIALISED into the
 *      checkout's `test/results/` paths (`fetched`, or `fetched-fallback` when
 *      only a fallback ref hit — another commit's evidence, labelled as such);
 *    - neither: source `unavailable`. Stated, in the run log and in the
 *      published site — never a smaller set passed off as the whole.
 *    The state, with the counts the build must publish, goes to `--state`.
 * 2. **`verify`**, after the copy. Counts what landed in `_site/assets/qa/`
 *    against what the source held at fetch time, FAILS on a shortfall, and
 *    writes `_site/assets/qa/availability.json` saying which source the
 *    evidence came from — so the published site carries the answer too.
 *
 * ## Why the checkout wins on PR previews
 *
 * A PR's entry is published from the pull request's MERGE checkout, while a
 * staging preview builds the head, so the head's committed results describe
 * the tree the preview shows. On a `main` build an exact `main/<sha>` hit is
 * evidence about the very tree being built, so it wins over the checkout.
 *
 * ## A miss is never clean
 *
 * `unavailable` exits 0 by default — a docs deploy racing the job that
 * publishes its QA must not fail the site — but it is said three ways: a
 * `::warning` in the run, `availability.json` in the site, and the docs
 * generator's own "not available in this build" badges and `unknown` QA tile
 * (`qaCorpusAvailability`). `--require` makes it exit 1 for a caller that would
 * rather fail.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/qa-site-assets.ts fetch --ref <ref> [--fallback <ref>]... \
 *       --results <dir> [--state FILE] [--require]
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/qa-site-assets.ts verify --site <dir> --results <dir> [--state FILE]
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/qa-site-assets.ts tree-commits --site <dir> [--max N]
 *
 * 3. **`tree-commits`**, beside the copy. Writes `_site/assets/qa/tree-commits.json`:
 *    for each tree on main's own line of history (`git log --first-parent`,
 *    the newest `--max` commits, default 2000), the OLDEST commit carrying it,
 *    i.e. where that exact content first landed. QA verdicts record the tree
 *    they reviewed, not HEAD's commit (folio-assistant bean 69lr; owner card
 *    Q4, 2026-11-05: "the tree is the identity"), and the panel links a
 *    verdict's tree to that commit through this index (owner card Q5,
 *    2026-11-05, option 1: a separate index). Separate, because putting the
 *    commit into each witness would make the published pages depend on
 *    history again, so a PR run's pages could not be reused on main. A tree
 *    not in the history read (a shallow checkout, or a PR-only tree) is
 *    simply absent: the panel then shows the tree without a link. `repo` is
 *    the GitHub URL of `origin`, or `null` when there is none, so no link is
 *    built for another forge.
 *
 * Exit: 0 ok (or `unavailable`, stated) · 1 a shortfall, or `unavailable` under
 * `--require` · 2 usage, or `verify` with no fetch state to judge against.
