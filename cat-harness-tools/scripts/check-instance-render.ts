/**
 * Can this layer render its own JSON-LD, and does it publish what it owns?
 *
 * Rendering JSON-LD is a conformance requirement of every layer, including
 * one whose declaration names directories this repository does not have.
 *
 * ## Why "did it throw" is not the check
 *
 * **An export of nothing succeeds**: a reader resolving a directory against
 * the wrong root finds nothing and renders cleanly, and an export can publish
 * kinds the layer never declared. So this compares what the layer
 * DECLARES with what it PUBLISHES.
 *
 * ## Declared means transitively declared
 *
 * The layer declaration names a directory and the graph typologies in it;
 * a graph file inside that directory may name more. `beans/beans.json`
 * declares `bean-defs` and `workflow-state`, `todos/todos.json` declares
 * `todo-items` and `todo-feedback`. Those are the layer's, declared one
 * level down.
 *
 * ## Three states
 *
 * - **rendered** — it declared, it published, and everything it published is
 *   its own.
 * - **undetermined** — no declaration, or one that will not parse. NEVER a
 *   pass: a layer whose declaration cannot be read has not been shown to
 *   render, it has been shown to be unreadable. Exit 2.
 * - **failed** — the render threw, or it published nothing, or it published a
 *   kind it does not own. Exit 1.
 *
 * ## A layer that declares no directories renders nothing, and passes
 *
 * A layer may declare `directories: []` (e.g. an index that mounts none
 * of a repository's directories). Its render is then empty BY DECLARATION,
 * so it is **rendered**, flagged `noDirectories`, and reported as "declares
 * no directories" in the summary. The exemption is exactly the explicit
 * empty list: a layer that declares a directory and renders nothing
 * still fails, and so does one whose declaration leaves `directories` out.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat check:instance-render
 *   bun run cat check:instance-render -- --json
 *
 * @module scripts/check-instance-render
 * @covers docs, cat-harness
