/**
 * Does a bean's body name a parent its front matter does not carry?
 *
 * @module scripts/check-bean-parent-prose
 * @covers bean-defs
 *
 * ## Why — bean `tlj9`
 *
 * `4ccr`'s body said *"It belongs to the rendered-surface stream,
 * `folio-assistant-10uc`"* while its front matter carried **no `parent`**. Every
 * consumer that walks `parent` — a goal's open count, `beans roadmap`, a review's
 * queue — therefore omitted `4ccr` and its whole subtree from GOAL 2: **24 open
 * items**, including `ob3m`, the navbar findings that prompted the session which
 * found this. It surfaced only because somebody read the body.
 *
 * `check:bean-parents` already validates the DECLARED graph — that a parent
 * exists, that its type may parent, that an epic hangs from a milestone. This
 * asks a different question it cannot: **does the declaration agree with the
 * bean's own prose?**
 *
 * ## The phrase set is narrow ON PURPOSE, and the measurement says why
 *
 * Beans cross-reference each other constantly: **113 of 496 bodies name at
 * least one bean id, 337 mentions in total** (measured 2026-09-30). A detector
 * that treated any nearby id as a parent claim would fire on a fifth of the
 * store, and a check that cries wolf over 483 items is worse than the silence
 * it replaces.
 *
 * So the phrases below are the ones that ASSERT PLACEMENT — "belongs to",
 * "parent is", "should hang from", "parented to", "sits under" — each requiring
 * the id within about sixty characters. Over the whole store that set yields
 * **2 candidate sites**, not 337. That ratio is the reason to trust it, and the
 * reason `tlj9` scoped it to one phrasing family rather than to prose in
 * general: a detector recognising one form and calling the corpus clean is the
 * `vq8g` defect, and the honest answer to that is a stated scope, not a wider
 * net.
 *
 * ## Quotations are skipped, because one of the two hits was a quotation
 *
 * `tlj9`'s own body QUOTES `4ccr`'s sentence as evidence, inside a blockquote.
 * Reading that as a claim would make the bean that reports the defect a
 * reporter of itself. Blockquote lines and fenced code are skipped, which takes
 * the candidate set from 2 to 1 — and the one that remains is real.
 *
 * ## Could-not-determine is never green (bean `dh4f`)
 *
 * No bean store, or a body that cannot be read, exits 2. A store this cannot
 * open is not a store with no drift.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 report only, or `--check` with no finding · 1 `--check` with
 * one · 2 could not determine.
 */
/**
 * `readBeans` is the ONE reader of the store, and this uses it rather than
 * walking `beans/defs/` itself.
 *
 * `check-bean-parents.ts` records why in its own import comment: every other
 * script had grown its own front-matter parser and its own `beanDefsDir`, so a
 * bean's `parent` had as many readings as there were callers. `BeanNode` already
 * carries `id`, `parent` AND `body`, which is everything this check needs — and
 * `beansIn` is deliberately non-recursive, so `beans/defs/archive/` (631
 * terminal beans with its own declaration and its own reader) does not fold
 * into this count. Re-globbing the directory here would have picked it up.
