/**
 * The LSI indexes as repository HEALTH: which declared prose graphs need an
 * index and lack a fresh one, and what each stored index found.
 *
 * @module cat-harness-tools/scripts/lsi-health
 *
 * This was the body of the LSI viewer page until cat-harness#1144. The owner
 * (2026-11-08): the page was a health report, and a health report belongs in
 * the existing repository health report (`bun run cat health`); the page
 * itself became the Indexing evidence page (`gen-lsi-viz.ts`). So the reads
 * moved here unchanged, and `test/health/checks.ts` draws the `lsi-indexes`
 * check from {@link lsiHealthEvidence}.
 *
 * ## The checkout first, then the store by ref, and a miss is never an answer
 *
 * Bean `oq1j` (arc `3fva`, reader `R14`). With `test/results/lsi/` in the
 * checkout the indexes are read from there. Without it, they are on the
 * `qa-reports` branch, and {@link readIndexes} reads them by ref through
 * `qa-store`, together with the run records the freshness verdict needs.
 * Anything but a hit is returned AS the answer: an absent directory must not
 * read as "no index is missing".
 *
 * It does not recompute the indexes, as `lsi:skills:check` does: freshness is
 * a question about the store, and recomputing an index would make it fresh by
 * construction.
