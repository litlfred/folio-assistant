/**
 * qa-refresh — produce the QA working copy that `qa-publish` stores, and say
 * whether it is complete.
 *
 * `qa:publish` stores whatever the checkout holds under the declared `qa`
 * directories. Where `test/results/` is not committed, a fresh CI checkout
 * holds almost nothing there, so the writers must run before publishing.
 *
 * ## The publish job runs the writers
 *
 * Every gate over the `qa` graph is in JUDGE mode: it computes, judges and
 * **writes nothing** (`gates.ts`' tree guard reports a read-only gate that
 * writes), so the gates job has no working copy to hand over. Making gates
 * write would put the writers on the critical path of every PR and of every
 * local `bun run cat gates`. So the writers run here, in `qa-publish`, which
 * is not a gate and runs after the gates whatever they concluded — the same
 * commit and the same producers, so what it stores is what the gates judged,
 * recomputed.
 *
 * ## The writers are DECLARED, and the declaration is checked on every run
 *
 * {@link QA_WRITERS} says which command writes which part of the tree. After
 * every computed run, over the real tree:
 *
 * - a file **no** writer claims is `unclaimed`: something wrote where the
 *   declaration does not look, and the record's provenance is unknown;
 * - a writer whose families hold **no** file is `empty`: it ran and produced
 *   nothing, or did not run;
 * - a writer that exits outside its `okExits` is `failed`.
 *
 * Any of the three makes the run INCOMPLETE (exit 1), and `qa:publish
 * --completeness` refuses an incomplete report. A partial entry is never
 * stored as if it were whole.
 *
 * ## Modes, decided per writer
 *
 * Each writer is decided ON ITS OWN DECLARED PATHS, so one family can be
 * untracked while others stay tracked:
 *
 * - **tracked** — every writer's declared paths are still tracked. Nothing is
 *   run: the commit's own copy IS the record, and `main/<sha>` must be
 *   byte-identical to it (`qa:verify-moved`).
 * - **computed** — nothing is tracked there. Every writer runs, in order,
 *   into the working copy.
 * - **mixed** — some writers' paths are tracked and some are not. Unbacked, a
 *   writer runs; backed, the commit's copy is its record and it does not.
 *
 * In `mixed`, `empty` and `failed` are judged over EVERY writer (a backed
 * writer's family holding no file means the commit's copy is missing it), but
 * `unclaimed` only over files NOT tracked: a tracked file's provenance is the
 * commit that carries it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat qa:refresh [--report FILE] [--json]   # run (computed) or account (tracked); write the report
 *   bun run cat qa:refresh --github --report FILE     # CI: skip, with a notice, where qa:publish would skip
 *   bun run cat qa:refresh --list                     # the declared writers, in order; runs nothing
 *
 * Exit: 0 complete · 1 incomplete · 2 could not determine (no declaration, not a checkout).
 *
