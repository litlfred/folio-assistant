/**
 * Post-merge regeneration check and automated repair PR pipeline.
 *
 * @module scripts/post-merge-regen
 * @graphNode none — SDLC maintenance and repair automation
 *
 * `.github/workflows/merge-main.yml` runs `bun run cat merge:main` on an opted-in
 * PR branch when `main` moves, but nothing regenerates `main` after a PR
 * merges into it, so a merge that changes an enumerated or counted directory
 * can leave `main` red (e.g. `readme:subgraphs:check` counting files in
 * `uploads/`). This detects that and opens a repair.
 *
 * ## Principles
 *
 * 1. Detected and ACTED on: main going stale on a derived artefact is detected
 *    and an automated repair action is generated.
 * 2. Reviewable PR, never direct push to main, so the repair cannot bypass CI
 *    gates.
 * 3. NEGATIVE CONTROL: a merge that changes nothing counted triggers 0 repairs
 *    and opens NO repair PR.
 * 4. Honest reporting: if a check has no writer or its writer fails, it is
 *    reported as unrepaired/defect (exit 1), not claimed as a repair.
 * 5. A `builtAtPublish` output is never stale:
 *    a check whose writer moved only paths an instance declares it builds at
 *    publish is reported in `builtAtPublishChecks`, not as stale or repaired.
 *    Those paths are gitignored, so no repair of them could ever land.
