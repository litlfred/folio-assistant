/**
 * `structure.json` is named in code only by its accessor.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-structure-accessor
 * @covers library
 *
 * `structure.json` has two variants, `pdf-structure/v1` and
 * `notebook-structure/v1`, read through one accessor
 * (`schemas/content/document-structure.ts`: `readStructure`, `structureOf`). A
 * reader that builds the path itself learns one variant and misreads the
 * other. So the quoted token `"structure.json"` on a CODE line is refused
 * outside the accessor and a short allowlist, each entry carrying its reason:
 * {@link ALLOWED} for this layer and below, and each instance's own
 * `gateExemptions.files` for its files. Use `STRUCTURE_FILENAME` and
 * `readStructure`.
 *
 * Matched: the exact quoted token — `"structure.json"` or `'structure.json'`
 * — on a line that is not a comment. Prose (a longer message, a doc comment)
 * is not matched. Test files are exempt.
 *
 * An unlisted file is a failure, and so is a STALE entry (an allowlisted file
 * that no longer contains the token).
 *
 * Exit: 0 clean, 1 a finding, 2 could not list the corpus (never a pass).
