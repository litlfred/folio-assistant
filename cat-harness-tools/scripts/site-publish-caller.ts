/**
 * Every harnessed repository publishes its site, and refreshes its QA
 * reports, on every push to main, through the ONE shared workflow, and its
 * caller of that workflow is the canonical one.
 *
 * @module scripts/site-publish-caller
 * @covers cat-harness — the instance axis: a harnessed repository's `.github/workflows/` carries the canonical caller of `folio-site-publish.yml`
 *
 * Owner, 2026-11-11: *"i want that it publishes once merge to main, update QA
 * reports etc."* (cat-harness-tools#1879). The shared workflow is
 * `.github/workflows/folio-site-publish.yml`. The canonical caller is
 * `templates/document/github/workflows/site-publish.yml`, which is read from
 * this layer's own copy and never restated here. A repository is judged when
 * it has an `index.config.json` (it is harnessed). A finding is any of these:
 *
 * | the repository | why it is wrong |
 * |---|---|
 * | calls `folio-site-publish.yml` from no workflow | it never publishes on a merge |
 * | calls it from more than one workflow | two publishes race for gh-pages |
 * | has a caller that differs from the template other than in comments and the pinned commit | e.g. a manual-only trigger, a `paths` filter, other inputs, an extra job |
 * | has a caller pinned to a branch or tag | `check:workflow-pins` moves it to the lock's commit |
 * | runs `stage-local.ts` in a workflow step of its own | a hand-rolled copy of the shared steps (the old IG template) |
 *
 * WHICH commit the caller is pinned to is `check:workflow-pins`' question,
 * not this one's: here any 40-hex commit is accepted.
 *
 *   bun run cat check:site-publish-caller          # judge this checkout
 *   bun run cat site-publish-caller --write        # write the canonical caller (then: bun run cat workflow-pins)
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 canonical, or not a harnessed repository · 1 a finding · 2 the template is unreadable.
