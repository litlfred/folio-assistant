/**
 * The CI cone. A pull request's CI skips a check whose inputs are unchanged
 * since main's last green run.
 *
 * @module scripts/ci-cone
 * @graphNode none — a CI helper behind `gate-shell.sh`, not a gate itself
 *
 * A check's inputs are declared or DERIVED, never inferred. Declared inputs
 * of `{tracked}` (the whole tree) move on every PR, so this adds the derived
 * read set, computed from the run itself and never stored as authored data:
 *
 * 1. **Record (a push to main).** Every candidate check runs under
 *    `strace -f`. The files, directories and absent paths that run touched
 *    inside the checkout are its read set. They are recorded with the state of
 *    each one and the check's input fingerprint (script closure, audited
 *    environment, tool versions and `--against` baseline, but not the tree),
 *    in `build/ci-cone/records.json`. The workflow caches that file under
 *    main's sha.
 * 2. **Decide (a pull request).** The PR restores the record of its nearest
 *    main ancestor, re-computes the fingerprint and the state of every
 *    recorded path, and skips only on an exact match, saying
 *    `SKIPPED — inputs unchanged since <sha>`, never "passed".
 *
 * ## Wiring
 *
 * `gate-shell.sh` uses it once a gate job restores `build/ci-cone` (key
 * `ci-cone-v1-<job>-<base sha>`, restore-keys `ci-cone-v1-<job>-`), runs
 * `prepare`, and saves on a green push to main. `layer-pr-checks.yml` uses it
 * without `gate-shell.sh`: `.github/scripts/layer-pr-checks/run-gates.py`
 * asks {@link decideAll} once per shard (`decide-all`), records a cone skip
 * as SKIPPED with its sha (never an exit code), and on a push to the caller's
 * main runs each candidate that did not skip through `run`.
 *
 * ## Why an exact match is enough
 *
 * The verdict and its read set R come from the same run. A PR run with the
 * same code (the fingerprint hashes the import closure) and the same content
 * at every path in R starts in the same state; the input-site audit
 * (`input-sites.ts`) hashes or refuses every other input (environment, clock,
 * network, git history). So it reads the same R and gives the same answer.
 *
 * "The same code" is the static import closure, which the fingerprint hashes,
 * and every module the run loaded by a computed `import()` / `require()`,
 * which is in R: the run opened it. Which modules a computed load reaches is
 * decided by code and data the run read, so a module it did not load cannot
 * change its answer, and the fingerprint does not hash it (bean vgfp). The
 * audit still walks every module the declarations could name.
 *
 * A trace covers only the path that run took, so a run whose reads cannot be
 * enumerated is recorded as undetermined and always runs:
 * - a write inside the checkout;
 * - a relative path whose directory the trace does not name;
 * - a syscall this parser does not classify;
 * - more than {@link MAX_PATHS} paths;
 * - a `tree` site (git's view of the tree, refused for any input set
 *   narrower than `{tracked}`);
 * - a `traced` input site the run reached.
 *
 * ## Left out of a read set
 *
 * - **Paths outside the checkout** (system libraries, `/tmp`, the bun install
 *   cache): the environment, covered by the hashed versions and variables.
 * - **The top-level `node_modules/`**: pinned by `bun.lock`, which every
 *   fingerprint hashes, and CI installs with `--frozen-lockfile`. A NESTED
 *   `node_modules` is read like any other directory.
 * - **`.git/` read by a `git` process**: an audited input site (`head`,
 *   `refs`) or refused (`tree`). The script's own reads of `.git` are kept.
 * - **This module's own directory and the input-hash cache.**
 *
 * A directory the run only opened, stat'ed or resolved names inside, and never
 * listed (`getdents64`), has the state {@link OPENED_DIR}; only a directory
 * whose entries the run read keeps its sorted entry listing.
