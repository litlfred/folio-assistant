/**
 * The archive is a DECLARED view, and everything in it is terminal.
 *
 * Bean `e8m3`, and the owner's ruling of 2026-09-26: archiving is a **view**,
 * not a terminal state. An archived bean keeps its status and is still part of
 * the store. Two things follow, and neither held when this was written.
 *
 * ## 1. The directory was not declared, and no existing check could see that
 *
 * `beans/beans.json` declared `defs` and `workflows` and nothing else, while
 * `beans/defs/archive/` held **631 bean-defs** — the larger half of the store.
 * That is the `dh4f` family INVERTED: not a declared directory that is absent,
 * but a present one nothing declares. `check:declared-dirs` and
 * `check:harness-dirs` both compare declarations against disk, so a directory
 * missing from the declaration is invisible to them by construction. The gap is
 * structural rather than an oversight, which is why it needs its own check
 * rather than a wider glob somewhere else.
 *
 * ## 2. An archived bean that is still open is work nobody can see
 *
 * This is the invariant the ruling implies, and the defect `e8m3` was filed
 * over. Measured 2026-09-25: in one five-day window 131 beans left the top
 * level, and **35 of them were `todo` or `in-progress`** — gone from the active
 * store without a terminal status and, because archiving is a file move rather
 * than a status change, without a recorded reason. Every count this repository
 * quotes reads the active store only, so none of them could fall when that
 * happened. A number that drops when work FINISHES but not when it is set aside
 * is not measuring what its name says.
 *
 * Those 35 were triaged before this check existed — measured 2026-09-26, all
 * 631 archived beans are terminal. So this ships GREEN, and that is the point:
 * it is the guard that makes the recurrence impossible to have silently, not a
 * report of a present mess. A check written only when it can fail is a check
 * that exists because somebody was already in trouble.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It does not hold archived beans to `check:bean-parents`, `bean-rollup` or
 * `bean-blocks`. Those are about work in front of somebody; 631 historical
 * beans were never held to today's conventions, and turning them all into
 * findings would be a red nobody can act on — which is how a gate gets
 * switched off. Terminality is the one property the VIEW ruling actually
 * requires.
 *
 * Exit: 0 declared and all terminal, 1 undeclared or a non-terminal bean,
 * 2 COULD NOT DETERMINE (declared and absent).
