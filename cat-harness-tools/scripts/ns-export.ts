/**
 * The folio namespace, as a document that dereferences.
 *
 * `FOLIO_NS` is `https://litlfred.github.io/folio-assistant/ns/` and every
 * class and property the graph projects hangs off it. This serves that stem,
 * so a consumer holding only the JSON-LD can resolve any term it meets; CI
 * also uses it to assert every minted term is defined.
 *
 * ## One node per term
 *
 * Each term gets an `@id`, a type, a label and a definition — which is what
 * makes `folio:Actor` resolvable rather than merely mentioned.
 *
 * ## Where each definition comes from
 *
 * Graph typologies are read from `BASE_GRAPH_TYPOLOGIES`, which already carries a
 * `summary` for each; they are not restated in `schemas/content/vocabulary.ts`.
 * Everything else is glossed in `vocabulary.ts`. A term
 * defined in both is an error, not a preference.
 *
 * Usage:  bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/ns-export.ts [--out FILE] [--check]
 *
 * `--check` writes nothing and exits non-zero if any minted term has no
 * definition, naming each one.
 *
 * @module scripts/ns-export

/**
 * Why `--layer <value>` was refused, or `undefined` when it is a layer.
 *
 * ONE READ OF `TERM_LAYERS` DECIDES BOTH the verdict and the sentence, which
 * is the whole point (#807). It was two literals — a predicate listing
 * `cat-bootstrap` and a message already saying `bootstrap` — so a refusal
 * printed the value it had just refused and read as an impossible state.
 *
 * Exported rather than left inline in the `import.meta.main` block because a
 * branch inside that block cannot be reached by a test at all: the only way to
 * exercise it was to spawn the script and read stderr, which is why nothing
 * did, and why the drift sat there through a rename.
