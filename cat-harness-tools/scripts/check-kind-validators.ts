 * Every graph typology that declares a validator — does it actually load?

 * 1. **A declared validator that does not resolve** — a wrong path, a missing
 *    export, or a module that exports an interface rather than a Zod schema.
 *    Fails.

 * @module folio-assistant/scripts/check-kind-validators
 * @covers validators, block-kinds, content-adapters, qa-checkers, pipeline-plugins, computed — every
 *   block kind's adapter must name a `content-adapters/` node, and an untyped vocabulary's module must exist; every
 *   `qa-checkers` and `pipeline-plugins` node is loaded through the platform root's dependency
 *   tree and must resolve to the code its table ref names; every discovered block kind is checked against
 *   the kinds BlockSchema types, both directions; every `folio-validator/v1` node is parsed, resolved and
 *   joined onto a kind (one naming no kind is a finding), which is fixed coverage of the
 *   `validators` graph; the KINDS it sweeps are whichever declare `nodeSchemas`, so that half
