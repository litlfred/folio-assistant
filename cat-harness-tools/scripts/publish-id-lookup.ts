/**
 * Publish the identifier lookup into a BUILT site: the client page and every
 * declared instance's index, under `<site>/id-lookup/`. Issue #1972 step 3,
 * bean `1br0`.
 *
 * ## Why here, and why after the build
 *
 * The owner's ruling on bean `4pm8` (2026-09-25): title search over
 * referenced nodes is an accepted gap, and IDENTIFIER lookup is carried by the
 * prefix-sharded lookup. The lookup client is JavaScript and says of itself
 * that it "never sits under the plain docs pipeline" — so it is not added to
 * the Jekyll source. It is copied into the built tree after Jekyll, the way
 * the KG viewer is emitted, and the site's search box links to it (the
 * owner's choice of 2026-10-03: a separate page and a link).
 *
 * Layout, which is what `search-split.ts` detects to name each index as a
 * `remote` scope in the search manifest:
 *
 *   <site>/id-lookup/index.html, lookup.js        the client (`?index=<source>/`)
 *   <site>/id-lookup/<source>/manifest.json, ...  one directory per instance
 *
 * Each index is copied byte for byte from the instance's own declared
 * `id-lookup` directory — `gen-id-lookup.ts` writes it and `id-lookup:check`
 * gates it — minus that directory's generated README, which is a repository
 * file and not part of the index.
 *
 * Usage: bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/publish-id-lookup.ts --site <built site>
 *
 * @module cat-harness-tools/scripts/publish-id-lookup
