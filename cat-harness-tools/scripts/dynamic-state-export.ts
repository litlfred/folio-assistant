/**
 * Render stage 3 (`kg-dynamic`): publish the running workflows' state as
 * JSON-LD at `<site>/<harness>/state.jsonld`. The workflow pages read this
 * file when they load.
 *
 * It is a different document from the stage-1 graph export: a different
 * name, `type: cat-harness:DynamicState` and `$schema:
 * cat-harness-dynamic-state/v1`, holding only instances, positions and stuck
 * states. Built by the same readers the workflow pages use
 * (`dynamicStateInputs`), so the two never disagree about which instances
 * exist.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/dynamic-state-export.ts [--site <dir>] [--out <file>]
 *
 * A store that could not be read (a checkout without its bean branch) is
 * named in `unreadStores`, so its instances read as unknown, never as none.
