/**
 * Report on this instance's theme art — the intake check, run over what shipped.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-theme-art
 * @covers none — its subject is an instance's declared theme ART, read from
 * the declaration's `images` via `readDeclaration` and grouped by
 * `THEME_LAYOUTS`. It resolves NO `themes` directory, and it declared
 * `@covers themes` until 2026-09-30 (bean `z6xd`), which reported the graph
 * audited over ground this script never reaches. `check:instance-themes`
 * covers the graph.
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20: *"make skills for avatar theme ingestion (need 3
 * meeting certain formatting constraints), return sucches or explnation of
 * falire"*, scoped by *"make as part of docuemtn ingestion skill...."*
 *
 * `schemas/theme-art-intake.ts` is the check itself and is pure. This is its CLI
 * face: it reads the instance's declaration, groups the declared images by role,
 * and runs intake over each group.
 *
 * ## Why this reported before it gated
 *
 * It used to refuse `landing-architecture`, which was declared with laptop and
 * card and **no mobile**. That was a real finding, and exactly the failure
 * intake exists to catch — but turning it into a gate in the same change would
 * have made CI red over art that was missing rather than over a regression
 * somebody had just introduced. All three layouts are accepted as of
 * 2026-09-30 (`bun run check:theme-art:check`, exit 0, 3 layouts each), so the
 * reason to hold the gate is gone and the gate is in.
 *
 * So: `--check` exits non-zero on a refusal. **It has been gated in CI since
 * 2026-09-24** — `code-quality-gates.yml` runs `check:theme-art:check`, and
 * that step's own comment records why: `landing-architecture` had no mobile
 * crop, the owner supplied it, so a refusal here is now a regression rather
 * than a backlog item.
 *
 * This paragraph said the opposite until 2026-09-30 (bean `q885`), and a stale
 * gap notice is worse than none: an agent reading "nothing runs `--check` in
 * CI" concludes the guard is advisory and either weakens it or stops trusting
 * it, where the same agent reading the true state would have left it alone.
 * `check:navbar-consistency` is the check for this class of claim.
 *
 * The same discipline the repository already applies elsewhere: **a report is
 * not an action**, and an agent does not repair somebody's art on its own
 * initiative.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 report only, or `--check` with no refusals · 1 `--check` with a
 * refusal.
