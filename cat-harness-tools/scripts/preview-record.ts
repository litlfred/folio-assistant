/**
 * preview-record — what a preview build produced, written so a second build of
 * the same tree can be checked against it, file for file.
 *
 * @module scripts/preview-record
 * @covers none — a PUBLISHER step: it hashes one built site and compares two
 * hashings; it judges no graph and no content
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/preview-record.ts write   --site _site --repo . --slug <slug> --builder agent|ci [--base <sha>] [--run <url>]
 * bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/preview-record.ts match   --record <file> --repo . [--tree <sha>]
 * bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/preview-record.ts compare --claimed <file> --rebuilt <file> [--slug <slug>] [--run <url>] [--out <file>]
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why (owner, 2026-11-01, Q-SPD-9 B and Q-SPD-9b A; folio-assistant#2881)
 *
 * An agent's session has the checkout and the tools in hand, so it can build
 * a preview itself and put it live at once, instead of waiting 25 to 50
 * minutes for a runner. The owner chose that for PREVIEWS ONLY (main and
 * release stay CI-built), checked by a FULL rebuild in CI afterwards, off the
 * critical path, rather than by a random sample: *"why random sample? what is
 * the intent?"*. A full rebuild is a complete check, with nothing left to
 * chance.
 *
 * ## What a record holds
 *
 * - `tree`: the git TREE the site was built from (`HEAD^{tree}`). A preview is
 *   the branch merged into its base, and a clean merge of the same two commits
 *   gives the same tree, so this is the one exact identity of "the same
 *   input". The head and base commits are kept beside it to rebuild from.
 * - `lock`: the sha256 of `index.lock.json`, so a re-pin is a different input
 *   even when someone hand-edits around it. (The tree already covers it; the
 *   field makes a mismatch readable.)
 * - `files`: every file of the built site, path to sha256, before
 *   `staging-share` prunes it. HTML is hashed after the per-preview edits
 *   are set aside ({@link normalisePreviewHtml}), so the record says the same
 *   thing whoever built it.
 * - `digest`: one sha256 over the sorted `path NUL hash` lines.
 *
 * ## What is never compared, and why it is a fixed list
 *
 * {@link BUILD_FACTS}: the files that describe a BUILD rather than its
 * output (when, by whom, from which run). They differ between any two builds
 * by design. The list lives here, in code a reviewer reads, and not in the
 * record, so a builder cannot widen it for itself.
 *
 * Any other difference counts. When a writer turns out to stamp a time or a
 * run into its output, the fix is to make that writer reproducible, not to
 * add its file here: a file left out of the check is a file an agent build
 * could get wrong unseen.
