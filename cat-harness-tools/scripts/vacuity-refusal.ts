/**
 * A gate that examined NOTHING must refuse, not pass: an empty corpus makes
 * every count zero, and zero reads as a clean run.
 *
 * ## Why a module rather than a few lines in each gate
 *
 * A per-gate convention is applied only by an author who already knows about
 * it. A shared function makes the correct behaviour cheaper to reach than the
 * incorrect one, and gives the cross-gate reader a single shape to consume.
 *
 * ## Why the message names every source and its state
 *
 * "0 files validated" does not say whether a directory is missing,
 * present-and-empty, or present with nothing matching the filter, and those are
 * three different repairs: a wrong path, an empty instance, a filter that has
 * stopped matching what the corpus is named. Reporting the state per source
 * turns a refusal into an action.
 *
 * ## Why exit 2 rather than 1
 *
 * 1 is "determined, and it is wrong". 2 is "could not determine": a run that
 * examined nothing has not established that there are no errors. Same split
 * `check:bun-pin` and `check:red-gate-is-last` use for a scan that matched no
 * site.
 *
 * @covers none — a shared helper, not an audit of any declared graph typology
 * @graphNode tool
