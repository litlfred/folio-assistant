/**
 * check:instance-graph — every instance's dependency graph resolves: no
 * missing dependency, no cycle. Bean `a1lq`.
 *
 * The owner's ruling, 2026-09-23: at runtime a missing dependency WARNS and
 * the overlay continues without that layer, because an uncloned git-URL
 * dependency in a partial checkout looks exactly like one, and throwing there
 * stops sessions that work. That leniency is safe only if something fails on
 * it where it matters, and this is that something: in CI the checkout is
 * whole, so a dependency that is missing here is misspelled or gone.
 *
 * A cycle already throws at runtime (`orderedDependencies`); it is reported
 * here as well, so one run names every broken instance rather than the first.
 *
 * ## Declared, and identified (issue #1548)
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-30: *"QA gates on harness declaration of dependences. harness
 * instancess need IRI for harness."* Two more obligations, gated here:
 *
 * - **Every instance DECLARES `needs`.** Absent is undetermined, and at
 *   runtime it stays a legal third state (`resolution-across-needs.test.ts`
 *   proves what it reports), but in this repository it is a finding. `[]`
 *   declares the floor and is fine. Until this gate, #1508 had made all
 *   instances comply by hand and nothing held them there.
 * - **Every instance has an absolute harness IRI, and no two share one.** The
 *   IRI is `kg-export`'s own `exportIdentity(...).canonicalIri`, called rather
 *   than re-derived, so this gate and the published `@id` cannot disagree.
 *
