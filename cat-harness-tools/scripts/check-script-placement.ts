/**
 * Does every script live in the manifest of the layer it runs?
 *
 * Bean `ar1s` phase 4 split the root `package.json`'s 509 scripts by layer
 * (`cat-harness/schemas/script-table.ts`). A script whose command names one
 * layer's paths belongs to that layer; one naming several belongs to the one
 * that needs all the others (its declared `needs`, transitively); one naming
 * none, or naming layers no single one needs, belongs to the root, the
 * aggregate. Without this check the next added script lands in the root out of
 * habit, and the table drifts back to the one file a split cannot divide.
 *
 * The layers and their order are READ from each instance's declaration, never
 * listed here. A submodule (another repository's checkout) is not a layer of
 * this one: a script running its code stays at the root.
 *
 *   bun run cat check:script-placement
 *
 * @covers none — it places scripts by the paths their commands name; it judges no graph
