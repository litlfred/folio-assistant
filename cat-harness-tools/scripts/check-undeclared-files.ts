 * 2. **a declared directory** of any instance, resolved at repository scope
 *    (`beans/`, `todos/` and friends live at the root by declaration);
 * 3. **repository infrastructure** — {@link ROOT_INFRASTRUCTURE}, a list with
 *    a reason per entry;
 * 4. **git's own business** — dotfiles, `node_modules/`, ignored paths.
 *
 * Anything else is reported. The report is a **finding, not an action**:
 * `deletion-requires-confirmation` governs what happens next.
