/**
 * No declared directory sits inside another declared directory.
 *
 * An instance's assets live at `<stub>/<asset>` — `cat-harness/skills/`,
 * `<content>/library/`, `<ig>/methodologies/`. A root declaration reaching
 * down a multi-level path is not allowed. Nesting declared from within (a
 * sub-graph node in the first subdirectory labelling the ones inside it) is
 * allowed but not yet recognised here; when that node kind exists, this check
 * must stop reporting the nestings it describes.
 *
 * A pair is also not a finding when one of the child's typologies declares
 * `within` equal to one of the parent directory's typologies (e.g.
 * `library/<entry>/l1-extraction/` with a typology `within: "library"`). The
 * rule reads the typology registry, never a kind name, the same reading
 * `lib/library-entry-graphs.ts` makes to publish that directory.
 *
 * The test is containment, not depth: `<content>/library/` is two segments
 * deep and fine. The containment relation comes from `subgraphTree`; this
 * check computes no geometry of its own.
 *
 * Enforcement is a RATCHET: known pairs sit in a committed baseline and
 * anything not in it fails. Removing a pair prints as fixed, not a failure;
 * `--update` rewrites the baseline.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat check:layout-norms
 *   bun run cat check:layout-norms -- --update    # rewrite the baseline
 *   bun run cat check:layout-norms -- --json      # sidecar only
 *   bun run cat check:layout-norms:check          # JUDGE: compute and judge, write nothing (the gate)
 *
 * Exit: 0 clean (or only known pairs), 1 a pair not in the baseline,
 *       2 could not determine. Judge mode (`--check`) keeps the
 *       same table and adds 2 for an unknown flag or a run that threw.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-layout-norms
 * @covers cat-harness
