/**
 * Run bootstrap-tools' standalone rehearsal when bootstrap arrives by remote
 * mount from lock.
 *
 * `rehearse-standalone.ts` tests that bootstrap-tools passes its checks when
 * isolated beside bootstrap in an empty scratch directory, and asks
 * `gitFiles()` which files a standalone clone would hold. Remote-mounted
 * bootstrap and bootstrap-tools are ignored by the enclosing repository's
 * `.gitignore` and `.git/info/exclude`, so `git ls-files` inside them returns
 * zero files.
 *
 * ## It works on COPIES, never on the mounts
 *
 * The gates run concurrently over one tree, and no gate may change it: a
 * `.git` inside a mount makes `instanceRootsIn` (cat-harness
 * `schemas/kg/instance-roots.ts`) drop it as a foreign checkout, and
 * `closureOf` (`seed-ready.ts`) then skips the missing need silently.
 *
 * So bootstrap and bootstrap-tools are copied (without `.git` and
 * `node_modules`) into a fresh temporary directory, the COPIES are given git
 * metadata, the root `node_modules` is linked beside them, and the copy's own
 * rehearsal runs there. Nothing is written into a mount, and the directory is
 * removed afterwards.
 *
 * @module scripts/rehearse-bootstrap-standalone
 * @covers code — bootstrap-tools standalone rehearsal across remote-mounted bootstrap
