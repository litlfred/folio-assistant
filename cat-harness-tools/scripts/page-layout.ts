/**
 * The PAGE LAYOUT — one stylesheet and one small script that give every
 * standalone page beside the rail the same width, top bar and scrolling.
 *
 * @module scripts/page-layout
 *
 * Standalone pages come from generators in several layers. The layout rules
 * know nothing of FHIR or of any IG, so they live HERE, the lowest layer that
 * writes standalone pages ({@link thinPageHtml} is this layer's), and the
 * layers above link this one file instead of keeping copies.
 *
 * ## What it is, matching folio-assistant's own pages
 *
 * - FULL WIDTH: the content fills from the rail's edge to the window's
 *   (`docs-ui.css`, "Full-width content on wide screens": `.main{max-width:none}`).
 * - ONE SCROLLER, THE WINDOW, under a STICKY BAR: folio-assistant's band is
 *   `position: sticky` at the top of the content column, the Folio tab sits
 *   on it, and text scrolls under it (`docs-ui.css` `.fa-glass-band[data-fa-band-tools]`).
 *   Here the page's own bar is that band, so the bare strip
 *   docs-ui draws behind the tab on a scrolled page is not drawn. Below
 *   50rem the bar scrolls away, so a phone keeps its screen.
 * - ANCHORS BELOW THE BAR: `scroll-padding-top`, from the bar's measured
 *   height, as folio-assistant pads for its band.
 * - The rail is unchanged: fixed at the left, its middle its own scroller
 *   (`navbar.css`, already one shared file).
 *
 * For a page drawn from JSON after load, the script restores what a static
 * page gets from the browser: a `#hash` scrolled to when its target is drawn,
 * and back/forward/reload returning to where the reader was.
 *
 * ## The contract is markup, so nothing changes by accident
 *
 * A page opts in by its classes: {@link PAGE_BAR_CLASS} on its top bar,
 * {@link PAGE_MAIN_CLASS} on its content column, {@link PAGE_FOOT_CLASS} on a
 * footer, {@link PAGE_WIDE_TABLE_CLASS} on a table that should fill the
 * column (any other table in the column scrolls inside its own box). A page with none of them that links the file is unchanged but for
 * `body{margin:0}`. The bar's colours are the page's: `--fa-page-bar-bg` and
 * `--fa-page-bar-fg`.
