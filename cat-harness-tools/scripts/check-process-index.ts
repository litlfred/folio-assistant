/**
 * The workflow page's process table covers every declared BPMN — read from the
 * published named-subgraph JSON-LD, the only store it has.
 *
 * The page walks `docs/subgraph/index.jsonld` down to every `processes`
 * subgraph's `index.hydrated.jsonld`; this gate checks the same files:
 *
 *   1. the repository index, every harness root and every `processes`
 *      subgraph it reaches exist and validate against `schemas/kg/subgraph-manifest.ts`;
 *   2. every `.bpmn` a layer in this graph's corpus declares has a
 *      `Process` node there — recomputed from the declarations, so the
 *      published files cannot vouch for themselves;
 *   3. every such node carries its diagram's documentation (`summary`), and
 *      a `depiction` names an SVG that is there;
 *   4. no node names a diagram that is not declared;
 *   5. the page still carries the container the view mounts on, with a
 *      `<noscript>` fallback.
 *
 * ## Diagrams of instances this graph does not frame
 *
 * Lower layers (`bootstrap`, `bootstrap-tools`) publish their own subgraphs
 * at their own sites, linked from the repository index with `seeAlso`. Such a
 * diagram is covered when that link is there AND bootstrap-tools'
 * `buildSubgraphs` (run here in process, nothing fetched) holds a documented
 * Process node for it, keyed by its `source` IRI. An unframed layer with
 * no such link is LISTED as not covered, with the reason, never folded into a
 * clean total. Which layers are unframed is computed (`framedInstances`).
 *
 * Staleness (the files differ from what the generator writes now) is
 * `subgraph:jsonld:check`'s, not this gate's.
 *
 * Usage:  bun run cat check:process-index
 * Exit:   0 covered (with any out-of-graph diagrams listed) · 1 a covered
 *         layer's diagram is missing or undocumented, a node is stale, or
 *         the page lost its mount
 *
 * @covers processes, docs
