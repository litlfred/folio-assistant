/**
 * Register a declared set of tool groups, wherever they are declared.
 *
 * @module src/tool-groups
 *
 * ## Why the mechanism is here and there is no list
 *
 * Two servers register tool groups — the viewer server in
 * `adapters/mcp-server/` and the HTTP/stdio server in `src/server.ts`. Each
 * had its OWN list until 2026-10-05, and the viewer server's named six forked
 * modules that had drifted from the ones the other served. Now neither has a
 * list: both call {@link registerServedToolGroups}, which reads every Tool
 * node in the folio's dependency tree (owner, bean riit 3c). What remains here
 * is the loading: resolve a declared module by variable path, call its
 * registrar, and report which of three things happened.
 *
 * That mechanism lived in `adapters/mcp-server/tool-groups.ts`, which is
 * core's. The harness is the BASE repository — core may import it, it may not
 * import core — so `src/server.ts` could not reuse it and had to import its
 * one core tool group directly. Same lesson as the render targets: the
 * mechanism is generic and belongs at the base; the declaration is per-layer
 * and belongs with the layer that owns the tools.
 *
 * ## An absent layer is a determined absence, not a crash and not silence
 *
 * A group whose module is not present is **skipped and reported**, because
 * after the split a core-only checkout legitimately has no science layer and
 * must still start. That is the one behaviour a hardcoded import cannot have.
 * It is equally not silent: a server that quietly starts without a tool group
 * looks identical to one where that group is broken, and the operator finds
 * out from a failing call rather than from the boot log.
 *
 * A group that IS present and fails to load is a different state again —
 * reported as an error, never as "this layer is not installed", because the
 * remedy is opposite (fix the module vs install the layer).
