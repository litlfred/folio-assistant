/**
 * The memory tools an agent is offered: `memory_note`, `memory_checkpoint`
 * and `memory_recall` (cat-harness#991 proposal §4.14, steps 16 and 20).
 *
 * Their own Tool group, registered apart from the `workflow_*` tools, so a run
 * can offer memory to an agent told nothing about processes or the work plan
 * (owner, 2026-11-03: *"would an agent still see it through the dependency
 * tree … in that case it needs to be own tool"*). Everything the agent reads
 * — names, descriptions, inputs, answers — is neutral: no instance, item,
 * store, process or role.
 *
 * Behind them (*"in reality a bean with metadata wrapped in the backend, just
 * not exposed to agent"*; Q17, layered): the memory store's `keep` and
 * `recall`, through the deployment's work-context store. The run's launcher
 * binds the session:
 *
 * - {@link WORK_INSTANCE_ENV}: the instance the agent works in. Its item is
 *   the agent's own memory of the work, and the backend fills each entry's
 *   process, step and instance.
 * - {@link SHARED_SPACE_ENV}: a memory record a group of agents shares (a
 *   swarm, §4.14). `shared: true` reads and writes it.
 * - {@link AGENT_ID_ENV}: who the agent is, for the entries it keeps.
 *
 * A note is a hand-over another agent reads later, so it passes the same
 * screen as `workflow_complete`'s note: an instruction in it is kept as data,
 * marked, never obeyed.
