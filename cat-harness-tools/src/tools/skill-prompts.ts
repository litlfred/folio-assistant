/**
 * Every skill that says a PERSON may invoke it, served as an MCP prompt.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/src/tools/skill-prompts
 *
 * Bean `j6t3`, option F, on the owner's choice of 2026-09-30 ("F + A").
 * Measured that day: 40 skills declare `user_invocable: true` and 3 could be
 * typed as a slash command. The declaration said a person may reach for the
 * skill; no host let them.
 *
 * ## Prompts, not tools — and that is the owner's rule, not a preference
 *
 * MCP has two primitives that look alike and are not. A **tool** is offered to
 * the model; a **prompt** is listed for the person, who picks one. Claude Code
 * renders a server's prompts as `/mcp__<server>__<name>` slash commands. So the
 * person-facing half of a skill is a prompt, and this module registers no tool.
 *
 * It also keeps the owner's 2026-09-21 ruling, *"keep tools and skills
 * separate!"*, by construction: nothing here mints a Tool node or writes into
 * `tools/`. A prompt is an INVOCATION of a skill — the skill's own body, sent
 * as the person's message — and the skill stays where it is declared.
 *
 * ## One derivation, two surfaces
 *
 * {@link userInvocableSkills} is also what `scripts/gen-skill-commands.ts`
 * reads to write `.claude/commands/` (option A). Two surfaces from one list is
 * the point: the 3-of-40 gap was two hand-kept surfaces drifting from the
 * declarations, and a third hand-kept one would drift the same way.
