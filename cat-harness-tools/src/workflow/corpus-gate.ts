/**
 * The commit boundary: refuse a corpus write the process never authorised.
 *
 * Everything before this was answerable — `workflow_gate` will tell an agent
 * whether a step is enabled, if it asks. This is the piece that does not
 * depend on asking. It runs from a pre-commit hook or from CI, so an agent
 * that ignored the whole orchestration still cannot land a block change that
 * no instance records the editor having seen the findings for.
 *
 * That is the difference the proposal called a map versus a rail
 * (`docs/proposals/workflow-orchestration.md` §4), and the reason it is here
 * rather than inside each of twenty-five capability tools: it is one place,
 * and it is not the agent that runs it.
 *
 * ## What counts as a corpus write
 *
 * A changed file that is a block manifest, or a sibling of one — `<block>.ts`,
 * `.md`, `.lean`, and *not* `.qa.json`, which is machine-written by the sweep
 * and would make every sweep look like an unauthorised edit. Anything else is
 * ignored: this gate is about content, not about the platform.
 *
 * ## Identity comes from the module, and failure is closed
 *
 * The block's label is read by importing it (`loadBlockModuleSync`), gated by
 * the cheap textual check so only real manifests are executed — the same split
 * `walkBlocks` uses. Only the changed files are loaded, so the cost is O(the
 * diff) rather than O(the corpus).
 *
 * A block whose label cannot be established is **refused**, not waved through.
 * A gate that fails open is a gate that reports clean by not looking.
 *
 * ## Two approved routes
 *
 * One edit to one block goes through `editing-hci-validation`, and its
 * instance must have reached `Task_Commit`. A change set (one PR, many blocks)
 * goes through `content-change-review` instead: a block passes when a running
 * change-set instance committed in the same diff lists it in `scope.blocks`
 * and has finished its make phase (`change-set-coverage.ts`). Committee
 * approval and the merge stay person steps after that, and the verdict says
 * so. A block in neither is refused as before.
