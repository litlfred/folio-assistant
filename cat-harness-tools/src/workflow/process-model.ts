/**
 * Read a `.bpmn` file into a graph the interpreter can walk.
 *
 * The workflow diagrams under `processes/` are already the normative
 * picture of how a change reaches the corpus, and every activity already names
 * the skill that implements it (`<bootstrap.processes:skill ref="…"/>`) and whether it
 * touches the work plan (`<cat-harness.processes:bean/>`). Until now nothing read them at
 * runtime: they were documentation an agent was trusted to have absorbed.
 *
 * This turns the same file into a model. `bpmn-moddle` — the parser bpmn.io
 * uses — does the XML, so the extension elements survive parsing and the
 * diagram interchange is ignored rather than reimplemented.
 *
 * ## What it supports, and why refusing the rest matters
 *
 * Nine element types: start and end events, the four activity kinds, exclusive
 * and parallel gateways, sequence flows. That is everything the six diagrams
 * in this repo use, and it is deliberately the whole list.
 *
 * Anything else — an inclusive gateway, a boundary event, an embedded
 * sub-process, a timer — throws at parse time and names what it found. The
 * alternative is to skip the element and keep walking, which produces a
 * process that runs, reports progress, and silently is not the process on the
 * diagram. This repo has that failure recorded twice over: a hand-written kind
 * list that omitted `algorithm` and `table` hid ~13% of a corpus from every QA
 * tool, and a walk that quietly dropped unlabelled blocks hid 27,390 words. A
 * gate that passes by not looking is worse than no gate.

 * ## Why this is not a cosmetic change
 *
 * Collapsing every run of whitespace, newlines included, meant an author had NO
 * WAY to put a paragraph break in documentation. A literal blank line was eaten;
 * `&#10;` was eaten too, because the XML parser decodes it to a newline BEFORE
 * this code sees it. The only spelling that survived was `&amp;#10;`, which
 * decodes to the five NON-whitespace characters `&#10;` — so it passed the
 * collapse and the published page showed them as literal text:
 *
 *     Dependency advisories&#10;&#10;THIS DIAGRAM IS DELIBERATELY SMALL
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-26 (bean `li5y`): **90** such instances across 8 process
 * files, surfacing in 50 `.pot` msgids across five locales, so translators were
 * handed the escape sequence inside the string to translate. Every one of them
 * is an author defeating this normaliser the only way that worked. Treating them
 * as 90 authoring mistakes and sweeping them would have left the cause in place
 * for the next author to rediscover.
 *
 * ## What it still collapses, and why that half was right
 *
 * Indentation. A `.bpmn` is pretty-printed, so a documentation body arrives with
 * every line indented to its element's depth; without collapsing that, the page
 * would carry the XML's layout.
 *
 * One run of whitespace, one decision, which is what makes the indentation
 * problem disappear rather than need a second pass: a run CONTAINING a newline
 * becomes newlines alone — so `"\n    "` yields `"\n"` and the indentation is
 * absorbed by the same match that produced the break — and a run containing no
 * newline becomes a single space. Three or more newlines are clamped to two,
 * since a paragraph break is the largest gap that means anything.

 * **Refused:** a declared `accepts` that is not the called adjudicator's enum, and a
 * declared `accepts` on a call into a process that adjudicates nothing. Both are
 * claims a reader would act on that no longer hold.
 *
 * **Not refused — reported instead, by `check:workflow-refs`:** a caller that
 * declares NOTHING. Every one of the six callers in this corpus was in that
 * state when the attribute was added, so refusing absence would mean either
 * failing the corpus on day one or backfilling six declarations nobody had
 * grounds for. Four of the six ask `Process_Adjudication` a question its three
 * QA-criterion outcomes do not obviously answer, and guessing an `accepts` for
 * them would convert an open question into a checked-looking assertion — the
 * `dh4f` shape pointed the wrong way. An undeclared caller is "could not
 * determine", and that is never rendered as clean.
 *
 * **Not checked at all:** a call into a process no file here defines. A folio
 * may legitimately call out, the descent above already leaves those opaque,
 * and a refusal would be this checker reporting on something it cannot see.
 *
 * ## Why set equality rather than a subset
 *
 * A caller accepting a strict subset would be saying it can act on some of the
 * answers the adjudicator may give — which means the others reach it and it does
 * something undefined with them. There is no useful reading of a partial
 * accept, so it is the same defect as a wrong one.
