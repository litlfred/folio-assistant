 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * The pipeline step is **"publish a large artifact"**, and *how* is a property
 * of the instance, not of the step; a GitHub Release is one implementation, a
 * CDN such as Cloudflare another. As with `publication.host`, an instance that
 * has not said is `undefined`, and must never be read as `github-pages`.
 *
 * A store holds what is too large for the site tree (e.g. a search index for a
 * large catalogue), somewhere the site budget does not reach.
 *
 * ## Staging gets NO index
 *
 * A correctness rule: a release-built index on staging would return hits for
 * pages that have since changed — a wrong pass, believed. Absent is honest;
 * stale is not. So staging disables search and SAYS SO, since silence would
 * read as "no results".
