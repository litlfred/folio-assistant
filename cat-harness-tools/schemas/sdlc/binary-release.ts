/**
 * Binary releases — what was published, under what version, with what digest.
 * **Never the bytes.**
 *
 * @module schemas/binary-release
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * One node per release. It records a release's id, its version, each asset's
 * digest and size, and where each asset is fetched from. It holds no content,
 * and the schema is `.strict()` throughout so a field carrying a payload
 * cannot be added by accident.
 *
 * ## Not a `materialization`
 *
 * Every `MATERIALIZATION_PURPOSES` value (`working | archival | both |
 * compiled`) is about a **copy this instance holds**. A release is about a
 * **publication upstream**, true whether or not a byte was ever fetched and
 * after every local copy is deleted. The two compose: a release node says
 * *v1.8.0 published `package.tgz`, 41 MB, sha256 …, at this URL*; a
 * materialization record says *and a copy of it is here, taken for this
 * purpose*.
 *
 * ## `state`, and `recordsWork: false`
 *
 * The release pipeline appends a node when it publishes, so it is `state`. It
 * is not `derived`: re-running a release pipeline produces a **different
 * release** (unlike {@link module:schemas/ig-metadata-index | `ig-metadata-index`},
 * where re-harvesting an unchanged IG gives the same file back).
 * `recordsWork: false`: a published release is a completed fact, nothing an
 * arriving agent can pick up. `check:graph-typology-work` refuses a `state`
 * kind that has not decided.
 *
 * ## The case the kind exists for: the deploy purge
 *
 * Files larger than 100 MB are deleted from the deployed tree before
 * deployment, after which nothing else records that they existed. A release
 * node is the only place that fact can live, which is why
 * {@link ASSET_DISPOSITIONS} has a value for it and why an asset in that state
 * must still say where it is fetched from.
 *
 * ## Three things enforced structurally
 *
 * 1. **Never the bytes.** Every object is `.strict()`, so a `content` or
 *    `data` key fails validation rather than being carried, and `fetchedFrom`
 *    is required on every asset — including a purged one.
 * 2. **A deletion must say why.** `deleted-before-deploy` requires
 *    `dispositionReason`, so a decision can be told from an accident.
 * 3. **Could-not-determine is never clean.** `verifiedAt` lives INSIDE
 *    {@link ReleaseDigestSchema}, so a verification time with no digest is
 *    unrepresentable. And {@link binaryReleaseVerdict} returns `unknown`,
 *    never `ok`, for a release with any undigested asset or any disposition
 *    nobody has established.
