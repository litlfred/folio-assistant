/**
 * QA ATTESTATIONS — the judgement half of a QA verdict, kept on `main` where a
 * `git rm` of derived results cannot reach it.
 *
 * Every non-script verdict stays on main; derived script verdicts live on the
 * `qa-reports` branch. `baseline` pair attestations count as judgements,
 * because a regenerated baseline forgets the drift it recorded. Split by
 * provenance, the derived half can be deleted without touching the
 * judgements.
 *
 * ## Layout — ONE convention for every QA family
 *
 * ```
 * <instance>/test/attestations/            the declared `attestations` directory
 * └── <family>/<mirrored subject path>/<stem>.attestations.json
 * ```
 *
 * `<family>` is the derived family the judgements sit beside — `kg-qa`,
 * `block-qa` or `translation-qa` — and the mirror below it is EXACTLY the one
 * that family's derived tree uses, so the attestation for a subject is found
 * by swapping the tree root and the suffix. A hosted layer (one with no
 * `attestations` directory of its own, audited from a host) lives under
 * `<host>/test/attestations/<stub>/`, the same three answers
 * {@link attestationsHomeFor} shares with `kgQaHomeFor`.
 *
 * ## The envelope — `qa-attestations/v1`
 *
 * ```json
 * { "$schema": "qa-attestations/v1",
 *   "family": "kg-qa",
 *   "subject": { "kind": "skill", "id": "…", "path": "…" },
 *   "pair_attestations": [ … ],      // kg-qa
 *   "voice_reviews": [ … ] }         // kg-qa
 * ```
 *
 * A family adds its own judgement arrays; the envelope (`$schema`, `family`,
 * `subject`) is shared. Each judgement is keyed by the subject plus what it
 * attests and the HASH it attested, so a stale one is detectable by
 * recomputing the hash: a pair attestation carries `prose_hash` and
 * `code_hash`, a voice review `skill_hash` and `voice_hash`.
 *
 * Entries are stored byte-for-byte as their writer produced them (same keys,
 * same order); `scripts/migrate-qa-attestations.ts` verifies that against the corpus.
 *
 * ## Five read states
 *
 * {@link readAttestationFile} answers `hit` / `miss` / `absent` / `corrupt` /
 * `unknown`, the vocabulary `scripts/qa-store.ts` uses plus `absent`:
 *
 * - `miss` — the store is there and this subject has no file. A hosted
 *   layer's subtree that does not exist yet is a `miss` too.
 * - `absent` — the store directory itself is not there: a folio that has never
 *   had one.
 * - `unknown` — the store path is there and could not be read.
 * - `corrupt` — the file is there and does not parse or validate. Never `[]`,
 *   and never overwritten: the next writer refuses it.
 *
 * ## Auto-move on first save
 *
 * On `miss` or `absent`, a WRITER looks at the prior derived file before it
 * treats the subject as first sight. Judgements still inside that file are
 * MOVED into the store as it saves. The store file is written before the
 * derived one, and on `kg-qa` the derived sidecar it then writes carries no
 * judgement.
 *
 * What still refuses (writes nothing, exits non-zero): `corrupt` and
 * `unknown`, and a prior derived file that cannot be parsed while the store
 * has no entry. On a `hit` the store is the source: the prior derived file is
 * never read for judgements. If a store and a prior derived file are BOTH
 * gone, nothing can say a judgement existed; the store is committed on main,
 * so its deletion is a diff a reviewer sees.
 *
 * ## `block-qa` and `translation-qa`
 *
 * Their judgements are `criteria` entries whose `reviewer.kind` is not
 * `script` — an agent's adjudication or a human ruling. Their member of the
 * union carries a `criteria` map with the derived report's own shape and
 * ONLY those entries ({@link CriteriaAttestationsSchema} refuses a script
 * one), so an entry moves between the two files without being rewritten. The
 * subject is `{kind: "block", id, path}` with `id` and `path` both the
 * instance-relative subject root (the `.ts`/`.md` stem the derived mirror is
 * built from); `translation-qa` adds `locale`.
 *
 * Unlike `kg-qa`, a derived block or translation report still carries a
 * PROJECTION of its judgements, because readers (and the published site)
 * take `criteria[id][0]` as the operative verdict. A writer composes that
 * projection from the store ({@link resolvePrior}, {@link finalizeCriteria});
 * it is never the source once the store holds the subject.
