/**
 * The checkout's script table, read from where each script lives.
 *
 * Each layer carries the scripts whose command runs ITS code, in its own
 * `package.json` under `checkoutScripts`; the root keeps only the few that
 * run no layer's code (the whole-checkout `test` and `typecheck`, and the
 * `bootstrap-tools` submodule's own commands) plus `cat`, the runner.
 *
 * ## Why `checkoutScripts` and not `scripts`
 *
 * Every command here is written relative to the CHECKOUT ROOT, and
 * `bun run cat <name>` runs it there. A layer's `scripts` key, by the
 * convention `bootstrap-tools` already keeps, is run from the LAYER's
 * directory (`cd <layer> && bun run <name>`), where root-relative commands
 * would fail.
 *
 * ## How a script is found
 *
 * By asking the declared instances, never by naming one: this module is the
 * LOWEST layer's, so a literal list here would point up the layer order.
 * {@link instanceRootsIn} answers which directories are instances; each one's
 * `package.json` is read for `checkoutScripts`. A name defined twice is an
 * error, not a precedence rule, except within the root's own manifest, where
 * `scripts` wins over the same name in its `checkoutScripts`.
 *
 * @graphNode none — functions that read the script table; no schema
 * @covers none — a reader of the script table, not a graph audit
