/**
 * The standalone fixture is a COPY of real nodes, and must stay one.
 *
 * `test/fixtures/standalone-checkout/` holds core's and sci's node graphs that
 * the schema tests read, so they pass with this layer standing alone
 * (owner, 2026-10-05: fixture the tests rather than grow the standalone
 * baseline; `test-fixture-preload.ts` says when it is scanned). A fixture that
 * drifts from what it copies would let a test pass on a vocabulary nobody
 * declares, so every file is held byte-equal to its source.
 *
 * Standing alone the sources are absent, and that half is reported as not
 * examined rather than passed.
