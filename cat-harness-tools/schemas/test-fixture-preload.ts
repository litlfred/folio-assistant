/**
 * Point node discovery at the standalone fixture when the checkout holds no
 * vocabulary — the first test preload, ahead of `test-preload.ts`.
 *
 * @module schemas/test-fixture-preload
 * @graphNode none — a test preload; it sets one environment variable and defines no schema
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * cat-harness's code types the paper vocabulary, whose nodes live with their
 * owners — document kinds in the content core, math kinds and the `paper`
 * adapter in the science layer. Standing alone, as
 * `check:cat-harness-standalone` runs it, none of them is there.
 *
 * So: when no instance in this checkout declares a `block-kinds` graph,
 * `FOLIO_FIXTURE_CHECKOUT` names `test/fixtures/standalone-checkout/`, which
 * `declared-nodes.ts` then scans beside the real checkout. In the monorepo it
 * is never set, so no test there can pass on the fixture instead of the real
 * nodes; `standalone-fixture.test.ts` holds the copies equal to the real ones.
 *
 * ## Why a separate preload
 *
 * Imports are hoisted, and `test-preload.ts` imports the graph-typology registry,
 * which scans declared `typologies/` graphs at load. The variable must be set
 * before that, so this file imports only the two leaves it needs and runs
 * first (`bunfig.toml`).
