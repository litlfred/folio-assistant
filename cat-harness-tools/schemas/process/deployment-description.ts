/**
 * **Deployment descriptions**: which declared actors run where, in one
 * deployment.
 *
 * 1. Descriptions live in a `deployments/` folder, several per instance (one
 *    instance may run as cloud agent sessions and on a workstation).
 * 2. Jurisdiction is four optional fields.
 * 3. The resolver only reports, and never fails. The checks here are about a
 *    description being well formed, not about whether every task can be run.
 *
 * ## What is new, and what is reused
 *
 * Only {@link Placement}, {@link Jurisdiction} and `liveData` are new. The
 * aggregate is the existing {@link Topology}, and every axis a placement
 * carries uses that axis's existing values.
 *
 * ## A placement is not an actor
 *
 * An actor in `scenarios/actors/` is abstract: it occupies a lane. A placement
 * says where that actor runs in one deployment. So a placement names an actor
 * that is already declared, and never declares a new one: roles and policies
 * stay with the actor.
 *
 * Where the actor's own file fixes a fact, the placement may not contradict
 * it. `attestation-service` declares `reach: "internet"` as part of what it
 * is; a placement that puts it air-gapped describes a different actor.
 *
 * ## Reach is never inherited
 *
 * A placement without `reach` is {@link REACH_UNKNOWN}, never the
 * deployment's value, under the same rule as `actor-reach.ts`. The only
 * exception is the one that module already makes: an air-gapped deployment
 * determines every participant.
