/**
 * User scenarios: a DAK user scenario told as a journey map, and the
 * building-block catalogue its steps say they use.
 *
 * @graphNode schema
 * @module schemas/user-scenario
 *
 * ## What a user scenario is
 *
 * The DAK logical model `UserScenario` has `id`, `title`,
 * `description[x]` and `personas`. This kind keeps those fields as they are
 * and adds the ordered **steps** a journey map is made of: for each step, who
 * does what and how they feel (one experience per actor present), what goes
 * wrong without it and what makes it work, how far the record can be trusted
 * once it is done, and what passes on. Each step points at the user stories
 * it satisfies (`scenarios/stories.json`, `user-story.ts`), the BPMN tasks
 * that carry it out, the `req:` requirements it exercises, the FHIR examples
 * it produces, and the building blocks it uses, each in the role it plays
 * there.
 *
 * The user stories stay role-level (caregiver); a scenario's steps are
 * persona-level (one fictional caregiver). The step's `stories` edge joins
 * the two.
 *
 * ## A journey IS a DAK user scenario
 *
 * The kind specialises the DAK user scenario (the `user-scenario` block kind
 * of the DAK vocabulary; the registry says so in `specialises`). It keeps the
 * DAK fields and adds the journey metadata, all of it optional from 0.4.0: a
 * file with only `id`, `title`, `description` and `personas` is a plain DAK
 * user scenario, listed by the viewer with no journey map.
 *
 * The two `personas` are one list read two ways. Here an entry is an actor
 * (one fictional person) or a role; the DAK's personas are ROLES (the BPMN
 * swimlanes), so a DAK reader gets them DERIVED: each actor's `roles`, and a
 * role as it is (`dakUserScenario`, `scripts/journeys/derive.ts`). Nothing
 * says the roles twice.
 *
 * ## Composition: a journey lists its parts
 *
 * Journeys are narrative, so their composition is AUTHORED, never inferred
 * from the BPMN: a process with sub-processes gets no journey unless somebody
 * writes one. One direction is authored (0.4.0):
 *
 * - `parts` on the PARENT, in story order: each a journey, `optional` when
 *   the story may skip it, `repeats` when it may happen more than once. A
 *   journey may be a part of more than one parent. Within a parent, which
 *   part a part follows is derived from the order, as is whose part it is.
 * - `includes` on a STEP: the step IS that journey, as a BPMN call activity
 *   is a process. When the step's `realisedBy` names a call activity,
 *   `check:journey-refs` checks that it calls a process the included journey
 *   is realised by.
 * - `follows` still chains journeys that no parent lists (J1, J2, J3, J4).
 *
 * `partOf` (0.2.0) said the same as `parts` from the child's side, one
 * parent only. It is read in an older file and refused in a 0.4.0 one, so a
 * 0.4.0 checkout has one way to group. A journey a parent lists carries no
 * `follows` (`check:journey-refs`: the parent's order says it).
 *
 * ## Four families, one shape
 *
 * `user-scenario/0.1.0` is the draft smart-trust-demo wrote and checked
 * (`docs/proposals/user-scenario/`, frozen 2026-11-05); every 0.1.0 file is
 * read unchanged. `user-scenario/0.2.0` adds what the harness needed to make
 * the viewer generic: `partOf`, `views` (ArchiMate views of the journey),
 * `references`, `illustrationStyle` and, on a step, `gaps` (what the
 * specification does not yet cover), `references`, `illustration` and
 * `fhirChanges` (the FHIR resources it creates or changes, told for a room),
 * and on a journey its `scene` (a few glyphs that picture it).
 * `user-scenario/0.3.0` adds a step's `dak`: the DAK assets the step uses, each
 * an artefact-index key and what it is to the step (the data set it records,
 * the decision table that decides it, the indicator that measures it).
 * `user-scenario/0.4.0` adds `parts` and a step's `includes`, refuses
 * `partOf`, and makes what can be derived optional: `personas` (from the
 * parts', for a journey that only groups), `steps`, and a step's `lead` and
 * `experiences` (by default, the actors who play the lanes of its
 * `realisedBy` tasks). Its `personas` may name roles as well as actors.
 * Nothing of an earlier minor changes meaning, and the kind accepts a 0.1.0,
 * 0.2.0 or 0.3.0 file as it is, by that file's own rules.
 *
 * ## What is NOT here, on purpose
 *
 * - Composition inferred from BPMN: a call activity or a sub-process is not
 *   a journey until somebody writes one.
 * - The workshop layer (questions a room is asked of a step, modules,
 *   decision rights, job aids): the `workshop` kind (`workshop.ts`), which
 *   points at step ids, so a scenario does not depend on any one workshop.
 * - Presentation (a persona's colours, a device screen): the persona's actor
 *   (`meta.persona`, {@link JourneyPersonaSchema}) or the app that shows it.

 * kind and its `meta` is open. Every persona is fictional.
 *
 * `initials`, `color` and `icon` are optional presentation fields (owner,
 * 2026-11-05): kept on the actor when a demonstrator wants a fixed avatar,
 * derived by the viewer when absent. `avatar` (owner, 2026-11-06) is a square
 * picture of the person, a path from the layer root
 * (`scenarios/avatars/<actor>.webp`): the viewer draws it wherever the
 * persona appears, and the initials (or the `icon`) on the colour stay the
 * fallback when there is none. `check:journey-refs` checks the path. Nothing
 * else in the harness reads them.
