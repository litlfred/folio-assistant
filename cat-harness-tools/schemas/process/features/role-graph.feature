# Specifies schemas/process/role-graph.ts: readRoleGraph (the strict role
# graph, including roles inherited from instances it needs), the skill
# closure (resolveRoleSkills) and subprocess composition (resolveRoleStack),
# how a BPMN lane names its role (roleForLane, laneRoleRef, laneBinding),
# mechanical roles, readActors and readPermissions, the three actor kinds and
# which may fulfil a BPMN activity, and lane holding (laneNeeded, electHolder,
# isStalled). Several scenarios read this repository's own role graph, actor
# registry, permission vocabulary and capability probes.

  Scenario: A self-mounting checkout finds the needed layer mounted inside its own root
    Given instance "top" needing "base", with a role "checker" that inherits "reviewer"
