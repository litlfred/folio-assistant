/**
 * The content types this layer owns, registered at load time.
 *
 * @module schemas/content-types-base
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * Separate from `content-type.ts` as `folio-graph-typology.ts` is separate
 * from `cat-harness.ts`: the registry is a mechanism and the entries are a
 * layer's opinion, declared only by the layer that owns them.
 *
 * Two are registered here — `harness` and `folio`.
 *
 * ## They are NOT the same type
 *
 * `harness` says *this is a layer*: a name, a stub, the directories it
 * holds. `folio` says *this authors folio content*: it carries `contentType`,
 * and `folio_init` writes it.
 *
 * ```
 *                        declared   contentType
 *   cat-harness/            yes         NO
 *   the repository root     yes         yes
 * ```
 *
 * Both are stated by one `<name>.config.json`, so the discriminator is its
 * CONTENT: `folioMarkerFilename` returns the file only when it declares a
 * `contentType`. A bare `{"name":"x"}` is an instance and not a folio. This
 * is what `isFolio` in `folio-intent.dmn` means.
 *
 * ## `dak`, `sushi` and `ig` are NOT here
 *
 * The DAK layer depends on core, so core recognising a DAK would be core
 * importing downstream (`check:partition:edges` refuses it). `dak` and `sushi`
 * live in {@link module:schemas/dak-content-type}, registered by the layer that
 * owns the model. `ig` is registered nowhere: nothing declares an IG
 * layer, so there is no marker file to recognise.

/**

 *
 * ## Why this exists, 2026-09-22
 *
 * The fallback's premise was written down as *"`.config.json` names a harness
 * artefact and nothing else"*. The owner's rename of the DAK marker from
 * `dak.json` to `dak.config.json` — for consistency with `<name>.config.json`,
 * and legitimate because the DAK type is ours (bean `cz17`) — **falsified that
 * premise**, and the repository's own tests caught it: a DAK repository was
 * reported as `["dak", "harness", "sushi"]` where it is `["dak", "sushi"]`.
 *
 * ## Derived, never listed
 *
 * It reads the registry rather than naming `dak.config.json`. A literal here
 * would have to be edited every time a type takes a config-suffixed marker,
 * and the edit that did not happen is invisible: the fallback would go on
 * asserting a harness membership nobody declared, and nothing would fail.
 *
 * This layer therefore stays ignorant of the DAK type, which is the split this
 * module's header insists on — `dak-content-type.ts` registers it, and all
 * this reads is that SOME type claimed the name.
 *
 * `harness` is excluded because it is this function's own caller, and `folio`
 * because its marker IS `<name>.config.json` — the two memberships are
 * deliberately asserted off one file.
