/**
 * A VOICE SKILL — a voice as a first-class member of the knowledge graph.
 *
 * ## A voice is a skill, not a data file beside one
 *
 * A voice tells an actor what to do, is bound to processes by name, and is
 * versioned with the graph — what a skill does. As a skill, its instructions
 * and its rules are the same node, owned by the same instance, so writing
 * guidance cannot drift away from the rules and their citations.
 *
 * A voice skill lives at `<instance>/skills/voices/<id>/`, inside the `kg`
 * graph, and the instance that holds it is the instance that DERIVED it.
 *
 * ## Three consumers, and the schema says which field serves which
 *
 * | process | what it reads | why |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | **authoring** | `instructions`, and the rules flagged {@link VoiceSkillRule.counterintuitive} | what to know BEFORE drafting — the rules where the instinct is wrong and the retrofit is expensive |
 * | **review / QC** | every rule with its `source` | a reviewer upholds a finding by opening the cited page, never by trusting the rule's wording |
 * | **QA** | `patterns`, `terminology`, `judgementOnly`, {@link VoiceSkillSchema} `overlaySeverity` | the mechanical half, and the weight of the derived overlay criterion |
 *
 * **No field serves two of those by restatement.** The instruction body must
 * not enumerate rules. `scripts/check-voice-skills.ts` enforces it, on four
 * signals — a rule's id, its title, its citation's quote, and both sides of a
 * terminology pair.
 *
 * @module schemas/voice-skill
 * @graphNode schema

/**
 * Where a voice skill lives, relative to the instance that owns it.
 *
 * `skills/` rather than `voices/` because a voice IS a skill; the `voices/`
 * segment under it because the `kg` graph holds several kinds and a reader
 * scanning for voices should not have to open every skill to find them.
 *
 * **The owning instance is the one the voice BELONGS TO semantically, and it
 * is a judgement.** Owner, 2026-09-21: *"voices should be associated to
 * appropriate home semantically/by judgement."*
 *
 * This entry said "the one that DERIVED the voice" until then, which reads as
 * a mechanical rule — follow the sources — and the corpus falsifies it twice:
 *
 * - `who-editorial` is read out of a WHO publication held by the IRIS replica, and
 *   lived in `who-style-guide` until 2026-10-01. Where the source sat did not
 *   decide that, and it did not decide the fold either: it now lives in
 *   the IRIS replica because the owner ruled the style guide DERIVATIVE content of
 *   that catalogue (bean `qsx4`), a judgement about what it is.
 * - `technical-writer` is read out of RFC 2119 and RFC 8174, both ingested in
 *   `agent-skills`, and lives in the content core — because what it is
 *   ABOUT is how to write technical documentation of a standard, software or
 *   a knowledge asset, which is what that layer is for.
 *
 * The one part that is not a judgement: **the platform holds none of it.**
 * `cat-harness` runs the checks and declares no voices, which is the boundary
 * bean `btuv` exists to keep.
