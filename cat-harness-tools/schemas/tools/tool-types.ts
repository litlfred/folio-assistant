 * A plain non-negative count — how many of something, or how many to show.
 *
 * ## Why this exists, and why it did not until 2026-09-20
 *
 * This vocabulary had **no general numeric type**. `Dpi` and `Port` are both
 * numbers and both mean something specific, so neither can stand in for "a
 * number of things", and the honest move at each call site was to leave the
 * input undeclared and say so in a comment. Two nodes did exactly that:
 * `content-graph-build`, whose edge counts became one `Text` report, and
 * `fsh-cone`, whose `--top N` and `--history N` are still not declared.
 *
 * **Two independent needs is the bar.** The rule this repository keeps is that
 * adding a type to fit ONE flag is how a vocabulary stops meaning anything —
 * and that rule was applied, twice, by refusing to invent `Count` for a single
 * node. It is a different judgement once the same gap has been met from two
 * directions by two different mechanisms.
 *
 * ## The bounds, and what each is for
 *
 * `min(0)` because a count of zero is a real answer and the commonest one worth
 * reporting: zero findings, zero blocks, zero edges. Excluding it would push
 * every such case into a sentinel or an absent field, which is the third-state
 * confusion this vocabulary exists to prevent.
 *
 * `int()` and a finite `max` because that is what makes it **injection-safe by
 * construction**, the same argument `Dpi` and `Port` carry: a value bearing a
 * shell metacharacter does not parse, so it can reach argv. An unbounded number
 * would admit `Infinity` and `1e21`, which stringify into argv as words no
 * consumer expects. The ceiling is deliberately far above any real corpus —
 * it bounds the TYPE, not the domain, and a node needing a tighter limit says so
 * in its port description rather than by minting a narrower type.
 *
 * NOT for a limit that must be positive. `--top 0` is a legitimate request for
 * nothing, and a type that forbade it would be asserting a policy that belongs
 * to the flag.

 * Types whose *values cannot be a shell payload*, because the type refuses to

 *
 * The usual answer to command injection is "pass an argv array, never build a
 * shell string". That is necessary and this repo does it — but it is a property
 * of the *caller*, and a caller is one refactor away from a template literal.
 *
 * The property that survives a careless caller is the **value never being
 * dangerous in the first place**. `BeanStatus` is an enum: `"; rm -rf /"` is not
 * a member and `parse` rejects it. `BeanId` is `^[a-z0-9-]+$`: no space, no
 * semicolon, no `$(`, no backtick. A constrained type makes the payload
 * unrepresentable rather than merely unexecuted.
 *
 * So a Tool input **may not reference an unconstrained type**. That is checked,
 * not documented — see `scripts/check-tools.ts`.
 *
 * ## Markdown is excluded, on purpose
 *
 * Prose genuinely can contain any character, so no pattern admits real markdown
 * and excludes a payload. Rather than pretend, `Markdown` is simply not
 * admissible as an *argument*. A Tool that needs free text takes it on **stdin**
 * or from a file, where it is data rather than part of a command line. That is a
 * real constraint on Tool design and it is the right one: a tool whose prose
 * argument is a command-line word was always going to need quoting nobody
 * checks.
