/**
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * A tabular source as CSVW, annotated with what CSVW cannot say.
 *
 * CSVW is a W3C Recommendation that is already JSON-LD, so a tabular source
 * reuses a published vocabulary rather than a folio invention. It models
 * table → column → datatype and **nothing else**: no formulas, no merged
 * cells, no styling.
 *
 * **What CSVW cannot express is WHERE a table is**, because in CSVW the table
 * IS the file. A real workbook breaks that three ways: tables that do not
 * start at A1, headers that are not row 1, and several tables on one sheet.
 *
 * So {@link SheetAnchorSchema} and friends are annotations on the CSVW
 * shape, carried in a record that is **plain JSON** — `tabular.csvw.json`,
 * not `.jsonld` — and {@link toCsvw} derives the genuine CSVW metadata
 * document from it. A CSVW reader is handed that, and only that.
 *
 * ## Why the record is JSON and not JSON-LD
 *
 * CSVW metadata documents may put only `@language` and `@base` in a local
 * context, so a prefix of ours can never be bound there. Nothing reads these
 * annotations as linked data — the graph projection
 * (`pipeline/tabular-nodes.ts`) reads `anchor.sheet` from the JSON — and
 * JSON-LD DROPS `null`, while the three-state rule below depends on a
 * DETERMINED null (a CSV's sheet is `null` because a CSV has none). The
 * `fac:` spelling of the keys is a plain JSON name marking our fields apart
 * from CSVW's, not a compact IRI.
 *
 * ## "As best as can" is the three-state rule
 *
 * Every field is determined, or explicitly undetermined WITH A REASON.
 * Nothing defaults. A column that will not classify gets `datatype: "any"`
 * and `fac:datatypeSource: "undetermined"` — never a guess that reads as a
 * measurement.
 *
 * ## No extractor ships with this
 *
 * The tools are declared and STUBBED, and {@link TabularStubSchema} is what
 * makes a stub impossible to mistake for a result. A stub is never `met`; it
 * is `not-derivable` naming the tool that would fill it.
