/**
 * `<library>/<slug>/extraction.json` — which extractors ran over an entry, and
 * what each found.
 *
 * ## Why a record and not the artefacts
 *
 * An artefact's ABSENCE says nothing. An entry with no `tabular.csvw.json` is
 * either a document that prints no table or one whose table step never ran,
 * and a viewer showing "no tables" over the second is telling the reader
 * something nobody checked (owner, 2026-11-14: "not sure all have biblio,
 * glossary, table, figure, keyword, TOC, section, summaries etc fully
 * extracted"). So each step that runs says so here, per KIND:
 *
 * | state | means |
 * |---|---|
 * | `found` | the step ran and found `count` (> 0) |
 * | `partial` | the step ran and found some, but not all it could stand behind — the `note` says what is missing (a contents tree refused below the trust floor, vector renders not yet inspected) |
 * | `none` | the step ran over the source and found nothing |
 * | `not-extracted` | no step for this kind ran, or it ran and could not look — the `note` says which |
 *
 * A kind this record does not name is `not-extracted`, never `none`: "nobody
 * looked" and "somebody looked and found nothing" are different facts, and a
 * default would collapse them.
 *
 * The shape is the one the library viewer reads (`entryCoverage` in
 * `scripts/lib/library-document.ts`), so the two cannot drift: kinds
 * `contents`, `sections`, `figures`, `tables`, `references`, `glossary`,
 * `footnotes`, `summaries`. `tool`, `version`, `at` and `doc_id` are
 * provenance the viewer ignores.
 *
 * Written by `cat ingest` (`scripts/entry-extraction.ts`); another layer's
 * step — a reference-list or glossary reader — records its own kind through
 * `recordExtraction` in the same module. ADVISORY: `check-l1-complete.ts`
 * reports it per entry and gates nothing on it.
