/**
 * The two visualiser generators produce a page, and it is a whole one.
 *
 * @module schemas/viz-generators.test
 * @graphNode none — a test over the generators, not a schema itself
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for, which cost a push
 *
 * Both viewers are authored as a TypeScript **template literal** holding a
 * whole HTML document, and a backtick anywhere inside it — including inside a
 * JavaScript comment in the embedded script — silently terminates the string.
 * That happened here: a comment reading *"the intake's own `files[]`"* turned
 * the rest of the page into TypeScript, and the generator exited 1 at a line
 * number 200 lines from the mistake.
 *
 * Nothing caught it but running the generator by hand. Importing the module
 * is enough to catch the parse error, and asserting the page's shape catches
 * the subtler version — a truncated document that still parses.
