/**
 * A downstream layer INHERITS the ingestion directories, and gets them made.
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20: *"please add back uploads/ folder … library/ should
 * also be added in at initation."*
 *
 * **"Add back" turned out not to mean restore.** Both directories are present,
 * declared and populated in this checkout — `uploads/` with the raw queue,
 * `library/` with 1455 tracked files — so the ask is about what a *newly
 * initiated* layer gets, not about this one. Measured before anything was
 * written, so that nobody goes looking for a deletion to revert or "restores" a
 * directory over one that already has contents.
 *
 * And a newly initiated layer **already gets both**: they are declared
 * instance-scoped in `cat-harness/harness.json`, so `resolveDirectories` hands
 * them to every dependent and `materialiseDeclaredDirectories` — which
 * `init-folio` calls — creates them in the dependent's own root.
 *
 * So why a test rather than nothing? Because that property holds by a chain of
 * four facts, **none of which is stated anywhere**, and one of them is a single
 * absent JSON key. Adding `"scope": "repository"` to the `uploads` entry would
 * be a plausible-looking edit that silently stops every downstream folio getting
 * an ingestion queue — `resolveDirectories` skips a repository-scoped entry for
 * a dependency on purpose, and the folio would simply have nowhere to drop a
 * file. Nothing would fail. This is what makes that loud.

 * A dependent layer materialises its own `docs/` — bean `n0nf`, issue #638.
 *
 * ## Why this is a test and not a line in the declaration
 *
 * `docs` was `dependents: "skip"`, and the argument for that was GOOD: a
 * dependent should **inherit the pages** rather than get an empty directory to
 * refill. The owner's compose ruling (2026-09-21) does not overturn it — under
 * an overlay a dependent gets both, the pages *and* somewhere to override one —
 * so the flip to `reproduce` is the second half of that argument arriving, not
 * a reversal of it.
 *
 * Which is exactly why it needs a test. **Flipping one JSON word back is a
 * plausible-looking edit**, the old rationale still reads persuasively in the
 * same entry, and nothing else in the repository would fail: a downstream folio
 * would simply have nowhere declared to document itself, silently. That is the
 * shape `wwi6` guards for `uploads/` and `library/`, and this is the same guard
 * pointed at `docs`.
 *
 * ## It asserts the CONTRAST, not just the presence
 *
 * `schemas` and `tools` are the platform's own and must stay unmaterialised.
 * Asserting only that `docs` appears would pass just as well against a build
 * that inherited everything — which is the junk the `dependents` field exists
 * to prevent, and would read as success.
