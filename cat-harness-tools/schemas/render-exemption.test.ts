/**
 * The rendering exemption, as the QA axis's checker reads it.

 * @module cat-harness-tools/schemas/render-exemption.test
 *
 * Moved here from `cat-harness/schemas/render-exemption.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`
 * follow-up; owner, 2026-10-06: a test reading an upper layer's files moves to
 * that layer's declared test home). The test reads
 * `cat-harness-tools/scripts/check-instance-render.ts`, a file of THIS layer,
 * so standing alone cat-harness cannot hold it. The rest of that file's tests
 * — the declaration, the malformations, the closed set — stay with the schema
 * they test. Every path here is composed from ORIGIN_DIR, the directory the
 * test was written in, so nothing it reads changed.
