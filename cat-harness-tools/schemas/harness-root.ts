/**
 * Where the cat-harness instance lives: the directory holding `cat-harness.json`.
 *
 * Schema modules that need cat-harness's data files (`code-lists/`,
 * `test/fixtures/`, the declaration) cannot find them by walking up from
 * their own file, since they live in cat-harness-tools. This is the one place
 * that says where the harness is.
 *
 * Tried in order:
 *
 * 1. `CAT_HARNESS_ROOT`, for a checkout laid out some other way.
 * 2. A `cat-harness/` directory beside this repository.
 * 3. The `@litlfred/cat-harness` package, as a composed index links it.
 *
 * The sibling comes before the package: in a composed index they are the same
 * directory, and where they differ (the standalone rehearsal,
 * `probeStandalone`, links the index's `node_modules` beside a scratch
 * closure) the package resolves to the wrong cat-harness.
 *
 * Does not throw at import: a module that only needs the harness for one
 * function should still load where the harness is absent.
 *
 * @graphNode none — functions that locate the harness instance; no schema
 * @module schemas/harness-root
