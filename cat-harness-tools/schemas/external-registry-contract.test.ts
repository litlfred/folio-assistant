/**
 * The `external-registry` role held to its contract,
 * `skills/kg/kg-core/external-registry-contract.md`.
 *
 * The registry is played by a party this instance does not run, so what a test
 * here can hold is the side of the contract that is ours: which lane relies on
 * the registry, and what the verifier does when the registry does not answer.
 * The contract says so itself ("This side of the contract is ours, and it is
 * what makes relying on a party we do not control safe").
 *
 * What cannot run here, and is therefore not claimed: lines 1 and 2 of "What
 * it must do" — publishing the GDHCN trustlist and serving a slice by its
 * hierarchical path. They are the registry's own behaviour, on a network this
 * container cannot reach (`kg-to-portal`: the endpoints are "transcribed, not
 * fetched").
