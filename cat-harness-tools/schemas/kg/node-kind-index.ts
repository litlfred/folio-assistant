/**
 * Every node kind a checkout declares, found THROUGH the graph typologies.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/schemas/node-kind-index
 * @graphNode none — a function library over the typology registry; it defines no schema
 *
 * ## Two concepts, no third
 *
 * - a **graph typology** is what a DIRECTORY holds — its `$schema` families
 *   (`nodeSchemas`), each naming the TypeScript that validates it;
 * - a **node kind** is a `nodeKind()` in TypeScript — a class whose parents
 *   make it a subclass.
 *
 * This module joins them and adds nothing: where a family's (or a typology's)
 * `validator` names a `nodeKind()` export, that kind is the family's node kind.
 * There is no list of kinds to keep and no source scan.
 *
 * ## The declaring harness is not written down
 *
 * It is the instance the validator ref names — `core:schemas/x.ts#XKind` is
 * declared by `core` — or, for an unqualified ref, the instance the ref
 * resolves against (cat-harness).
 *
 * ## UNKINDED is a third state, not a failure
 *
 * A family whose validator is a bare Zod schema, or that names none, is
 * reported as unkinded with the reason, so the gate holds existing ones as a
 * baseline and fails only on a NEW one.
 *
 * ## One baseline per layer
 *
 * Each family is OWNED by the instance that declares its typology
 * ({@link typologyOwner}), each instance keeps its own families in a declared
 * asset of role `unkinded-baseline` ({@link UnkindedBaselineKind}), and
 * {@link ratchet} judges each instance against its own. The combined table
 * for the node-kind pages is built at publish (cat-harness's
 * `builtAtPublish`), never committed.
