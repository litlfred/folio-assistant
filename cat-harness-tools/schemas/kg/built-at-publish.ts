/**
 * Artefacts an instance must NOT commit, because no commit of it can hold them
 * current: they are built when the site is published, and only then.
 *
 * @module schemas/built-at-publish
 * @graphNode none — a declaration shape and two pure readers over it
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * An artefact may be committed in an instance only if every input it is
 * computed from is pinned BY THAT INSTANCE'S OWN COMMIT: its own tree, plus the
 * instances it `needs` at the pins its own lock names. Two ways to fail it,
 * and {@link BuiltAtPublishSchema} names which one each entry fails:
 *
 * - `checkout` — computed over every instance the checkout stacks on this one.
 *   Those are ABOVE it (they `need` it), so it cannot pin them, and the bytes
 *   are a function of the consuming index's lock, not of this commit.
 * - `state` — computed from a graph kept on a branch (`beans`, `todos`, `qa`),
 *   which moves without a commit (`check:derived-from`'s storage clock,
 *   for artefacts that are not a declared directory).
 *
 * ## A list in the declaration, not only `.gitignore`
 *
 * `.gitignore` says "never committed" but not who builds the file. The
 * declaration names the WRITER (a package script, run as
 * `bun run cat <script>` — a script NAME, because the generators live in a layer
 * above this one), so the publish step can run it and a gate can refuse an
 * entry nobody builds. `built-at-publish.test.ts` keeps the two equal: every
 * declared path is ignored, and nothing declared is tracked.
 *
 * ## Writer order
 *
 * `derive:publish` runs every instance's writers lowest layer first
 * (dependency order), each instance's entries in their declared order, a
 * writer named twice running once, at its first mention. A writer that reads
 * another instance's publish-time output declares it (`reads`, the kinds of
 * directory it reads) and is ordered AFTER that writer. `derive:publish`
 * sorts by those edges and refuses a cycle.
