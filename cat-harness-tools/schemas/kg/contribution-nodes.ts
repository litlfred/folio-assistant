/**
 * Contributions as KG nodes: a harness's QA checkers and pipeline-plugin
 * implementations, each a node in a graph of its own.
 *
 * One graph per contribution type, and a folio sees the nodes of the
 * instances it depends on. `loadContributions` registers them through the
 * same `orderedDependencies` walk it finds `contributes` modules by.
 *
 * ## What a node names, and what it does not
 *
 * The DATA is the node: which criterion a checker answers, which slot a plugin
 * fills. The CODE is referenced as `path#Export`, relative to the CONTRIBUTING
 * instance's root, and the export is a TABLE keyed by the node's `criterion`
 * or `slot`, so `tsc` checks every entry against the contract it fills
 * (`PipelinePlugins`, the checker signature). The node says the entry exists,
 * discoverable without loading code.
 *
 * A contribution's code is its OWN: an `instance:` prefix is refused. A slot
 * whose implementation lives in a lower layer is wrapped by a module in the
 * contributing instance, as the science layer's `plugin-slots.ts` does.
 *
 * A LEAF: Zod only.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/schemas/contribution-nodes
