  Scenario: A declared kind is loaded with the file that declared it
    Given a checkout whose instance alpha declares the kind "widget" in typologies/widget.json

  Scenario: A kind only the inspected checkout declares is known
    Given an inspected checkout declaring "l6-contributed" and a module checkout declaring nothing
    When a registry over both is asked for "l6-contributed"
    Then it has it
    And a registry over the module checkout alone does not

  Scenario: A kind repeated by a later checkout is shadowed and reported
    Given the inspected checkout declaring "l6-shared" as content and a later checkout declaring it as derived

  @test:schemas/kg/graph-typology-node.test.ts::several_checkouts,_in_precedence_order_(kg-separation_lesson_6)::defaultTypologyRoots:_$REPO_ROOT_alone;_else_the_inspected_checkout_first,_then_the_module's
  Scenario: The default roots are $REPO_ROOT alone, else the inspected checkout then the module's
    Given an inspected checkout, the module's own checkout, and an empty directory
    When the default typology roots are computed
    Then with REPO_ROOT set they are that checkout alone
    And from the inspected checkout they are the inspected checkout, then the module's
    And from the module's checkout, or from a directory holding no instance, they are the module's alone

  Scenario: Reading a declaration registers the kinds of its own checkout first
    Given a registry over a checkout that does not declare "g7ls-contributed"
    And an instance fhir-harness in another checkout whose directory uses "g7ls-contributed", declared there
    When fhir-harness's declaration is read with that registry
    Then it reads with the name "fhir-harness"
    And the registry now has "g7ls-contributed"
    And reading it with a registry of no checkout throws 'unknown graph typology "g7ls-contributed"'

  Scenario: A lazy roots function is called once, on first use
    Given a registry built with a function returning a checkout that declares "l6-lazy"
    Then the function has not been called
    When the registry is asked whether it has "l6-lazy"
    Then it has, and the function has been called once
    And reading its roots returns that checkout without calling the function again
