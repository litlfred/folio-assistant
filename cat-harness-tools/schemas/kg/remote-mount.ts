/**
 * REMOTE MOUNTS — a harness, and its dependency closure, read from another
 * repository at a pinned commit and laid down as declared directories.
 *
 * @module schemas/remote-mount
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * Bean `0mpw`, under the KG-subscriptions epic `fnx4` and the separation arc
 * `7x5n`. The owner's rulings, 2026-10-06:
 *
 * - **no git submodules, ever**, and **no `.deps/`** — a dot directory collides
 *   with GitHub's conventions and with this repository's own dot-prefix guard;
 * - a remote mount is a **declared directory with a remote source**, pinned to
 *   a full 40-character SHA (`SubgraphSource` → `kind: "remote"`);
 * - the **defaults live in the harness's own declaration** — which of its
 *   directories a downstream mounts, and where — so a downstream names only
 *   the harness and its pin ({@link MountDefaultsSchema});
 * - a downstream **may override** those defaults, matched on **id** (the
 *   instance's name, then a directory's id), never on path
 *   ({@link MountOverrideSchema});
 * - mounts are resolved **transitively** across the dependency closure;
 * - code arrives through the mounted code directories, so imports resolve
 *   through mounted paths.
 *
 * ## Tools: a chosen set, runnable (bean `mo75` G3)
 *
 * `overrides.<instance>.tools` names Tools by id, and the mount brings each
 * one RUNNABLE. The owner's rulings, 2026-10-24 (decision card,
 * https://github.com/litlfred/cat-harness-tools/issues/744):
 *
 * 1. **A Tool brings its definition AND its implementation**, each with its
 *    import closure: the definition is `<tools dir>/<id>/<id>.ts` in the
 *    instance that declares it (the folder convention, `tool-folders.ts`);
 *    the implementation is the module its `invoke` names — `inProcess.module`
 *    in the declarer or an instance that needs it (`resolveImplementingPath`'s
 *    rule), or the script a `bun run cat <key>` command resolves to through
 *    the instances' `checkoutScripts`.
 * 2. **One closure walker**: bootstrap-tools' `importClosure`
 *    (`scripts/check-closure.ts`), the walk `check:tools-closure` itself runs.
 * 3. **Directory granularity**: every DECLARED directory the closure touches
 *    is mounted whole — the most specific one, so a nested directory mounts
 *    alone. The lock is unchanged: it records directories, as it always has,
 *    and never a single file.
 *
 * With `tools` named anywhere in a mount entry, the entry's instances mount
 * what the closure touches plus the directories their override names, and
 * not their default list; a `whole` instance stays whole.
 *
 * ## Hydrated: metadata first (bean `mo75` G2)
 *
 * `hydrated: true` on a mount entry, or on `overrides.<instance>`, mounts each
 * chosen directory as ONE file: that subgraph's published
 * `index.hydrated.jsonld` at the pin (`SubgraphSource` → `kind: "hydrated"`),
 * so a downstream can read what `tools/` or `skills/` holds before it decides
 * which of it to materialise. No code arrives, so the instance is not laid
 * down as an instance: no `<name>.json` is written (discovery would otherwise
 * read every absent directory as empty — `dh4f`), the lock marks it
 * `hydrated`, and {@link mountedInstanceRoots} never offers it to the overlay
 * as somewhere to import from.
 *
 * The file is read from the pin's git tree when a commit carries it, and
 * otherwise from the pin's subgraph index PACKAGE (bean `mo75` G2b; owner,
 * 2026-10-24, option A: published per pin in a package, never committed and
 * never generated at mount). Such a directory's lock entry records the
 * package's URL and sha256 ({@link LockedDirectorySchema}`.package`).
 *
 * ## Why the default path is the harness's HOME path
 *
 * A mounted instance lands, by default, at the path it has in its own
 * repository (`livesAt.path`), relative to the DOWNSTREAM instance's root —
 * where its lock sits, and for a folio repository the checkout root. Two things then hold with no further machinery:
 * `instanceRootsIn` — which scans a checkout one level deep — finds every
 * mounted sibling, so `needs` resolves exactly as it does in the monorepo; and
 * a relative import from one mounted instance into another
 * (`../../cat-harness/schemas/…`) finds the file it names, because the
 * instances keep their relative layout. Moving one instance by override is
 * allowed, and the lock records where it went, but it is the override that
 * takes responsibility for imports that climb out of it.
 *
 * ## What the lock is, and why it is not the declaration
 *
 * The declaration says WHAT is mounted (a harness and a pin). The lock
 * ({@link MountLockSchema}) says what the closure RESOLVED to at that pin —
 * every instance reached, the commit each was read at (a gitlink in the tree
 * pins a dependency in another repository), and each directory's tree digest.
 * The check compares the disk against the lock, and the lock's pins against the
 * declaration, so "mounted", "missing" and "could not determine" are three
 * answers and never one.
