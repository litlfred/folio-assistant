/**
 * The NODES of a node kind, found where its typologies say they are.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/schemas/node-kind-nodes
 * @graphNode none — a reader over declared directories; it defines no schema
 *
 * A kind's page lists its own nodes and its subclasses'. The node-kind index
 * says which typologies hold each kind, and each layer's `<instance>.json`
 * says which of its directories have that typology; this joins the two and
 * reads the files.
 *
 * A file belongs to a kind when the kind ACCEPTS its `$schema` — same name,
 * same major, no newer minor (`acceptsSchemaTag`) — so a node written under an
 * earlier minor still appears. JSON nodes carry the tag as `$schema`; Markdown
 * nodes (todos) carry it in their front matter.
 *
 * Each node is filed under the HARNESS that holds it — the layer whose
 * declaration names the directory — with a path relative to that layer's
 * root and without its extension: `<declaring>/<kind>/<harness>/<path>`. A
 * repository-scoped directory sits OUTSIDE its declaring layer's root, so
 * its nodes are addressed relative to the repository.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT read
 *
 * - **A directory whose content is off the checkout** — a `source` other than
 *   `directory`, e.g. beans and todos kept at the tip of a state branch, which
 *   moves without a commit. The state viewer renders those nodes live. A
 *   NESTED entry (`within`) inherits its parent's source.
 * - Nothing else is skipped. A kind with no typology (a layer declaration)
 *   is found by its NAME RULE instead: see `NAME_RULE_KINDS` in `node-kind-index.ts`.
