/**
 * The two files a NAMED SUBGRAPH publishes — `index.jsonld` (referenced) and
 * `index.hydrated.jsonld` (dereferenced) — as one schema with two forms.
 *
 * The contract is `skills/kg/kg-core/kg-export.md` §"Named subgraphs — one
 * IRI, two files, framed from one graph". This module is what a consumer
 * validates against; `scripts/gen-subgraph-jsonld.ts` validates every file
 * against it before writing.
 *
 * ## One base with the harness
 *
 * A harness instance IS a named subgraph, and a subgraph is a directory of a
 * declared graph — both what {@link GraphNodeDirectoryShape} describes. The
 * subgraph node PICKS that shape: `path` and the label fields come from it
 * unchanged. Two fields are not carried, each replaced by its JSON-LD form:
 *
 * - `id` — the node's identity is its `@id`, the directory IRI.
 * - `graphTypologies` — the KG carries kinds as `holdsGraph` LINKS to
 *   GraphTypology nodes, not a literal list.
 *
 * ## The two forms differ only in what a member IS
 *
 * - In the INDEX a direct member is a pointer — `@id`, `@type` and its label —
 *   and a child subgraph is its IRI, nothing more.
 * - In the HYDRATED file a member is the whole node, and a child subgraph is
 *   the child's own subgraph node, nested, with ITS members inline. So
 *   "every node of `skills/sdlc`" is one fetch.
 *
 * Both have the directory IRI as root `@id`, and both name the shared context
 * by URL: an inline `@context` object is rejected by the type, because the
 * contract says the context is never inlined.
 *
 * @graphNode schema

 *   and the XML is the source file of its own declared graph rather than a
