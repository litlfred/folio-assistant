/**
 * reference-direction.ts — does this PROSE reference follow the dependency arrow?
 *
 * If A depends on B (directly or through a chain), nothing in B may reference
 * A: B is lower and must not know what sits on top of it.
 * `bootstrap-tools/schemas/graph.test.ts` enforces this for ONE instance
 * (`bootstrap/`); this module is the same invariant over every declared
 * instance.
 *
 * ## One arrow — this does NOT recompute direction
 *
 * An import and a sentence are the SAME arrow. Direction is
 * {@link directionOf} in `layer-direction.ts`, shared with `check:partition`
 * (import edges) and `kg-detangle` (KG edges); this module asks the identical
 * question of a NAME OCCURRENCE in a file.
 *
 * ## Five verdicts
 *
 * `allowed`, `exempt`, `wrong-direction`, `names-repository` and
 * `undetermined` — mirroring `layer-direction.ts`, plus `names-repository`,
 * since a name (unlike an import path) can name a repository.
 *
 * `undetermined` means the tool declined to judge — never clean. Two things
 * land there:
 *
 *   - an instance that declares no `needs` (absent is nobody-has-said, never
 *     "may reach nothing" and never "may reach anything"), which
 *     `allowedFromNeeds` already reports; and
 *   - a bare mention of a name that is ALSO the repository's name, with
 *     nothing in the occurrence to tell the two apart (below).
 *
 * ## The repository-name collision, decided per occurrence
 *
 * An instance rooted AT the repository root shares its name with the
 * repository and the product, and every relative path resolves inside its
 * root, so the name alone cannot tell them apart. The occurrence usually can:
 * a URL is an address and `<owner>/<name>` is a repository slug. So
 * {@link NameCollision} is decided per OCCURRENCE:
 *
 *   - `"instance"` — the occurrence points INTO a directory the colliding
 *     instance declares, so it is a reference to the instance and is judged
 *     by the arrow like any other, `wrong-direction` included;
 *   - `"repository"` — it names the repository or the product address, and
 *     {@link ReferenceVerdict}'s `names-repository` says exactly that;
 *   - `"unknown"` — a bare prose mention, with no path and no URL. It stays
 *     `undetermined`; the ambiguity is real.
 *
 * The resolver is passed IN rather than derived here, so this module stays
 * free of paths and its tests need no tree on disk. Which occurrence shapes
 * map to which collision is the CALLER's question, because it is the caller
 * that read the declaration.
 *
 * @module schemas/reference-direction
 * @graphNode none — a classification function: it defines no schema
