/**
 * Cross-folio dependency schema for folio-assistant instances.
 *
 * A folio-assistant instance can depend on other instances for content,
 * skills, and translation resolution. Dependencies are declared in
 * `harness.config.json` under `dependencies.folioAssistant` and walked
 * depth-first in listed order, overlaying content and skills on the root —
 * later overlays earlier, as in FHIR/SUSHI.
 *
 * ## The pin differs from SUSHI
 *
 * SUSHI names a dependency as `packageId: version`;
 * {@link FolioAssistantDependencySchema} names a git `ref` that DEFAULTS TO THE
 * DEFAULT BRANCH, which can change silently. A SHA may stage, only a
 * published semver version may publish:
 * [`directory-conventions`](../skills/kg/kg-core/directory-conventions.md)
 * §"Pinning a reference — a SHA may stage, only a version may publish",
 * enforced by `bun run cat check:published-refs`. The full scheme
 * is `cat-harness/docs/proposals/instance-versioning.md`.
 *
 * ## What gets resolved across dependencies
 *
 * | Resource | Resolved? | How |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | PO translations | ✅ | `translations/<locale>/`, fallback chain step 4 — the only path with a live consumer (`pipeline/po-resolve.ts`) |
 * | Kind headings | ✅ | `kindHeading` in `schemas/content/translation.ts`: English on each block-kind node, other locales in its owner's `translations/<lang>/block-kinds.po` |
 * | Skills | ✅ | {@link resolveSkillDirs} reads each instance's DECLARATION, and `LOCAL_PACKAGES` in `src/tools/skill-fetch.ts` is built from it, so a dependency's packages are served. Two nearby call sites stay root-only on purpose — see its docs |
 * | Declared directories | ✅ | {@link declarationChain} + `resolveDirectories`, materialised by {@link materialiseDeclaredDirectories} |
 * | Block kinds | ✅ | {@link loadContributions} → `schemas/content/contributions.ts` |
 * | Adapters | ✅ | {@link loadContributions}, as a module specifier |
 * | MCP tools | ✅ | {@link loadContributions}, as registrar callbacks |
 * | Content blocks | ❌ | no resolver |
 * | QA criteria | ❌ | criterion definitions are root-only |
 *

 * must say where its store is. That duplication is unavoidable; leaving it
 * unchecked would not be.
 *
 * ## What stays

 * then *"i want to adopt the sushi/fhir IG(/npm?) versioning dependencies for
 * computing overlays. SHAs are for provenance, digital signing, staging. we
 * need both, different needs."*
 *
 * Before this, `needs` and `dependencies` were two relations that nothing
 * reconciled: `needs` drove `dependency-order`'s sort and `harness-tiles`'
 * navbar spine, while the skill and content overlay read config
 * `dependencies` — and **exactly one instance in the repository declared
 * one**. So the whole `smart-*` stack had a correct navbar spine, a correct
 * topological order, green gates, and **not one skill crossing a layer
 * boundary**. An IG instance could not reach `ig-build-pipeline`, the skill
 * governing how its own IG is built. Bean `5kn6`.
 *
 * That was invisible precisely because `needs` being right LOOKS like the
 * stack being wired.
 *
 * ## The two tiers, and why a derived edge carries no version
 *
 * `instance-versioning.md` §3.3: a SHA may stage, only a version publishes.
 * An edge between two instances in ONE checkout is a staging-tier reference —
 * the consumer has the repository, so a path resolves it, and a version would
 * be asserting a published identity that §3.1 says most instances should not
 * have. So a derived dependency carries `path` and **no `version`**, and that
 * is a statement rather than an omission: it is not publishable, and
 * `check:published-refs` is what stops one reaching an external consumer.
 *
 * An edge to something OUTSIDE the checkout cannot be derived — a name gives
 * no git URL and no version — so it stays authored in the config. That is the
 * division of labour: **`needs` states the stack, the config states what a
 * name cannot carry.**
 *
 * ## A name that resolves to nothing is REPORTED, never dropped
 *
 * It comes back in `unresolved`. Silently skipping it would make "this layer
 * is external" and "this layer is misspelled" the same observation, and only
 * one of them is fine.

 *
 * ## Why this exists — the arrow the mirrors had backwards
 *
 * Until placement PR0 (bean `ejye`), `cat-harness.json` carried 19
 * `scope: "repository"` entries naming its DEPENDENTS' directories —
 * the content core's `skills/`, the IRIS replica's `library/`, … — so that a
 * corpus-wide tool asking the platform for "every library" got every library.
 * Every one of those owners `needs` cat-harness, so the platform was naming
 * its users: the wrong-way arrow `cmsl` measured, and 5 of the 19 had already
 * drifted from the owner's own id. The owner's ruling (2026-09-30, round 3):
 * **the checkout aggregates.** The root instance `needs` every staged
 * instance and declares the checkout-level state it physically holds; a
 * corpus-wide tool resolves over the root's overlay; the platform names no
 * folio.
 *
 * ## Why per instance, and not one `resolveDirectories` over one long chain
 *
 * `resolveDirectories` overrides BY ID, which is right along one dependency
 * line and wrong across siblings: the DAK layer declares `processes` at
 * `methodologies/processes/`, and resolving it in the same chain as
 * cat-harness would REPLACE cat-harness's `processes` rather than add to it.
 * Each instance answers for itself through its own chain, keeping the entries
 * it owns (`own`, or a default seeded in its own tree); the union, de-duplicated
 * by absolute path, is the checkout. A diamond reaches an instance twice and
 * contributes it once.
 *
 * ## The falsifier it carries (cmsl)
 *
 * A checkout whose root instance does NOT stage an instance sees less — a
 * split checkout running against one folio sees that folio's dependencies
 * only. That is the intended behaviour: the tool sees what the checkout
 * contains, not what the platform remembers having been next to.

 * its implementation by an instance-relative path — a Tool's
 * `invoke.inProcess.module` (`src/tools/x.ts`), a criterion's `source_file`
 * (`pipeline/x.ts`). The code those paths name is moving to the layer
 * above, and writing that layer's name into the harness
 * would be a lower layer naming a higher one, which `check:reference-direction`
 * grades. So the path stays as written, and is resolved against the instance
 * that implements the definition — found the way the arrow already runs, from
 * the implementer's `needs` to the definer, never the reverse.
 *
 * ## Direct, not transitive
 *
 * {@link checkoutDependentsOf} is transitive: every folio in the checkout
 * depends on the harness eventually, and any of them may hold a
 * `scripts/x.ts`. Only an instance that names the definer in its OWN `needs`
 * has taken it on directly, which is the relation "implements" can mean.
 *
 * The checkout's aggregate root is excluded even though it `needs`
 * everything: its directory CONTAINS the definer, so a relative path under it
 * would be a different path, not the same one somewhere else.

 * ## Read from the declaration, not from a literal
 *
 * This used to be `join(dep.rootPath, "skills")`. `AGENTS.md` is explicit that
 * *"hardcoding a path is how a skill goes missing the moment the layout
 * moves"*, and an instance may put its knowledge graph anywhere — in THIS
 * repository the declared id is `cat-harness` while the path is `skills/`,
 * which is exactly the id/path split the declaration exists to absorb.
 *
 * ## Why not `resolveDirectories`
 *
 * Because it answers a different question, and asking it this one silently
 * loses dependencies — it overrides **by id**, so a dependency and a root that
 * both declare `cat-harness` collapse to the root's entry alone. {@link
 * ownDirectories} resolves per instance instead, which is what an overlay
 * needs. That mismatch is the likeliest reason this function reached for a
 * literal in the first place, and why it sat with no caller.
 *
 * ## `provides` still opts a dependency out
 *
 * A dependency declaring `provides` without `"skills"` contributes none, and
 * that is kept deliberately: it is the only way an instance can depend on
 * another for content or translations without inheriting its skills.
 *
 * ## Its consumer, and the two call sites that are still wrong for the job
 *
 * `LOCAL_PACKAGES` in `src/tools/skill-fetch.ts` is built from this — so a
 * DEPENDENCY's skill packages are served, which is the overlay `AGENTS.md`
 * records as outstanding Phase 0.1 work.
 *
 * Two nearby call sites deliberately still do NOT use it, because each would
 * break in a specific way:
 *
 * 1. **`kgDirectories` in `scripts/known-skills.ts` composes IDS.** Its
 *    `path` field becomes a repo-relative skill id (`skillMdDirs`). Feeding a
 *    dependency's directory in would mint ids that look repo-relative but
 *    resolve into another checkout — wrong in a way that reads as correct.
 * 2. **`kgRoots(root)[0]` is taken as "the root's graph"** by
 *    `src/tools/workflow.ts` and `src/workflow/gate.ts`. Overlay order is
 *    deepest-dependency-FIRST, so making that function overlay-aware would
 *    hand those callers a dependency's role graph instead of the root's.
