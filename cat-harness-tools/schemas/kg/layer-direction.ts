/**
 * layer-direction.ts — is this edge pointing the way its layers allow?
 *
 * ONE answer to one question, asked by two tools:
 *
 * - `scripts/partition/engine.ts` (`check:partition`) asks it of every import
 *   between modules, where the layers are the repos a module is assigned to.
 * - `skills/kg/graph-management/kg-detangle.ts` asks it of every outbound edge of a
 *   candidate group, where the layers are the instances a node lives in and
 *   the allowed relation is each instance's declared `needs`.
 *
 * ## What it decides, and what it refuses to
 *
 * It decides DIRECTION and nothing else. An edge from layer A to layer B is
 * wrong-direction exactly when B is not among what A declares it may reach
 * and no permit names that edge — mechanical, re-checkable from two
 * declarations and a list.
 *
 * It does NOT decide whether a permitted edge is a restatement or essential:
 * that needs judgement, and `detangle.ts` makes the carve an adjudication.
 *
 * ## Four verdicts, not a boolean
 *
 * `allowed`, `permitted`, `wrong-direction` and `undetermined`. An instance
 * with no `needs` has not declared its layer, so its edges are UNDETERMINED,
 * never "may reach nothing" and never "may reach anything" (`cat-harness.ts`,
 * `needs`).
 *
 * Self is not implicit: a caller whose layers may reach themselves says so in
 * `allowed`, so the rule a reader checks is the rule that ran.
 *
 * @module schemas/layer-direction
 * @graphNode none — a classification function: it defines no schema
