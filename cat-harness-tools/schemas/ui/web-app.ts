/**
 * A web app a layer holds as source and publishes as a page of its own: one
 * `web-app.json` at the root of a directory of kind `web-app`.
 *
 * @graphNode schema
 * @module schemas/web-app
 *
 * ## Why a kind, and not an app per repository
 *
 * Owner, 2026-11-11 (cards Q-GAME-5 A and Q-GAME-7 A): a content layer that
 * carries an interactive app (the GDHCN onboarding game in smart-trust) must
 * not become a harness to publish it, and the one-off route the VaxLink app
 * used (`web/` + its own `publish.sh` + `site.build.keep`) is retired. So the
 * harness owns the kind and one visualiser over it (`apps`, rendered by the
 * `web-app-build` Tool), and a layer only declares the directory.
 *
 * | field | what |
 * |---|---|
 * | `id` | the app's URL segment under the visualiser: `<locale>/<harness>/apps/<id>/` |
 * | `title`, `description` | what the `apps` index lists |
 * | `build` | how to install and build it, and where the build lands (`dist/` by default) |
 * | `chrome` | always `none`: the app draws its own frame, so its pages carry the navbar opt-out |
 * | `locales` | the languages it ships, BCP 47; the site's locales are the target |
 * | `contentFrom` | the layer's own directory ids it reads at build time, so a change there rebuilds it |
 * | `sizeBudgetMB` | the size its build may reach before the size review flags it |
 * | `license`, `source` | an SPDX id and where the code came from, for a copied app |
 *
 * ## Loaded only when opened
 *
 * The app is its own route. No other page embeds it or loads its scripts: a
 * tile, an IG page or a journey links to it, and only a reader who opens the
 * route downloads it. Inside the app, splitting heavy parts behind a dynamic
 * `import()` is the app's own business.
