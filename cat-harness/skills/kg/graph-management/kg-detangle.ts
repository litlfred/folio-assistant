/**
 * Run the detangle criterion over this repository's knowledge graph.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run kg:detangle            # every candidate group
 *   bun run kg:detangle --group X  # one group, with its worklist
 *   bun run kg:detangle --json
 *
 * ## What counts as an edge, and why the list is short on purpose
 *
 * Four extractors, each of which reads a declaration the repository already
 * makes rather than guessing at meaning:
 *
 *   - `md-link`       a relative markdown link between two graph files
 *   - `bpmn-skill`    `<bootstrap.processes:skill ref="…">` on an activity
 *   - `json-skill`    a skill name in `roles.json` or a package manifest
 *   - `ts-import`     a relative import between schema modules
 *
 * There is deliberately NO full-text extractor. A skill that merely MENTIONS
 * another by name in prose is not depending on it, and counting prose
 * mentions would make every package that cites `AGENTS.md`'s examples look
 * tangled into all of them. Under-counting shows up as a group that looks
 * cleaner than it is; the adjudicator is told which extractors ran, so that
 * limit is visible rather than silent.
 *
 * A reference to a node outside the scanned set is a DANGLING reference, and
 * it is reported separately. It is not an outbound edge: counting it as one
 * would make a group with a broken link look entangled, which is a different
 * finding calling for a different fix.

 * The nodes of one scanned directory — asked of git, not of the disk.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a bare walk any more
 *
 * A bare walk skips dot-prefixed entries and nothing else, so it counts
 * whatever happens to be on the machine. On 2026-09-26 that stopped being
 * theoretical: `check:published-packages` (bean `rsi6`) runs `bun install`
 * inside `cat-harness/schemas/block-qa-schema`, and the moment it did, this
 * scan's answer for `cat-harness/schemas` went from **227** to **1441** —
 * 1214 files of a dependency tree and a build directory, counted as
 * knowledge-graph nodes and pinned into a committed sidecar, which
 * `gen-uml-overview` then republished as `1441 | 0.96 | 25 | 4`.
 *
 * Measured four ways on one tree, with this module's own `EXT`: bare walk
 * 1441, excluding `node_modules/` 228, also excluding `dist/` 227,
 * `git ls-files` 227.
 *
 * **The sharp part is that it was order-dependent WITHIN a single run.** That
 * install happens at line 823 of `code-quality-gates.yml` and
 * `kg:detangle:check` at line 663, so a runner measures 227 while a developer
 * container that has already run the gate set measures 1441 — and the two
 * disagree about a number that is committed. A measurement whose value depends
 * on which gate ran first is not a measurement of the repository.
 *
 * This was the THIRTEENTH instance of `xd1g`'s class and the first outside
 * `scripts/`, which is why that bean's survey — a syntactic filter over
 * `scripts/*.ts` — could not have found it.
 *
 * ## `undefined` is not `[]`
 *
 * {@link gitCorpus} returns `undefined` when git could not answer and `[]` when
 * git looked and there is nothing. Collapsing them is the `dh4f` shape —
 * reporting a clean corpus nobody read.
 *
 * But there are **three** cases here, not two, because `gitCorpus` also answers
 * `undefined` for a directory that is not there — and an absent directory is a
 * DETERMINED empty, not an unknown. Found immediately: `SCAN` still names
 * `cat-harness/src/skills`, which #760 removed, so the first version of this
 * function reported *"git could not enumerate 1 directory"* about a directory
 * whose answer is perfectly known. That is a could-not-determine manufactured
 * out of a fact, which is as bad as the reverse.
 *
 * So:
 *
 *   absent      -> `[]`, and recorded in {@link absentScanTargets}. A declared
 *                  scan target that does not exist is `dh4f` itself — a
 *                  consumer scanning nothing and reporting a clean run over it
 *                  — so it is REPORTED rather than silently skipped, and left
 *                  for a person to remove from `SCAN`.
 *   git refused -> a bare {@link walk}, recorded in {@link corpusFallbacks},
 *                  because a measurement pinned from a bare walk counts
 *                  whatever is on the machine and must be legible as such.
 *   git answers -> that list, filtered to {@link EXT} and to the dot-prefix
 *                  rule `walk` applied.
 *
 * Neither is a failure. `gates` must stay runnable where git cannot be asked,
 * and a stale `SCAN` entry is a person's edit, not this script's to make.

 * `--gate-direction` — the CROSS-INSTANCE wrong-direction gate. Bean `p11x`,
 * the owner's Option 2 ruling of 2026-09-30.
 *
 * ## What it grades, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * Everything else this script reports is **pinned, not graded**: the carve is
 * an adjudication a person makes (`detangle.ts`, "taste is a declared step"),
 * so `--check` fails on a STALE or ORPHANED sidecar and never on a number
 * being wrong. **That ruling stands and this flag does not touch it.**
 *
 * The one number that is not taste is this one. A module's BUCKET is a
 * judgement; an import pointing at an instance that declares a dependency on
 * you is a contradiction between two declarations, and no amount of taste
 * makes it consistent. So the direction count is graded and the rest is not,
 * and the two live behind DIFFERENT FLAGS with different npm scripts and
 * different CI steps — because a reader looking at a red run has to be able
 * to tell "somebody moved a file and did not re-pin" from "somebody inverted
 * the layering", and a third behaviour on `--check` would report both as one.
 *
 * ## Why this axis is here rather than in `check:partition`
 *
 * `check:partition` resolves its ROOT to `<checkout>/cat-harness`, so the
 * wrong-direction count it prints is scoped to ONE instance and is silent
 * about edges between already-extracted siblings. `bf5l` measured the
 * discriminator: with `cat-harness/schemas/intake.ts` importing
 * `folio-assistant-core` in place, `check:instance-graph` and
 * `check:partition` were both green and this script reported 1. A node's
 * layer HERE is the instance it lives in, which is why it can see the axis at
 * all.
 *
 * ## It writes nothing, and that is load-bearing twice over
 *
 * A gate that mutates the tree it is judging is not a gate, and this one runs
 * in CI. It also means the flag does not inherit `ymsu` — that defect is
 * `bun test` repairing a SIDECAR that a later gate then compares against
 * itself, and a live-computed edge count has no sidecar to repair. `ymsu` is
 * open and untouched (the owner accepted that cost when ruling Option 2);
 * what is claimed here is only that this particular flag is outside its
 * mechanism, which is checkable: nothing below reads a committed file.
