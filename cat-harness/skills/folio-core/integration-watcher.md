# integration-watcher (abstract parent)

A concrete watcher (this skill's child) **watches incoming activity**
on a focused content axis — proofs, derivation discipline,
compute-chain wiring, voice, structure, or any future domain — runs a
domain QA pipeline on every detected change, queues findings, attempts
auto-discharge where possible, and asks the author for the rest.

Concrete children fill the slots below for one QA axis each. Typical
axes (a project picks the ones it needs):

| Child | Domain | Goal |
|-------|--------|------|
| `proof-integration-watcher` | Proof QA (narrative + formal layer) | No bare gaps, no axiom growth, formal-layer compile check, no naked conjectures with provable scaffolding |
| `canonical-watcher` | Derivation discipline | No undisclosed free parameters, no numerology, no coefficient fits (per the project's derivation-discipline statement) |
| `compute-integration-watcher` | Cross-layer compute wiring | Every provable/derived block has a probe + production consumer |
| `detangler-integration-watcher` | Structural QA (graph + density) | No new forward refs, sections within the block-count band, no new cross-chapter forward edges |
| `one-voice-integration-watcher` | Content-block voice + fit + framework | Scholarly voice (narrative + proof bodies), zero AI-slop, block fit to section/chapter, canonical-vs-deprecated notation; persists per-block `<block>.qa.json` audit reports (multi-reviewer, hash-keyed staleness) |
| `devils-advocate-watcher` | Adversarial "why is this wrong" review | For every block + formal sibling, construct the strongest referee objection; multiple adversarial lenses + adjudicator; emits `da-*` sidecars; gated by the refutation-scope rule + corpus-grep checklist |

## Domain slots (every child must fill)

| Slot | Where in this parent | What the child provides |
|------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **A. Goal statement** | top of child | One-paragraph driving function |
| **B. §3 trigger filter** | §3 | Domain-specific patterns: which file paths / commit subjects / PR comment keywords trigger the §4 pipeline |
| **C. §4b dispatch table** | §4b | Which specialist skills/scripts to invoke per event, in parallel |
| **D. §4c finding taxonomy** | §4c | The set of violation/finding kinds the domain recognizes |
| **E. §4d discharge bands** | §4d | Domain-specific examples of Auto-discharge / Author-assist / Defer findings |
| **F. §4e author-ask templates** | §4e | Domain-specific question forms (numbered choices, file/line citations) |
| **G. §5a backlog discovery** | §5a | What to enumerate from the codebase at backlog-sweep time |
| **H. §5b prioritisation** | §5b | Domain-specific ranking rule for the backlog |
| **I. §6 invariants** | §6 | Per-commit checks the watcher enforces on its own branch |

Everything else — §1, §2, §4a, §4f, §5c-§5m, §7-§9, anti-patterns,
checklist — is defined here and inherited verbatim.

## 0. Invocation as `/integration-watch [args]`

This parent skill is **abstract — `user_invocable: false`**.
The `/integration-watch` slash command is implemented by
[`integration-watch`](integration-watch.md), which acts as the single
entry point and dispatches to one or more concrete children. Keeping
the dispatcher and the abstract parent separate avoids duplicating
the slash-command routing.

This section documents the **invocation grammar** that the dispatcher
must implement; the parent only describes shared mechanics that every
concrete watcher inherits.

When the user invokes `/integration-watch` directly the dispatcher:

| User input | Behaviour |
|------------|-----------|
| `/integration-watch` (no arg) | **Ask which.** Use `AskUserQuestion` capped at 4 chips, role-gated. Do NOT auto-pick. |
| `/integration-watch <axis>` | Dispatch the named child watcher |
| `/integration-watch all` or comma/space list | Dispatch **all** named watchers in parallel — each gets its own Monitor, its own queue/ledger, its own PR subscription set (deduped). |
| `/integration-watch <unknown>` | List the available children, reject the unknown name, re-prompt via `AskUserQuestion`. |

**No-arg full-context preamble (per §4e rule):** before the
`AskUserQuestion`, write a short chat message naming each available
watcher and its one-line QA axis, then surface the structured chip set.

## 0a. Repo-owner preferences (binding for all watchers)

Per [`interaction-modality`](interaction-modality.md) the repo owner types with
difficulty and prefers a small set of binding behavioural defaults.
These override the historical watcher defaults — every child inherits
them.

1. **One branch / one PR for related things.** Group many related
   fixes (especially backlog items) into a single branch + single PR.
   Don't open small per-item PRs. See §5j step 1 ("Cluster
   aggressively") and §5g step 5 for the merge-prompt sequencing.
2. **Don't spawn more than one agent at a time without explicit
   consent.** Sequential foreground work is the default; parallel
   agent dispatch requires affirmative user approval per batch. See
   §5m for the full rule and the narrow exceptions (read-only tool
   calls in one response are still fine; agent spawns are the
   constraint).
3. **Group a lot — backlog batches are large by default.** When the
   backlog has 4-20 related items in the same finding bucket, do them
   all in one branch, stacked as multiple commits if they need
   different commit messages. Don't split into N small branches.

These rules supersede any "default to parallel" / "one PR per item"
framing earlier in this document. When in doubt: cluster more,
dispatch fewer agents, ask before parallelising.

## 0c. Sibling coordination

Per [`coordinate`](coordinate.md), on coordinating intent with sibling
branches:

- **At workplan start** (new branch / new tranche), list active
  sibling PRs via `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` (open) and
  recently-updated `claude/*` branches via `mcp__github__list_branches`.
  Identify siblings whose scope overlaps (same chapter, same source
  file, same domain).
- **Post a 1-3 sentence intent comment** on each genuinely-overlapping
  sibling PR. Format: "Starting <theme> on <branch>; will touch
  <file or scope>; flag conflicts to me." Don't comment on every
  sibling; don't make noise on the PR. Skip if no overlap.
- **Inform siblings of critical findings** as they land. If you
  discover something a sibling is waiting on, post on the sibling PR
  proactively — don't wait for them to step on the rake.
- **During idle (per §0b 5-minute trigger)** ALSO check sibling PRs
  for coordination updates that affect your branch's scope.
  `mcp__github__pull_request_read get_comments` on each watched
  sibling; new comments addressed to "all watchers" or referencing
  your branch's keywords are actionable backlog items.

This rule supersedes the historical "post on the PR only when asked"
framing — proactive coordination on workplan start + during idle is
now the default.

## 0d. AskUserQuestion accessibility

Per [`interaction-modality`](interaction-modality.md) and its `low-dexterity`
profile, which defaults `AskUserQuestion` to `multiSelect: true`: the repo
owner types with difficulty.

- **Default `multiSelect: true`.** Single-select forces the user to
  type "1, 2" as free text when multiple options apply. Most watcher
  decision points are not mutually exclusive, so multi-select is the
  safer default.
- **Prefix questions with 🟡** to mark the agent as waiting / blocked
  on input. Consistent use lets the user scan chat history and find
  every pending decision.
- **Phrase questions to allow optional notes**: "Pick all that apply;
  add 'Other' with a free-text note if needed."
- Single-select is OK only for genuinely mutually-exclusive actions.


## Where each section lives

This skill was 1281 lines. An agent reads it before acting, every time, and at
that length it skims — so the parts that apply to one phase are beside it
rather than in here. **Nothing was deleted and no section was renumbered**,
because children cite the parent by number (`parent §4b`, `parent §5m`) and
those citations have to keep resolving.

| § | what | where |
|---|---|---|
| `0`, `0a`, `0c`, `0d` | invocation, and the policies binding on every watcher | **here** — read before you start |
| `0b` | idle-time backlog policy (5-minute trigger) | [`integration-watcher/idle-backlog.md`](integration-watcher/idle-backlog.md) |
| `1`–`4` | setup, active watching, trigger filter, per-event QA pipeline | [`integration-watcher/lifecycle.md`](integration-watcher/lifecycle.md) |
| `5` | idle backlog sweep, and the handover issue template | [`integration-watcher/idle-backlog.md`](integration-watcher/idle-backlog.md) |
| `6`–`9`, anti-patterns, checklist | invariants, output style, integration, role gating | **here** |

**Running a watcher:** read this file, then `lifecycle.md`. You reach
`idle-backlog.md` only when the queue is empty and the idle trigger fires.

## 6. Goal-driven invariants

Children fill **Slot I** with the domain's invariant checks. The parent
enforces this pattern: every invariant is checked before every
own-branch commit; failure blocks the commit, queues the violation as
`critical`, and asks the author.

## 7. Output style

- One line per event when nothing changed (`<sha>  no <domain> scope`).
- A short structured block when findings exist:

  ```
  <source> <sha> — <msg>
    findings: N critical, N major
    discharged: N  asked: N  deferred: N
    queue: M (K in-progress)
  ```
- An author ask when escalating (see §4e).
- End-of-session: tail of the ledger + queue stats.

## 8. Integration

- **Built on**: `local/watch` (Monitor scaffolding), `local/coordinate`
  (PR triage helpers).
- **Dispatches**: see each child's Slot C.
- **Produces**: `beans/${NAME}-queue.json` (live state) +
  `beans/${NAME}-ledger.md` (event log).
- **Complements** other watchers — each owns one axis. Coordinate via
  `/coordinate` if the user is running more than one.

## 9. Role gating

- **reader**: may run in audit-only mode (queue + ask; no edits, no
  commits, no PR comments).
- **collaborator**: may auto-discharge Auto-discharge band findings, may
  commit on this branch, may post asks on PRs.
- **owner**: same as collaborator plus may commit to main when
  explicitly requested (still requires per-commit user approval).

## Anti-patterns (shared across all children)

- ❌ Re-implement scanner/analyser logic here. Always delegate to
  existing specialists / scripts.
- ❌ Subscribe to **every** open PR. Only last-7-day-active set + own PR
  + newly-opened (per TICK).
- ❌ Open > 1 ask per round on the same block. Batch findings.
- ❌ Edit `.ts` manifests to add a `status:` field (status is derived).
- ❌ Touch protected files (the deployment whitelist files, etc.).
- ❌ Hand-edit witness JSON to "fix" drift.
- ❌ Auto-merge a PR without explicit author approval.

Children add their own domain-specific anti-patterns.
