name: stalled-agent-triage
description: >
  Triage incoming work from stalled agents. Given named agents or sessions, or
  a time window, find what they left (handover reports, open PRs, branches,
  beans, issue and PR discussions, workflow instances), collect as many
  handover reports as exist, reconstruct the rest, consolidate the
  workstreams into 2–4 themes, recommend how to fold them into the current
  or a new work plan, and coordinate open PRs with their owners (the merge
  steward above all). Use when a session or a swarm has stalled, timed out
  or lost its container, or when the owner says "pick up what X was doing".

# Stalled-agent triage

A stall is not an event anyone records. The agent simply stops, and what it
was holding is spread across a dozen PRs, branches and beans, half of them
mid-merge. This skill turns that scatter into a short list of themes, a
recommendation, and a coordinated restart.

It **reads and recommends**. It does not finish anyone's work, close their PRs
or delete their branches. Picking up a theme is a separate, claimed piece of
work ([`bean-coordination`](bean-coordination.md)).

## Inputs

One of:

- **Named:** session URLs, agent ids, branch names, PR numbers or bean ids.
- **A time window:** for example "everything touched in the last 6 hours", or
  "since the 14:00 safety check".

## Procedure

### 1. Find the footprint

Gather in one batched pass, using REST (`gh api …`; GraphQL `gh pr list`
returns 403 in agent sessions):

| source | how | what it gives |
|---|---|---|
| handover reports | `beans/notes/*` whose title starts `handover:`, on `main` and on every open PR branch | the agent's own account; **read these first** |
| open PRs | `repos/…/pulls?state=open`, filtered by author session (`Claude-Session:` in bodies and commits) or by `updated_at` in the window | PR, branch, head, CI, mergeability |
| branches | `git ls-remote --heads origin` and commit dates | work with no PR yet |
| beans | `beans list` with `in-progress`, plus holder notes ([`bean-coordination`](bean-coordination.md)) | claims, blocks, `## Done when` |
| workflow instances | `beans/workflows/*.json` updated in the window | where in which process each one stopped |
| discussions | the last comments on each PR and issue | owner rulings and open questions |

### 2. Collect or reconstruct a report per agent

- **If a handover report exists, use it.** Check its claims against the live
  state: a "CI running" in a report is a guess by now. Note every place the
  report and reality disagree.
- **If none exists, reconstruct one** with the
  [`handover-report`](handover-report.md) template. Fill it from the
  footprint, and mark it *reconstructed* with the source for each fact.
  Leave "Unpushed or at-risk state" as **unknown**, never as empty: what a
  stalled agent had not pushed cannot be seen from here.
- **If the agent is still reachable, ask it** (`SendMessage` or
  `send_message`) for its report. That is cheaper and truer than
  reconstructing.

### 3. Consolidate into 2–4 themes

Group the workstreams by **what they deliver**, not by which agent held them.
For each theme:

- **Goal and epic:** the bean it serves; a theme with no epic is a finding.
- **Members:** PRs, branches and beans, each with its state, using the
  `merge:overlap` columns once that tool exists.
- **Dependencies:** what waits on what, and which member unblocks the most.
- **Risk:** a red head, a conflict, unpushed work, or a decision only the
  owner can make.

More than 4 themes means the grouping is too fine. One theme means the
stalls were one piece of work, which is fine; say so.

### 4. Recommend

For each theme, say one of:

- **Continue as is:** re-dispatch to one agent from its handover, under its
  existing bean.
- **Fold into the current work plan:** name the epic and the position.
- **New epic or bean:** with a title, a `## Done when`, and the members it
  takes over.
- **Park:** status `todo` with a block that has an expiry
  ([`bean-blocking`](bean-blocking.md)).
- **Scrap:** only with the owner's say. Never delete a bean, a branch or a PR
  ([`deletion-requires-confirmation`](../../conduct/conduct-core/deletion-requires-confirmation.md)).

Present this to the owner as **one decision in full**, with a count of the
rest ([`interaction-modality`](../../conduct/conduct-core/interaction-modality.md)
§4.1). Recommend first and state the default.

### 5. Coordinate

- **Open PRs go to the merge steward.** Tell it which PRs have lost their
  driver, which are green and ready, and which are mid-merge. A mid-merge
  branch is one with local conflict resolution that was never pushed; it is
  lost, and it is better re-done from the PR head than guessed at.
- **Notify the owning sessions** that are still alive before anyone touches
  their branches ([`coordinate`](coordinate.md)).
- **Record the triage** as a bean note on each theme's epic, titled
  `triage: <date>`, so the next triage starts from this one.

## Anti-patterns

- **Re-doing a stalled agent's work from memory** of what it was doing. Read
  the branch: the commit is the truth.
- **Treating "no report" as "nothing in flight".** It means the opposite.
- **Restarting every stalled agent at once.** That is a swarm, and it needs
  the owner's yes ([`swarm-management`](swarm-management.md)), plus disk and
  CPU headroom: four agents regenerating at once filled a 9 GB allowance on
  2026-10-02.
