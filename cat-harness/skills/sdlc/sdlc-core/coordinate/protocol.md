# coordinate — the Protocol, §1–§11

The eleven numbered coordination steps. Read this when you are **doing** the
coordination; the parent says when to invoke it and what it is for.

**Section numbers are the parent's and do not change here** — other skills cite
`coordinate §0a` and `coordinate.md §8a`, and those resolve to this file.

## Protocol

### 1.  Read sibling PRs first

For each sibling PR:

```bash
gh pr view <N> --json number,title,body,state,headRefName,updatedAt
gh pr view <N> --json files --jq '.files[].path'
```

Use `gh`'s embedded `--jq` (don't pipe to an external `jq`; it
isn't a guaranteed dependency in every Claude Code environment).
Read the **full** file list, not a truncated head — partial scope
maps cause silent overlaps later. File paths are cheap.

Or via MCP: `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` /
`mcp__github__pull_request_read` (with paginated `get_files`).

Build a **scope map**: which PR owns which workplan phase,
which files, which blocks, which scripts.

### 2.  Identify three relationships per sibling

For every sibling PR, classify yourself on three axes:

| Axis | Values |
|------|--------|
| **Overlap** | none / additive (different files, same goal) / conflicting (same file or same block) |
| **Dependency** | independent / I depend on theirs / they depend on mine |
| **Cherry-pick opportunity** | none / I want X / they probably want Y |

A sibling that is `(none, independent, none)` doesn't need a
coordination comment.  Anything else does.

#### 2-bis.  Domain-contract sync

**If your PR touches an algorithm, pipeline step, or data contract
that the project documents as a *maintenance contract* (a doc whose
`uses[]`, `computation.script`, `computation.witness`, and prose
sections must stay in sync with the actual code), you MUST update the
matching contract block in the same PR.**

Such a contract is not a static document: reviewers diff it against
the code change. When posting your intent comment on a sibling PR
whose scope overlaps such a contract, name the contract block(s) you
will touch alongside the script paths.

### 3.  Post intent before working

Use `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` (or `gh pr comment`) on each
sibling PR with non-trivial relationship.  Format:

```markdown
## Coordination from #<your PR>

**Picking up:** <one sentence — which workplan phase / task>

**Scope confirmation:**
- I will touch: `path/to/file:line-range`, `path/to/other`, …
- I will not touch: `<the sibling's territory>`

**Cherry-pick from you:**
- <what you need from them; e.g. "the template you used for `<block>`">

**Cherry-pick for you:**
- <what you'll produce that they may want; e.g. "the reader for
  `<artifact>` is the same shape they need for `<other path>`">

**Asks (small):** <questions they can answer in one line>

**Escalation to author:** <if any; see §6>
```

Keep it short.  One ask per ask.  No prose.

### 4.  Post progress at task boundaries

When you commit something cherry-pickable, post a follow-up:

```markdown
## Progress from #<your PR> · `<short-task-name>`

- Landed in `<commit-sha>`: <one sentence>
- Cherry-pick file pointers: `path/file.py:fn`, `path/file.lean:Decl`
- Updated [`<your-audit-or-plan-doc>.md`](…) §<section>: <what
  changed> — and/or appended a row to
  [`docs/coordination/<goal-slug>.md`](…)
- Next: <next task on your queue>
```

Cherry-pick file pointers are the load-bearing part — the sibling
agent should be able to copy/cite without reading your whole diff.

### 5.  Responding to review comments on your own PR

Code-review tools (`gemini-code-assist[bot]`,
`copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`, `codex[bot]`) and human
reviewers leave comments on your PR.  **Do not silently accept or
silently dismiss.**  The same rules that govern cross-PR
inconsistencies (§6) govern review feedback.

#### 5a.  Triage every comment

For each comment, assign one of four verdicts:

| Verdict | When | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| `accept` | Suggestion is correct and small | Apply the fix in a single commit citing the comment URL; mark the thread resolved if the tooling permits. |
| `accept-with-modification` | Intent is right but the suggested patch has its own issue (e.g. introduces a different off-by-one, or breaks a sibling-PR's convention) | Apply a corrected version; reply on the thread with one paragraph explaining what you did and why the original suggestion needed adjusting (cite `file:line` where the divergence matters). |
| `reject-with-reason` | Finding is incorrect (mathematically, empirically, or by project convention) | Reply with the reasoning: cite the specific line, definition, or sibling-PR convention that contradicts the suggestion.  Never silent-dismiss. |
| `escalate` | Finding is correct but would cross a sibling-PR's territory, or two reviewers disagree, or the comment exposes an inconsistency in a sibling PR's audit | See §6.  Reply with an `⚠️` flag and tag the author. |

#### 5b.  Verify against the actual artifact / code before replying

Review-tool suggestions can be **subtly wrong**.  Common failure
modes:

- **Off-by-one fixes that flip-flop a convention**: a reviewer
  proposes a boundary change without noticing context that makes
  the original correct.  Read the artifact, not just the suggested patch.
- **Cross-PR convention conflicts**: e.g. PR A names a field
  `active_set`, PR B names it `active_constraints`; a
  reviewer suggesting one without checking the other introduces
  a merge conflict downstream.  Check sibling PRs before applying.
- **Hallucinated context**: review tools sometimes reference PR
  numbers or comment IDs that don't exist.  If the reviewer
  references a comment you didn't write, treat it as a
  hallucination and ignore the cross-reference (but still
  evaluate the substantive content of the comment on its merits).

If you can't verify in &lt; 2 minutes, escalate (§6) rather than
guess.

#### 5c.  Post one consolidated status comment

After triaging all threads from one review pass, post a **single**
PR-level summary using `mcp__github__add_issue_comment`:

```markdown
Thanks @<reviewer> — addressed all <N> threads in [`<sha>`](<commit-url>).

| # | Issue | Verdict | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Off-by-one in index | accept | Fixed |
| 2 | … | accept-with-modification | Fixed differently — see note below |
| 3 | … | reject-with-reason | See reply on thread |
| 4 | … | escalate | ⚠️ tagged @<author> |

**Re #2 (note):** <short paragraph explaining the modification>
```

This avoids per-thread reply storms while still giving a paper
trail for every verdict.  Threads marked `accept` /
`accept-with-modification` should be resolved (`mcp__github__resolve_review_thread`)
once the reviewer acknowledges or after a one-day cooling period.

#### 5d.  When the reviewer pushes back

Code-review bots often respond to your reply.  Keep the dialogue
**short** — re-state the reasoning or the sibling-PR convention once,
ask for a yes/no on whether the reviewer agrees.  After the
second exchange, escalate (§6).  Loops with bots burn cycles
without converging.

### 6.  Inconsistent findings → escalate, do not paper over

If a sibling PR's finding contradicts yours — **or** if a code-review
comment claims a fact that contradicts a sibling PR's audit (§5a
`escalate`) — do NOT silently change your framing.  Post on every
affected PR:

```markdown
## ⚠️ Inconsistent finding — author input requested

- This PR's claim: <yours, file_path:line cited>
- Sibling #<N>'s claim: <theirs, file_path:line cited>  (or:
  Reviewer's claim in <comment-url>)
- Likely cause: <best guess, ≤ 2 sentences>
- Resolution requested: <which framing to adopt going forward>

Tagging @<author>.  Will hold downstream work blocked on this.
```

The author owns the resolution.  Do not "split the difference" or
guess.  Inconsistent findings — whether between sibling PRs, or
between a reviewer and a sibling PR — are an audit flag.

**Escalation rate-limit.**  An author who wakes up to fifteen
`@<author>` pings is a useless arbiter.  Batch-escalate when
possible: one comment listing every disagreement found in a
review pass, with a short table.

### 7.  Periodic sibling-PR triage

Sibling PRs land commits and comments while you work.  Without
periodic triage you will:

- duplicate a fix the sibling already landed,
- miss a question they posted directing back at you,
- accept a review-comment that contradicts a finding the sibling
  just published.

Run a triage **every 3–5 of your own commits**, or whenever you
finish one substantive task and pick up the next.  Format:

```
## Sibling-PR triage report (<your PR>, <timestamp>)

| PR | New comments | New commits | CI | Asks for me | Action |
|----|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|---|
| #564 | 6 | 8 | ✅ | (none) | none |
| #565 | 5 | 3 | 🟡 | P6 scope check (3 Q) | answer in next round |
| #568 | 1 | 1 | ⚪ | (cherry-pick acked) | post drop-duplicate notice |
```

For each "Asks for me" with verdict `answer` or `escalate`, queue a
coordination response in the next coordination round.  For verdict
`none` or `acked`, no further action.

**Use a background subagent for triage when possible** —
`Agent(subagent_type=Explore, run_in_background=true, prompt=...)` reads sibling
PRs without blocking your foreground work.  Triage prompt template:

> Background triage of sibling PRs <list>. For each:
> 1. New comments since <my last coordination round timestamp>.
> 2. New commits + sha + 1-line message.
> 3. CI status.
> 4. Specifically flag asks/replies directed at <my PR> + any
>    inconsistent findings vs <my key audit/artifact claims>.
> Report under 400 words; per-PR table.

### 8.  Watching `main` and newly-created branches

Sibling PRs are not the only thing that moves.  `main` lands merges,
and **new branches/PRs** sometimes open mid-session by the author or
other agents — these need to enter the scope map immediately.

#### 8a.  Watch `main` for new commits

Run `git fetch origin main` at each triage cycle.  If new commits
landed since your last fetch, run:

```bash
git log --oneline <last-fetched-main-sha>..origin/main \
  -- <files-or-paths-you-are-touching>
```

For each main-landed commit that touches **a file or block
you are editing**, classify it like a sibling PR using §2: overlap /
dependency / cherry-pick.  Then choose:

- **Merge `origin/main` into your branch** if the changes are
  additive and you don't have local edits to the same files.
- **Cherry-pick the relevant commit** if main's branch tip has too
  much unrelated noise.
- **Escalate to the author (§6)** if main's change contradicts a
  finding you just published.

Do not silently rebase or force-push to incorporate `main` — those
are author-authorised actions, see the repo's Git Operations policy.

##### 8a-bis.  Watch for new skills landing on main

In the same `git fetch origin main` pass, additionally run:

```bash
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A \
  <last-fetched-main-sha>..origin/main \
  -- '.claude/skills/local/*.md' '.claude/skills/*/*.md'
```

For each new skill file:

1. **Read its frontmatter** (`name`, `roles`, `description`,
   `inherits`).
2. **Decide relevance**: does the skill's description overlap your
   branch's scope?
   - Mention a file kind / domain / pattern you're editing (touched
     in `git diff origin/main..HEAD --name-only`), OR
   - Provide a new integration-watcher child (`inherits:
     local/integration-watcher`) and your branch is itself an
     integration-watcher PR, OR
   - Provide a new QA / sweep / audit skill (one-voice-*, proof-*,
     compute-*, etc.) and your branch touches the corresponding
     content blocks.
3. **Surface to the user via `AskUserQuestion`** with the standard
   3-chip pattern from `watch.md §3.Q3a`:
   - `Adopt now` — invoke the skill on the relevant subset
   - `Defer to follow-up branch` — record decision, don't change
     this branch
   - `Not relevant` — record so the watcher doesn't re-prompt
4. **Record the decision in the coordination ledger** under a
   new `## New skills detected on main` subsection so future
   sessions don't re-prompt.

This mirrors `watch.md §3.Q3a` and lets every coordinator
session pick up new infrastructure (audit watchers, scoring
heuristics, formalisation helpers) as it lands, without the user
having to manually announce skill additions to every in-flight PR.

#### 8c.  Pre-push stale-state check (MANDATORY)

**Trigger:** before every `git push` (whether new commits or force-
push). The watcher can lapse during long focused work — Monitor
timeouts, hooks-busy windows, or background-agent waits all silently
leave `origin/main` unfetched. Before any push, force a fresh fetch
and compute the upstream delta:

```bash
git fetch origin '+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main' 2>/dev/null
DELTA=$(git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main)
SIBS=$(git log --oneline ${MERGE_BASE:-$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)}..origin/main 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
echo "main is ${DELTA} commits ahead since branch base"
```

> **Fetch the ref you are about to read, with an explicit refspec.**
> `git fetch origin main` writes `FETCH_HEAD`; it refreshes
> `refs/remotes/origin/main` only when the clone's configured
> `remote.origin.fetch` covers that branch — and it **exits 0 either way**. A
> clone whose refspec has been narrowed to one branch (this happens: a `qou`
> clone was found pinned to a single sibling) answers every `origin/main`
> question from a ref that has not moved for days, and nothing in the output
> distinguishes that from being up to date. Use
> `+refs/heads/<b>:refs/remotes/origin/<b>`, which is correct whatever the
> clone is configured with.
>
> Two corollaries, both of which have bitten:
>
> - **Fetch the same ref you then read.** `watch.md §5b` fetched `main` and
>   measured `origin/<BRANCH>`, so its mandatory missed-commit recovery
>   reported 0 missed by construction.
> - **A per-branch refspec does not repair `for-each-ref`.** Anything walking
>   `refs/remotes/origin/claude/*` sees only what was fetched by name, so an
>   empty result means "never fetched", not "no siblings". Check
>   `git config --get-all remote.origin.fetch | grep 'refs/heads/\*'` before
>   believing it.

Decision matrix:

| Delta | Action |
|---|---|
| `0..2` | push freely |
| `3..10` | **fetch and triage**: list each new main commit; for any touching files in your branch's diff, classify per §2 (rebase-now, defer, escalate) BEFORE pushing |
| `> 10` | **stop**: announce to the user. Long-discharge sessions risk substantial divergence; offer prepare-merge rebase OR continue + flag |

Additionally, run `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` filtered to
`state:open updated since <session_start>` and check for sibling PRs
that opened mid-session. Each new sibling enters scope per §3.

This check is the difference between a clean fast-forward push and a
multi-conflict rebase storm. If you're discharging many small commits
in a row, invoke this between every ~5 commits OR after every 30 min
of foreground work.

#### 8d.  Long-task drift recovery

If you discover ≥ 5 new main commits AFTER a Monitor timeout or
hooks-busy window, do NOT just "re-arm and continue":

1. **Compare**: `git diff --name-only HEAD..origin/main` to find
   overlapping files.
2. **If overlap is empty**: re-arm watch (silent OK).
3. **If overlap exists**: invoke `coordinate` §2 classification
   on each overlap. Most common: another agent edited the same content
   block (`.lean`, `.md`, `.ts` trio). Resolve BEFORE committing
   more work that will conflict.
4. **Notify the user** if ≥ 2 substantive overlaps: this is the
   signal that multiple agents are working in the same scope and the
   user should coordinate goals.

#### 8b.  Watch for newly-opened PRs / branches

Each triage cycle, list open PRs and branches:

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,createdAt
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches --jq '.[].name'
```

If a **new** PR or branch appears since the last triage and its
title / branch-name overlaps any of your scope keywords (your
audit subjects, your changed files, your blocks), **prompt
the author**:

```markdown
**Q from #<your PR>:** I see #<N> (`<branch>`) opened at
<timestamp>; should I add it to my coordination scope (§3) and
post intent?  Or is it independent of the <goal> goal-thread?
```

Do not silently add the new PR to scope — the author may have
opened it as an isolated probe.  Wait for confirmation before
posting coordination comments on the new PR.

### 9.  Coordination ledger

Maintain a single shared ledger at:

```
docs/coordination/<goal-slug>.md
```

Each PR appends a row (no rewrites of others' rows):

```markdown
| Date | PR | Phase | Status | Cherry-pick |
|------|----|-------|--------|-------------|
| 2026-01-01 | #564 | phase A wire-up | landed `<sha>` | `<reader>` |
| 2026-01-01 | #565 | migration | in-progress | — |
| 2026-01-01 | #567 | sub-lemma | landed `<sha>` | `<block>` template |
```

The ledger lives on the branch where the coordinator is currently
posting; final state can be merged to main when the goal completes.

### 10.  Cherry-picking

**Cherry-picking is fine — treat it as a low-friction default.**
When an in-flight sibling has infrastructure (a script, a witness,
a template, a content block) that you'd otherwise
duplicate, just cherry-pick it. The cross-PR ceremony in earlier
revisions of this skill (mandatory "inform the sibling before",
"byte-for-byte identical or post the adaptation back") was
over-engineered for a working norm where small structured commits
exist precisely so they can be picked up by anyone.

The remaining rules are minimal:

1. **Cite the source in your commit message.** Either
   `Cherry-pick of #<N>:<sha>` on the trailer line or a
   `Co-authored-by:` line. Attribution is cheap and lets
   `git log --grep` surface who originated the change. Optional
   but recommended — missing attribution is not a blocker.

2. **One-voice still applies.** Whatever you keep from the source
   should read as your own work; rewrite voice / framing if the
   sibling's tone clashes (AGENTS.md voice rules don't relax just
   because the source was a different agent).

3. **You may diverge.** If you adapt the cherry-picked file —
   rename imports, change a helper, tighten a tolerance — that's
   normal. No requirement to post the adaptation back on the
   source PR; the sibling will see your divergence in their own
   §7 triage if it matters to them.

4. **You may pre-empt main.** Cherry-picks from open sibling PRs
   are explicitly allowed; you do not need to wait for the source
   to land on `main`. When the source eventually merges, you'll
   either pick up the canonical version on your next rebase
   (drift handled by the standard §1·a auto-resolve) or
   keep a slight divergence (also fine).

5. **Pre-flagging is optional.** If you're picking something
   substantive (a whole module, a large script) and want to
   reduce the chance of duplicated work, posting a one-liner
   coord comment on the source PR before picking is courteous —
   but it is **not required**. For small picks (single helper, a
   witness JSON, a class declaration), just commit.

When the source PR lands on `main`, attribution stops being
necessary — the file is just upstream code. A fresh PR sourced
from a main-merged commit needs no `Cherry-pick of` line.

### 11.  Asks and responses

Asks are a first-class artefact.  Format every cross-PR ask as:

```markdown
**Q from #<your PR>:** <question>

(answers as inline replies on the destination PR)
```

If a sibling has not answered an ask after 1 calendar day in an
async setting, restate the ask in a fresh comment and tag the
author.  Do not block indefinitely.
