# /saturation-meta-merge

Run the `saturation-meta-merge` skill. Read [`sdlc/skills/sdlc-core/saturation-meta-merge.md`](../../sdlc/skills/sdlc-core/saturation-meta-merge.md) and follow it.

This command is a pointer, generated from that skill's `user_invocable: true`; the
instructions live in the skill and nowhere else. The same skill is also served as the
MCP prompt `saturation-meta-merge` by the folio-assistant server.

Arguments, if any: $ARGUMENTS
