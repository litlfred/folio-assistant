/**
 * Diff the two ways `walkBlocks` can establish a block's identity, over a real
 * corpus.
 *
 * `walkBlocks` establishes each block's `kind` and `label` by importing it.
 * With `{ verify: false }` it reads them out of the source text instead, the
 * way it did before. The textual read is wrong in three demonstrated ways —
 * see `scripts/tests/block-walk-verify.test.ts` — but *how often* it is wrong
 * on a given corpus is a question about the content, not about the code, and
 * the corpora live in folio repositories rather than here.
 *
 * So this answers it in one command:
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run content/pipeline/verify-block-walk.ts ../qou/content/quantum-observable-universe
 * ```
 *
 * It prints every disagreement, every block only one mode finds, every block
 * that will not import, and what verification costs in wall-clock. This repo
 * has twice learned that lesson the hard way: `#125` let a non-block into the
 * walk, `qou/3fui` kept 63 real ones out, and in the second case the
 * measurement *reversed* the recommendation the change was argued on.
 *
 * The default was flipped on this tool's output against `qou` — 3557 blocks,
 * zero disagreements, zero load failures, 1475 ms against 450 ms. That is one
 * corpus. **Run this against any other folio before trusting the default
 * there**, and use `verify: false` if it disagrees.
 *
 * Exit code is 0 whatever it finds — this reports, it does not gate.
 *
