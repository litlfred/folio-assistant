/**
 * The Lean source LEXER — comment stripping and declaration splitting.
 *
 * @module content/pipeline/lean-lexer
 *
 * ## Why this is core and not the science layer
 *
 * Same test as `schemas/lean-packages.ts`, which holds the `lean.ref` grammar
 * for the same reason: would core function without the science layer
 * installed? It would not. `BlockBase` carries an optional `lean` field,
 * `QaCriterionDefinition` carries `lean_granularity: "statement"`, and
 * `qa-utils` consults the statement hash on EVERY freshness check — on a
 * document folio as much as a paper one, because the field is on shared block
 * kinds by design and the document profile forbids its USE rather than its
 * existence.
 *
 * So the grammar belongs wherever the field does. What is genuinely the
 * science layer's is what you DO with a parsed declaration — Atlas ingestion,
 * triviality probing, coverage tables — not how to find one in a file.
 *
 * ## Six copies of this existed
 *
 * `stripLeanComments` was reimplemented, independently, in
 * `qa-checkers-extended.ts`, `qa-checkers-vacuity.ts`,
 * `conditional-class-banner-audit.ts`, `qa-checkers-q-usage.ts` and
 * `scripts/lean-coverage.ts`, beside this canonical one. Six places to get
 * nested `/- … -/` wrong, and six that must independently remember the two
 * invariants stated below — that byte offsets are preserved, and that doc
 * comments are comments. A copy is unlikely to preserve either.
 *
 * This module is the one home they should converge on. Converging them is NOT
 * done here: each copy has to be read against this one first, because a
 * checker whose verdicts change means a corpus-wide re-sweep and some of the
 * differences may be deliberate. Tracked as its own bean.

/**
 * Strip Lean comments: `--` to end of line, and nestable `/- … -/`.
 *
 * Replaces comment bodies with equal-length whitespace so byte offsets
 * are preserved — the declaration splitter below indexes into the
 * result and must stay aligned with the original source.
 *
 * Doc comments (`/-- … -/`) are comments too: a decl name mentioned
 * only in prose is not a dependency. Skipping this step is how a
 * scanner invents edges out of documentation.

/**
 * What a declaration LOOKS like, lexically.
 *
 * EXPORTED so that the one other regex in this repository asking the same
 * question — `LEAN_DECL_RE` in `qa-checkers-q-usage.ts` — can be compared
 * against it by a test rather than by eye.
 *
 * ## They disagree, measured 2026-09-20 (bean `bqrg`)
 *
 * `stripLeanComments` was converged onto this module and is gated by
 * `lean-lexer-is-the-only-stripper.test.ts`. The DECLARATION SPLITTER was the
 * half left over, and it is not one duplicate but two functions answering
 * different questions off two different regexes:
 *
 * - `splitDeclarations` here returns byte offsets and a signature/body split;
 * - `leanDeclSpans` there returns 1-indexed inclusive LINE ranges, so a caller
 *   can blank everything outside a declaration while preserving line numbers.
 *
 * Those are genuinely different projections and neither replaces the other.
 * What IS duplicated is the pattern below, and the two copies have drifted in
 * four ways — three of which are defects HERE:
 *
 * | source | `axiom` | `opaque` | `unsafe` | dotted name |
 * |---|---|---|---|---|
 * | this | ✗ missed | ✗ missed | ✗ missed | ✓ `Foo.bar` |
 * | `LEAN_DECL_RE` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ truncates to `Foo` |
 *
 * **`axiom` is the sharp one.** `splitDeclarations` feeds `lean-signature.ts`
 * and `lean-triviality-probe.ts`, and in a formal corpus an axiom is the
 * declaration whose presence most changes what a proof is worth. A triviality
 * probe that cannot see one is blind to exactly what it exists to find.
 *
 * ## The sweep the pin was waiting for — run 2026-09-25
 *
 * The analysis above is right in every part, and this paragraph replaces only
 * its last inference. It read:
 *
 * > **This repository holds 0 `.lean` files**, so the sweep cannot be run here
 * > at all; it has to happen in a folio that carries a Lean corpus.
 *
 * The first clause is true and still asserted by a test. The conclusion does
 * not follow: the corpus is a SIBLING CHECKOUT, not a file in this tree, and
 * `lean-lexer-is-the-only-stripper.test.ts` in this same directory already
 * records a **3,954-file** sweep run from a container exactly like this one.
 * The repository contained its own counter-example.
 *
 * Re-run over **3,971 `.lean` files**, **52,144 declarations**:
 *
 *     union (below)          52,144
 *     DECL_RE, before        51,901   missed 243 in 105 files
 *                                     axiom 113, opaque 130; no `unsafe` in this corpus
 *     LEAN_DECL_RE           52,144   every name, 990 of them (1.9%) truncated at the dot
 *
 * **A missed keyword is not a skipped declaration.** `splitDeclarations`
 * slices from one start to the NEXT, so unrecognised text is absorbed into the
 * body of whatever precedes it. Those 243 were reported as part of another
 * declaration's body, in authored content:
 * `vertex-algebra-relations.lean` alone absorbed **9**. The triviality probe
 * splices bodies, so it would rewrite a neighbour's axiom.
 *
 * So the divergence is CONVERGED rather than pinned, and the pattern below is
 * the union: both keyword sets, both modifier sets, and the dotted name class.
 * `declarationStarts` is the single answer, with the two projections over it.
 *
 * `[^\S\n]*` rather than `\s*`, deliberately: `\s` matches a newline, so
 * `^\s*` under `/m` can begin a match on a blank line above the declaration
 * and put the offset on the wrong line. Harmless for the byte spans here, a
 * wrong answer for `leanDeclSpans`, which converts these offsets to line
 * numbers. Spans are unaffected — `bodyAt` is `from + cut`, both relative to
 * the same slice.

 *
 * - `lean-signature` hashes only the truncated signature, so
 *   `(let x := 5; x) = 5` and `... = 6` hash identically and a changed
 *   statement never invalidates its QA sidecar;
 * - `lean-triviality-probe` splices its tactic over the tail of the
 *   statement, the file stops elaborating, every ladder rung fails, and
 *   the declaration is recorded `closed: false` — "not machine-trivial";
 * - scan mode files the statement's own text under `value_deps`.
 *
 * Char literals are deliberately NOT tracked: `'` is far more often a
 * prime in an identifier (`h'`, `ih'`) than a delimiter, so treating it
 * as a quote would miscut far more declarations than it rescues.
