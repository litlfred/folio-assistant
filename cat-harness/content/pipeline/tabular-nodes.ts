/**
 * A tabular source becomes graph nodes — bean `p67i`, shape decided by `jg8s`.
 *
 * ## The rule, and it is the owner's
 *
 * > "both, sheet in grouping and single sheet. should model reality. not force
 * > conformance"
 *
 * | source | graph |
 * |---|---|
 * | multi-sheet workbook | `manifest.contains → sheet → table block(s)` |
 * | single-sheet CSV | `manifest.contains → table block` |
 *
 * **A sheet node appears iff the SOURCE has sheets.** Not iff there are two or
 * more: a one-sheet workbook still has a sheet, and a CSV has none however
 * many rows it holds. `schemas/tabular-csvw.ts` already decided this one level
 * down, setting `fac:anchor.sheet` to `null` for a CSV because *"a CSV
 * genuinely has no sheet, and writing `Sheet1` would invent one"*.
 *
 * Wrapping a CSV in a sheet node invents that sheet; flattening a workbook
 * discards a real one. Both uniform answers were a choice of which lie to tell
 * consistently.
 *
 * ## Two readers, deliberately — "special case of common scenarios ok"
 *
 * The owner's licence, same turn. There are two tabular records in this
 * repository and they are NOT merged behind a clever abstraction:
 *
 * - `folio-tabular-records/v1` (`tabular.jsonld`) — what `tabular-records.py`
 *   writes today, and the only one anything actually produces;
 * - `folio-tabular-csvw/v1` (`tabular.csvw.json` — JSON, not JSON-LD; bean `792y`) — CSVW, from `eief`, whose
 *   extractors are **stubbed on purpose**, so nothing writes it yet.
 *
 * {@link tabularShapeOf} reduces either to the little that a manifest needs.
 * Reading only CSVW would make this emitter unable to fire — the vacuity this
 * repository has spent a day removing — and reading only the old one would
 * strand it when the extractors land. Two named branches, each legible; when
 * `folio-tabular-records/v1` retires, one of them goes.
 *
