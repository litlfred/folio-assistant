/**
 * Registry of QA criteria the per-block sweep recognises.
 *
 * Each criterion is one independently-trackable audit dimension.
 * The sweep walker iterates the registry and, per block, decides
 * whether to run the automated checker or queue an agent / human
 * adjudication request.
 *
 * ## Domains — and this list is not the list
 *
 * A domain is a bucket of criteria, and **the registry below is what exists**.
 * Naming the domains here as well is a second index, free to disagree with the
 * first, and it did: this header described four domains for a registry that
 * carries many more, so a reader who trusted it got a list that was wrong by
 * omission the day it was written. Count `QA_CRITERIA_REGISTRY`, or read the
 * `── Domain: … ──` headings, rather than this paragraph.
 *
 * What is worth saying here is the thing the entries cannot say about
 * themselves:
 *
 * - `voice` — the editorial register. Its per-VOICE overlay criteria are
 *   DERIVED from the voices an instance ships, not written here: see
 *   `voice-criteria.ts`, and `qaCriteriaFor(root)` rather than
 *   `QA_CRITERIA_REGISTRY` if you want them.
 * - `framework` and `wall` — **one folio's mathematics**, not platform
 *   concerns. Both are fenced behind the `archimedean-wall` opt-in axis —
 *   see the note above each — so a folio that has not asked for that
 *   mathematics is not measured against it.
 *
 * This header cited `.claude/skills/local/one-voice-audit.md` as what the
 * `voice` domain extends. **That file does not exist in this repository** —
 * it is a folio's local skill, named from the platform, in the most-read
 * comment in the QA subsystem. Bean `btuv`: the registry's folio-specific
 * content is not only the criteria, it is the prose around them.
 *
 * ── Chapter-scoped criteria (NOT per-block) ──────────────────────
 *
 * Some audit dimensions live on the chapter manifest, not on a block,
 * so they are NOT entries in `QA_CRITERIA_REGISTRY` (the per-block
 * sweep + agent-drain-queue would mis-scope and balloon them). They
 * are run by dedicated standalone scripts instead:
 *
 * - `voice-section-title-coherence` — section/subsection/chapter
 *   titles must be short, concise, and coherent read against their
 *   responsible parent (paper owns chapter titles, chapter owns
 *   section titles, section owns subsection titles). Mechanical
 *   defects (auto-split ` : <tag>` artifacts, trailing colons,
 *   over-long / compound titles) are flagged automatically; the
 *   story-coherence judgement is an agent pass over the emitted
 *   worklist. Script: `content/pipeline/qa-section-title-audit.ts`.
 *
 * @module content/pipeline/qa-criteria-registry

// ── Folio-optional: the archimedean wall ────────────────────────
//
// `detangler-archimedean-wall` is a `detangler`-domain criterion by
// mechanism and a SINGLE FOLIO's mathematics by content. Its wall, its
// classifier and its six chapter directory names (`archimedean-universe/`,
// `observations/`, `fluid-dynamics/`, `braids-and-knots/`,
// `quantum-observable-universes/`, `quantum-universes/`) are qou's, and
// `profiles: ["paper"]` does not fence them: any paper folio has a `.lean`
// to read, so every other paper folio was being audited against chapters it
// does not have. Measured here — this platform repo's own sidecars under
// `test/results/block-qa/content/docs/publication-workflow/` carry
// `detangler-archimedean-wall` verdicts on workflow documentation.
//
// So it is registered only when the folio opts in:
//
//   // harness.config.json
//   { "qaAxes": ["archimedean-wall"] }
//
// The generic shell underneath — *a node must live on the side of a
// declared partition wall that its content places it on* — is worth keeping
// and is NOT what is fenced; re-expressing the wall, the classifier and the
// chapter list as folio-supplied data (the repair `detangler-topic-coherence`
// already had, when `DETANGLER_CHAPTER_KEYWORDS` migrated out to a
// folio-supplied `topic-keywords.json`) would let the shell return to the
// unconditional `detangler` axis. Until then, fenced.
//
// SAME AXIS as the `wall` domain above, and deliberately so: it is one wall,
// so a folio opens both with one key and cannot end up half-fenced. A second
// axis name would have made that state reachable.
//
// The `wall` domain was recorded here as "not fenced — its checkers are
// called directly from `q-usage-audit.ts` and pinned by two tests, so it is
// its own change with its own measurement." It got that measurement and both
// halves of the caution were non-blocking: discovery is registry-driven, so a
// fenced axis's checkers are simply not surfaced (verified against `q-usage`,
// already fenced, BEFORE changing anything), and the direct callers in
// `q-usage-audit.ts` are untouched by design — a folio's own audit deciding
// the wall applies is a different question from what the platform asserts
// every folio must be measured against.

// (negation-contrast, rhetorical-pivot, closing-aphorism,
// meta-commentary, thesis-restatement) are rare in human scholarly
// drafting and near-universal in unedited model output — severity
// `major`; the density four plus the corroborating one are `minor`.
