/**
 * Dependency injection point for a folio's chapter profiles.
 *
 * Which q-regimes a chapter may use, which chapters are categorical, and which
 * are archimedean, are **editorial judgements about one folio's chapters** —
 * qou's, specifically. They were hardcoded in `qa-checkers-q-usage.ts`: a
 * 31-entry `CHAPTER_EXPECTED_REGIMES` map keyed by qou chapter directory names
 * (`"braids-and-knots"`, `"models-of-qous"`, `"appendix-surreals"`), plus two
 * chapter sets. AGENTS.md rules that out flatly — "if you are about to write
 * subject matter here (a chapter, a constant, a vocabulary), you are either in
 * the wrong repo or writing something that belongs in the folio as data."
 *
 * Third registry in this family, and deliberately the same shape as
 * `value-registry-di.ts` and `references-registry-di.ts`: an interface the
 * platform declares, a `configure*` the folio calls before invoking pipeline
 * functions, and Proxy-backed value exports so the existing consumers keep
 * reading `CHAPTER_EXPECTED_REGIMES[chapter]` unchanged.
 *
 * ## Unconfigured means "no opinion", not "no chapters"
 *
 * `value-registry-di` and `references-registry-di` THROW when unconfigured,
 * because a values or bibliography lookup that returns nothing is a bug. This
 * one does not, and the difference is deliberate: a chapter profile is an
 * optional editorial policy, and a folio that declares none is a legitimate
 * folio, not a broken one. So the default is an empty registry, and every
 * accessor is written so that "unconfigured" reads as **`n/a` — no expectation
 * recorded**, never as "expectation met".
 *
 * That distinction is the whole point. `qa-checkers-q-usage` already treats a
 * chapter absent from the map as unscored, so an empty registry makes the
 * chapter-profile criteria uniformly `n/a` rather than silently passing —
 * `chapterHasProfile()` is what a caller checks to tell the two apart.
 *
