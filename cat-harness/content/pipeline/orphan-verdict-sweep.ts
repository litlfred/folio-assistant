/**
 * Verdicts in the results tree whose block is gone — the corpus-wide half.
 *
 * ## Why `no-orphan-sidecar` cannot be this
 *
 * That check runs per directory load and, since bean `2634`, reaches exactly
 * one results directory: the mirror of the block directory being loaded. That
 * is enough for the case it exists for — a block MOVING between chapters and
 * leaving a verdict at the old path — because both chapters still exist and
 * both get loaded.
 *
 * It is structurally blind to one case. **Delete a block directory outright
 * and its mirror survives with nothing to visit it, ever**, because the only
 * thing that reaches a mirror is a load of the directory it mirrors. Under the
 * old adjacency this could not arise: the verdicts were INSIDE the directory
 * and went with it. Bean `pb2b`.
 *
 * Widening `no-orphan-sidecar` to walk the whole tree was rejected and the
 * reasoning is worth keeping: it would report the entire repo's orphans when
 * you asked to validate one chapter, and it would report each of them once per
 * chapter loaded. A corpus question needs a corpus entry point.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of finding, because the remedies differ
 *
 * `moved` — the block directory still exists and the manifest does not. A
 * block moved or was deleted; `validate` sees this too, and either place is a
 * fine one to notice it.
 *
 * `abandoned` — **the block directory itself is gone.** Nothing else in this
 * repository will ever report it. This is the finding that justifies the
 * sweep, and it is reported separately so a reader can tell the sweep earned
 * its run.
 *
 * ## An absent tree is "could not determine", never "no orphans"
 *
 * This sweep used to treat a missing `test/results/block-qa/` as a determined
 * empty and print `✓ no orphaned block verdicts`. Bean `c8uq` (reader audit
 * `qa-readers-audit-2026-10-01.md`, defect **C6**): once derived QA leaves
 * `main` for the `qa-reports` branch, EVERY checkout lacks the tree until
 * `bun run qa:fetch` materialises it, so that `✓` would be printed on every run
 * over zero verdicts — measured, it was. {@link sweepOrphanVerdicts} therefore
 * reports how many verdicts it EXAMINED, and the CLI refuses through
 * `vacuityRefusal` (exit 2, "could not determine") when that is zero. A folio
 * that genuinely has never swept gets the same refusal, which is the honest
 * answer: nothing was judged, so nothing can be called clean.
