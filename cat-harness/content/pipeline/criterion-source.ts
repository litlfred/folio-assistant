/**
 * Where one criterion's checker lives — ONE answer, composed, never two.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a `??`
 *
 * `qa-checker-discovery.ts`'s own header records what went wrong the last time
 * two things answered this question: `qa-sweep` dispatched
 * `AUTOMATED_CHECKERS[id] ?? DAK_AUTOMATED_CHECKERS[id]`, and *"the dispatch
 * table was a second answer to a question the registry already answered, and
 * the two were free to disagree."*
 *
 * A contributed checker could easily be the same mistake wearing a registry's
 * clothes. It is not, because the two sources **partition**: core's
 * `QA_CRITERIA_REGISTRY` declares criteria whose checkers core owns, and a
 * dependency contributes checkers for criteria it owns. A criterion claimed by
 * both is not a fallback chain, it is a collision — so this **throws**, naming
 * both claimants, exactly as `ContributionRegistry.register` does for two
 * dependencies claiming one criterion. That is the difference between
 * composing two partitions and preferring one table over another.
 *
 * ## The trap on the other side
 *
 * `getCriterionSourceFile` ends in a **default** — an id it does not recognise
 * resolves to `qa-checkers-extended.ts`. That default is not harmless:
 * `script_hash` is computed over the resolved path, so a criterion pointed at
 * a file that does not contain its checker NEVER INVALIDATES; eleven criteria
 * were measured in that state on 2026-09-18.
 *
 * So a criterion whose checker moved OUT of core must not simply be dropped
 * from the cascade — it would land on that default. `QaCriterionDefinition`
 * carries {@link QaCriterionDefinition.checker_contributed} instead, and this
 * resolver refuses to answer from the cascade for such a criterion. An
 * unresolved one is reported as unresolved, which is a third state and not a
 * path.
