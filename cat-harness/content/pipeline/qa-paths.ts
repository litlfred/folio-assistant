/**
 * Where a BLOCK's QA verdict lives — one answer, for every writer and reader.
 *
 * ## The convention this replaces, and what it cost to replace
 *
 * A block is a family of companion files sharing one path prefix: `block.root`
 * is the `.ts` manifest minus its extension, and `${root}.md`, `${root}.lean`
 * and `${root}.qa.json` are its siblings. The verdict was simply one member of
 * that family, which is why nine sites across this pipeline each composed its
 * path by hand rather than calling anything — it was not a lookup, it was a
 * convention every reader already knew.
 *
 * Moving it is the owner's decision (2026-09-19): an artefact generated
 * primarily as a QA reviewer belongs under `test/results/` as part of a QA
 * process, and placement follows provenance. This module is what makes that
 * survivable — nine hand-composed paths become one function, so the family is
 * broken in exactly one place instead of nine.
 *
 * ## The tree MIRRORS the block's directory
 *
 * `content/docs/evidence/overview.qa.json` becomes
 * `test/results/block-qa/content/docs/evidence/overview.qa.json`.
 *
 * Flat would collide: block stems repeat freely across chapters, far more than
 * the four collisions measured in the KG corpus. Mirroring also keeps the
 * chapter legible in the path, which is what a reader opening a verdict needs.
 *
 * ## Reading falls back; writing never does
 *
 * {@link blockQaReadPaths} returns the results-tree location FIRST and the
 * legacy sibling SECOND. That asymmetry is the whole compatibility story:
 *
 * - A downstream folio has its verdicts committed beside its blocks. If this
 *   platform only looked in the results tree, every one of those folios would
 *   report every block as unaudited the day it upgraded — a false pass at
 *   corpus scale, which is the failure direction this repository guards
 *   against everywhere else.
 * - Writing to the legacy location as well would create two verdicts for one
 *   block that can disagree, and nothing would say which is current.
 *
 * So: read both, prefer the new, write only the new. A folio migrates by
 * running its sweep once.

 * and locales), reading falls back to the legacy sibling so a downstream folio
 * does not report every translation unaudited the day it upgrades, and writing
 * never falls back so one subject cannot end up with two verdicts that
 * disagree.
 *
 * **One reason here is not in the block case, and it is the stronger one.** A
 * translation subject may be a page under the Jekyll site — `docs/index.md` is
 * the one that prompted this (bean `pp93`) — and a sibling verdict there is not
 * merely untidy, it is PUBLISHED. `docs/index.fr.translation-qa.json` would be
 * copied into `_site` and served, an internal QA artefact on the public docs
 * site with no page linking to it. The results tree is outside the site, so the
