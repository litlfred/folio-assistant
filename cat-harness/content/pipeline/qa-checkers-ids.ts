/**
 * QA checkers for the `ids` axis — a block's label is its identity in the
 * `folio/` graph, and these criteria keep that identity trustworthy.
 *
 * Everything that compares or annotates a folio keys on the label: the
 * content graph (`content-graph.ts` sets `nodes` by label), a block-level
 * diff between `main` and a staging branch, a review comment anchored to a
 * block, and a heat map aggregating by block. If a label is shared, or
 * changes silently, each of those goes wrong without failing:
 *
 * - **Shared.** `buildContentGraph` overwrites the earlier node, and
 *   `validate.ts` adds labels to a `Set`, so the second block silently takes
 *   the first one's place. `validate.ts` does catch a block NAME listed twice
 *   in a chapter manifest; it does not catch two different blocks declaring
 *   one LABEL. Measured 2026-09-22.
 * - **Changed.** A diff reads a renamed block as one removed and one added,
 *   and every review comment on the old label is orphaned.
 *
 * Two criteria, both mechanical:
 *
 * - `id-unique` — no two blocks in the folio declare one label, and no block
 *   takes a label another block records as a former id (`renamedFrom`).
 *   Reusing a retired id re-attaches the old block's review history to an
 *   unrelated block, which is worse than losing it.
 * - `id-stable` — a block whose `.ts` existed at the base ref (default
 *   `origin/main`) keeps that label, or records the old one in
 *   `renamedFrom`.
 *
 * A third, `id-reingest-stable`, is deliberately NOT here: it needs an ingest
 * that emits blocks, and none does yet (bean `xtpc`). A criterion with nothing
 * to check would sweep as `n/a` everywhere, which reads as coverage.
