/**
 * Append an agent (or human) reviewer entry to a block's QA sidecar.
 *
 * The adjudication counterpart of the script scanners: a sub-agent that
 * has read a block in full records its verdict per criterion without
 * hand-editing JSON. Entries are APPENDED to the criterion's array
 * (script candidates are preserved; the freshest entry whose field_hash
 * matches the current sources wins, per the block-qa/v1 convention).
 *
 *   bun run cat-harness/content/pipeline/qa-agent-entry.ts \
 *     --block   <path to block .md>            (required)
 *     --criterion <criterion-id>               (required)
 *     --result  pass|fail|warn|n/a             (required)
 *     [--severity critical|major|minor]
 *     [--evidence "<what was found / why the verdict>"]
 *     [--notes    "<fix applied / fix proposed / scope note>"]
 *     [--id       <reviewer id>]               (default: agent:session)
 *
 * The field_hash is computed from the block's CURRENT .md/.ts/.lean content,
 * so run this AFTER any prose fix, and the entry certifies the fixed
 * state.
