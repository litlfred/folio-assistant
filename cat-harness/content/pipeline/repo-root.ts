/**
 * Content-repo root resolution for pipeline code.
 *
 * The pipeline lives in **folio-assistant** but operates on a downstream
 * *content* repo (e.g. `qou`), which embeds folio-assistant as a symlinked
 * subdirectory.  Computing the root as `resolve(import.meta.dir, "..", "..")`
 * therefore lands inside folio-assistant's own tree — *not* the content repo
 * — so witness files under `<content-repo>/computations/…` and
 * `<content-repo>/content/<paper>/…` can never be resolved.
 *
 * Instead, walk up from the current working directory (which, for every
 * pipeline invocation, is the content repo) until we find the directory that
 * contains both `computations/` and `content/`.  Fall back to the old
 * import-relative guess if the walk fails (e.g. unusual harnesses), so behaviour
 * never regresses below the previous baseline.
 *

// The `folio` graph kind is registered by CORE. This module is a LIBRARY, so it
// does NOT import that registration: a library's edge is inherited by every
// module that imports it, and the harness may not depend on core. The
// COMMAND that runs carries it — and since #840 every caller does, because
// the trigger sits at the foot of `cat-harness.ts` and a reader lives in that
// module, so loading it is a precondition of calling one.
//
// THIS COMMENT NAMED `check:composition-roots` AS THE GUARANTEE UNTIL
// 2026-09-22, in SEVEN files, AND THAT SCRIPT DOES NOT EXIST. `bun run
// check:composition-roots` exits "Script not found". The safety argument for
// a library omitting the registration rested on a gate nobody built, and no
// gate failed to say so — the same silence this repository keeps paying for.
// It is moot now rather than fixed: #840 made the registration automatic, so
// there is no longer a command that can forget it (bean `z9ax`).

 * `content/`. Requiring both made this resolver silently return the
 * folio-assistant tree for such repos, which is how "platform, not
 * content" leaks: every pipeline script then reads the wrong root.
 *
 * 1. Prefer an ancestor with BOTH `computations/` and `content/` — the
 *    strongest signal, and it keeps behaviour identical for folios that
 *    have both.
 * 2. Otherwise accept the nearest ancestor with `content/`.
