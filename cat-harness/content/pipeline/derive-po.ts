/**
 * Recover a `.po` catalogue from a page that is ALREADY TRANSLATED.
 *
 * Issue #206, and the blocker it left on `main`: five pages were published in
 * five locales with no catalogue, `translation-drift` fails on every one, and
 * the owner ruled against recording the absences — *"ask the `t8g3` campaign for
 * the actual `.po` catalogues rather than record their absence"* (bean `ngxj`).
 * The catalogues are the fix. This derives the ones that can be derived
 * SOUNDLY, and refuses the rest loudly.
 *
 * ## The registry says this cannot be done, and it is nearly right
 *
 * `translation-drift.ts` records, as the reason two pages sit in `UNCATALOGED`:
 *
 * > A catalogue cannot be derived from a finished translation without inventing
 * > the segmentation
 *
 * That is true of a translation you can only read as prose. It is NOT true when
 * the SAME deterministic extractor runs on both sides: `extractMarkdown` walks
 * headings, paragraphs, list items, blockquotes and table cells in document
 * order, so a translation that preserves its source's structure yields the same
 * sequence of constructs. Pairing by position is then reading one segmentation,
 * not inventing a second.
 *
 * **The whole question is whether the structure IS preserved, and that is what
 * this module refuses on.**
 *
 * ## Why the check is the KIND SEQUENCE and not the count
 *
 * A count match is not an alignment, and on this corpus that was not academic.
 * Before the extractor fixes below, `fr/accessibility` and `ru/getting-started`
 * matched their source's entry count EXACTLY and each diverged in kind partway
 * through — at construct 32 and 53, a source `paragraph` against a translated
 * `table-cell`. A count-only check would have written two catalogues pairing a
 * paragraph's msgid with a table cell's text, and nothing downstream would have
 * noticed: a `.po` is well-formed whatever it claims.
 *
 * ## What the refusals turned out to be ABOUT, measured twice
 *
 * A refusal says the two documents are not the same shape. It does **not** say
 * the translator restructured the page, and reading it that way was wrong for
 * some of them. Two properties of `pot-extract.ts` were not locale-neutral:
 *
 * - **`MD_MIN_TEXT_LEN` was a minimum in CHARACTERS** (bean `6b8u`). Stripping
 *   code spans left `", "` (2) in English and `"، و"` (3) in Arabic, so an
 *   identical 4x7 table yielded 66 constructs in `ar` against 65. It ran the
 *   other way for dense scripts, where `否` is one character and was dropped
 *   while `non` and `нет` were kept. Now a count of LETTERS.
 * - **A code fence was recognised only at column 0** (bean `ig4a`), so an
 *   indented fence inside a list item was not a fence and its body was
 *   extracted as prose.
 *
 * | | pairs aligned | measured on |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | before either fix | **7** / 25 | `main` @ `a0fbdc7ac7`, 2026-09-26 |
 * | after both | **10** / 25 | this branch, same day |
 *
 * **The first account of this said 9 more, and that was wrong.** It inferred the
 * number by stitching together a count measurement and a kind measurement taken
 * separately. Measured directly on the thing that matters — count and kind
 * together — the two fixes unlock **three**.
 *
 * **These numbers are measurements, not invariants, and each carries the tree it
 * was taken on for that reason.** They move when anyone edits a source page: hours
 * after the 10 above, `main` added two constructs to `docs/installation.md`,
 * `ar/installation` stopped aligning, and the pair became **9 / 16**. A test of
 * mine asserted the equality and CI failed it — correctly. The equality is gone;
 * what is asserted now is that alignment is partial and that no pair diverges by
 * KIND, which is the part that is about this module rather than about the corpus.
 *
 * The remainder all refuse as `count-differs`; no pair diverges by kind any
 * more. A **third** extractor property accounts for most of them and is
 * deliberately NOT fixed here (bean `lvk9`): **list items and blockquotes are
 * extracted one entry per LINE**, so how many entries a construct yields depends
 * on where the author pressed return — and a wrapped list item's continuation
 * falls through to the paragraph accumulator, so it is emitted as a `paragraph`.
 * Wrong count and wrong kind from one cause. No translator preserves an English
 * hard wrap.
 *
 * | | aligned |
 * |---|---|
 * | today | 10 / 25 |
 * | + blockquotes coalesced | 13 / 25 |
 * | + wrapped list items coalesced | **17 / 25** |
 *
 * It also settles what the remaining refusals are NOT. `es`, `ru` and `zh`
 * `accessibility` diverge at the same three source indices and all land on
 * exactly 117 — three locales agreeing to the entry is one cause, and it is this
 * one. All three align once wrap is out of the way, so those pages were never
 * short. Bean `7x8o` is corrected accordingly.
 *
 * Its own bean, for two reasons: it changes what a list-item or blockquote msgid
 * IS, rewriting existing catalogues' entries rather than adding and removing
 * them; and the rule used to MEASURE the 17/25 above over-merges (it joined two
 * unrelated sentences in `wireframes/fsh-guts/intent.md`), so a correct fix needs
 * indentation-aware continuation handling and 17/25 is a crude rule's reach
 * rather than a promise.
 *
 * **The kind check is vindicated either way.** Whatever the cause, those two
 * pairs WERE misaligned, and a count-only check would have shipped them.
 *
 * ## What a matching kind sequence does NOT prove
 *
 * It is necessary, not sufficient. Two adjacent paragraphs could have swapped
 * and the sequence would still match. This is stated rather than hidden because
 * a caller deciding whether to trust the output needs it: what the tool
 * establishes is that the two documents have the same SHAPE, and it infers
 * correspondence from that plus the fact that these translations were produced
 * from these sources. A human sign-off is what turns that into an official
 * translation — #206's own distinction, and the reason every catalogue written
 * here is marked unofficial in its header.

/**
 * Align a translation against a source that has GROWN, or report that it cannot.

 * corpus's six remaining refusals were `installation`, each short by exactly the
 * two Windows/Git Bash paragraphs `main` added on 2026-09-26.
 *
 * **That is not a translation defect, and refusing it outright was leaving work
 * undone.** A catalogue whose source has grown is an ordinary, expressible thing:
 * the constructs that were translated carry their translation, and the ones added
 * since carry an empty `msgstr`, which is precisely what gettext's untranslated
 * state means. Issue #206's *"official goes stale when its source changes"* is
 * this case, and an empty `msgstr` is how a catalogue says so.
 *
 * Returns one entry per SOURCE construct: the matching translation, or `undefined`
 * where the source has no counterpart.
 *
 * **Refuses unless every translated construct is matched.** A subsequence
 * alignment is only sound in one direction — the translation must be a
 * subsequence of the source, meaning things were ADDED to the source and nothing
 * was dropped from the translation. If the translation has a construct the source
 * does not, the two have diverged rather than drifted, and pairing what is left
 * would be inventing an alignment rather than reading one.
 *

 * walk over kinds finds a complete match whenever one exists for a true
