/**
 * Check a folio's blocks against the content profile it declares.
 *
 * ## What this catches that schema validation cannot
 *
 * `content_validate` checks each block against its own Zod schema and the
 * constraint table. Both are profile-blind by construction: a `theorem` is a
 * valid `theorem` whatever kind of folio it sits in, and `constraints.ts`
 * has no way to know that this repo's `harness.config.json` says `document`.
 *
 * So a document folio can accumulate math blocks — most easily by an agent
 * reaching for `theorem` out of habit, or by a paper folio being re-declared
 * as a document — and nothing says a word until publication, when the render
 * needs a `.lean` file and a TeX installation the folio was set up without.
 * This is the check that turns that into an error at authoring time.
 *
 * Two rules, both from `schemas/block-kinds.ts`:
 *
 * 1. every block's kind is in the declared profile
 *    ({@link kindsOutsideProfile}); and
 * 2. in the `document` profile, no block carries a `lean` field at all
 *    ({@link DOCUMENT_FORBIDS_LEAN}) — several document kinds *declare* one
 *    as optional, so rule 1 alone would let a `remark` smuggle in a
 *    formalization the folio has no toolchain to check.
 *
 * @module content/pipeline/profile-check
