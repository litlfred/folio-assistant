/**
 * Extract and inject the translatable text of a BPMN diagram.
 *
 * `schemas/translation-tools.ts` has declared a `bpmn` format for the DAK
 * content type since the translation work landed — "BPMN label translation.
 * Diagram is re-rendered after text injection to handle text overflow in
 * translated labels" — with **no `extractModule` and no `injectModule`**, and
 * no code behind it anywhere. The declaration was the whole implementation.
 * This is the extract/inject half; `scripts/render-bpmn.ts` is the re-render.
 *
 * ## What is translatable, and what is emphatically not
 *
 * Translatable: the `name` attribute of a process, lane, activity, gateway,
 * event or sequence flow, and the text of a `<documentation>` element. These
 * are the strings a reader sees in the rendered diagram.
 *
 * NOT translatable, and the reason each would break something:
 *
 *   - `id` and every reference to one (`sourceRef`, `targetRef`,
 *     `calledElement`, `bpmnElement`, `flowNodeRef`). Translating an id
 *     silently disconnects the graph — `workflow_next` would report a flow
 *     pointing at a node that no longer exists.
 *   - `<bootstrap.processes:skill ref>`, `<cat-harness.processes:bean op>`, `<cat-harness.processes:policy>`. A translated
 *     skill ref resolves to nothing, which is the exact defect
 *     `check:workflow-refs` exists to catch — a translation pass must not
 *     manufacture the thing another gate is there to prevent.
 *   - Anything under `<bpmndi:BPMNDiagram>`: coordinates and shape bounds.
 *
 * ## On the authored line breaks
 *
 * Labels here carry hand-placed `&#10;` breaks, tuned so the text sits well
 * in a 140x80 task box. A translator receiving the msgid has no reason to
 * reproduce them, so the msgid is offered with the breaks turned into
 * spaces — and MEASURED, 2026-09-18, that costs nothing: rendering a French
 * set ~18% longer with every authored break dropped produced the same 3
 * lines occupying 42px of the 80px box, because bpmn-js re-wraps regardless.
 * The breaks are not load-bearing. If a future diagram does overflow, the
 * fix is the shape bounds, not the string.
