/**
 * readme-links.ts — verify the links a README already carries.
 *
 * ## Why an audit and not a sixth generated section
 *
 * `readme-sections.ts` made the *generated* parts of a folio README verify
 * their own targets. Everything else in the file is authored Markdown, and
 * nothing checked it at all — which is how qou's Published Artefacts table
 * came to list `blueprint/` and `docs/`, neither of which has ever existed on
 * `gh-pages` (the Lean documentation is published at `lean/docs/`). Both rows
 * were dead in both columns, in a table nobody could regenerate.
 *
 * Generating that table instead would mean inventing its labels — "Folio
 * landing page", "Blueprint (interactive graph)", the Project Structure
 * descriptions — which are prose worth keeping. The defect was never the
 * layout going stale; it was targets that do not resolve. So this verifies
 * what the author wrote and never rewrites a byte of it.
 *
 * ## What is left here, and what moved (bean `cp3l`)
 *
 * The **auditor** — parse, classify, resolve against the working tree or a
 * ref, report a third state for what it could not check — is
 * `src/core/markdown-links.ts`, because none of it was ever about a README.
 * It lived here because the first caller did, and the cost was one layer out:
 * a harness-level check over `AGENTS.md` had to reach into core to audit a
 * link, so every future harness link check inherited a wrong-direction edge.
 *
 * What stays is the README-shaped front end and nothing else: which file to
 * audit when nobody names one (**asked** of the declaration, not composed),
 * the config that supplies the publish targets, and the CLI.
 *
 * @module content/pipeline/readme-links
 * @covers docs
