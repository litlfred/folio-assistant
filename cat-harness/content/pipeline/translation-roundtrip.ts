/**
 * Record an AGENTIC semantic round trip as witnesses on a block's translation
 * sidecar.
 *
 * `translation-block-qa.ts` measures what a script can measure — coverage,
 * preserved terms, untranslated echoes — and declares
 * `translation-semantic-roundtrip` with no entry, because the only offline
 * back-translation is the PO read backwards, which returns the source exactly
 * and would score a perfect similarity on the lookup table rather than on the
 * translation. This module is how that criterion gets a real verdict.
 *
 * ## Two agents, and the separation between them IS the measurement
 *
 * | agent | sees | produces |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | back-translator | the TARGET-language text only | an independent rendering back into the source language |
 * | adjudicator | the ORIGINAL and the back-translation | pass / warn / fail, with the drifts named |
 *
 * Neither sees what would let it shortcut. A back-translator shown the English
 * original writes the original back and the check passes vacuously; an
 * adjudicator shown the French can talk itself into any reading of the
 * back-translation. Ask the back-translator to confirm it used no tools: an
 * agent with filesystem access can find the source in the repository, and then
 * the number measures its search rather than the translation.
 *
 * One agent doing both halves is NOT this check. It compares a text with its
 * own paraphrase of itself.
 *
 * ## Both agents are recorded, and only one of them rules
 *
 * The adjudicator's entry carries the verdict and leads the criterion, because
 * the first entry per criterion is the operative one everywhere in this repo.
 * The back-translator's entry sits behind it with `result: "n/a"` and the
 * back-translation itself in `notes`: it did not rule on anything, but a reader
 * asking "on what basis?" needs the intermediate text, and a reader asking "who
 * did this?" needs both names.
 *
 * ## What staleness means here, and why it is worth more than the verdict
 *
 * The entries hash the `.md`, the `.ts` and the `.po`. Edit the source and
 * every locale's round trip goes STALE; edit the translation and that locale's
 * does. So a verdict from a pair of agents cannot quietly outlive the text it
 * was about — which matters more for an agent ruling than for a script one,
 * because nobody can cheaply re-run it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run content/pipeline/translation-roundtrip.ts --payload <file.json>
 *
 * The payload is {@link RoundTripPayload}. It is written by whatever ran the
 * agents — this module does not call a model itself, deliberately: the
 * recording must work the same whether the pair was two subagents, two
 * API calls, or two people.
 *
 * @module content/pipeline/translation-roundtrip
