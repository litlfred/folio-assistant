/**
 * `.pot` templates for the published pages that have no catalogue.
 *
 * ## Why this exists, and what it deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * `translation:drift:check` fails on a page that is published in a locale with
 * no `.po` beside it. On 2026-09-26 that is **25** pages — the 5 × 5 grid of
 * `accessibility` / `content-types` / `contributing` / `getting-started` /
 * `installation` × `ar` / `es` / `fr` / `ru` / `zh` — and `main` carries that
 * red BY DECISION (bean `ngxj`, issue #206). The owner chose the remedy on
 * 2026-09-26: **get the catalogues authored**, not record their absence.
 *
 * **This does not turn the gate green, and must not be read as trying to.** A
 * `.pot` is a translator's INPUT; the gate wants a `.po`, which is a
 * translator's OUTPUT. What this removes is the reason a translator cannot
 * start: measured the same day, not one of those 25 pages had a `.pot` OR a
 * `.po` in any locale, so the campaign had nothing to be handed.
 *
 * Bean `f6r1` is why generating the `.po` is not on the table: of 27 such
 * translations, **19 are provably not derivable** from the published text (the
 * segment counts differ by ~20, so deriving would mean deciding which segments
 * went untranslated and which were merged) and 8 are undetermined, with 0
 * demonstrated derivable. Authoring is human work. Extraction is not.
 *
 * ## The page list is DERIVED, never written down here
 *
 * It comes from `translation-drift`'s own findings, so this cannot disagree
 * with the gate it exists to serve. A hardcoded list of five names would be a
 * second answer to "which pages need a catalogue", free to drift the moment one
 * is finished — and the whole subject here is a record going stale against a
 * corpus that moved on.
 *
 * ## Reuses the extractor, adds nothing to it
 *
 * `extractMarkdown` + `formatPot` from `pot-extract.ts`, called the same way
 * the `translation_extract` MCP tool calls them. That tool could already do
 * this one page at a time; what was missing was a runnable entry point over
 * the SET the gate names, which is why this is 40 lines and not a parser.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run translation:pot              # write a .pot per (locale, page) needing one
 *   bun run translation:pot -- --check   # exit 1 if any is missing or stale
 *   bun run translation:pot -- --json    # the plan, written nowhere
 *
 * Exit: 0 wrote or all current, 1 `--check` found one missing or stale,
 *       2 could not determine — the drift report named no page.

 * call sites in this repository use it (`join(INSTANCE_ROOT, siteDirFor(...))`).

/**
 * Page templates this module ALREADY OWNS, whatever the trigger set says today.
 *
 * ## Why the derived set alone is not the subject
 *
 * `needingCatalogue` answers *"which page needs a catalogue NOW"*, and that set
 * moves: a page that gains a `.po` leaves it, which is the property that makes
 * the derivation right. But the `.pot` beside that `.po` does not stop being
 * this module's output — and a generator that stops maintaining an artefact the
 * moment its trigger clears is a generator that MANUFACTURES stale files.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-26, which is why this exists: 25 templates were written for
 * the five pages then uncatalogued; `main` then reworked `pot-extract.ts` by 284
 * lines and four of those five pages left the set. All 20 of their templates
 * went stale, no gate could see it, and `translation:pot -- --check` reported
 * clean because the pairs were no longer in scope. A `--check` whose SCOPE
 * shrinks away from its own output cannot fail on it.
 *
 * ## The boundary is a DIRECTORY, not a name pattern
 *
 * `translations/<locale>/processes/*.pot` belongs to `translate-bpmn.ts`, whose
 * subject is a `.bpmn` rather than a page. Reading only the top level of each
 * locale — `readdirSync` with no recursion — puts that ownership split in the
 * traversal instead of in a filter, so the two generators cannot collide by
 * one of them being taught a new name. A pattern would have had to guess, and
 * `docs/processes/<name>.md` DOES exist, so a source-exists test alone would
 * have adopted all 58 of the other module's templates.
