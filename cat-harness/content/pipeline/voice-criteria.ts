/**
 * The voice-overlay QA criteria, DERIVED from the voices rather than written
 * out one per voice.
 *
 * ## What was here before, and what it cost
 *
 * `qa-criteria-registry.ts` carried four hand-written entries —
 * `voice-overlay-who-editorial`, `-who-guideline-development`,
 * `-who-publication-design` and `-milnor` — each restating that voice's rules
 * in prose. Three of them described files in ANOTHER INSTANCE
 * (`who-style-guide`), and every one of them restated rules **without the
 * citation the voice itself carries**. So the platform held an uncited copy of
 * rules the owning instance holds cited, in the one subsystem whose whole
 * argument is that a voice is auditable rather than asserted. Bean `btuv`;
 * `check-voices.ts` exists because PR #210 shipped ten plausible rules with
 * `source: null`.
 *
 * It was generic machinery HAND-INSTANTIATED per voice, which is why the
 * content leaked in: there was no way for an instance to contribute a
 * criterion, so a voice shipping anywhere had to be written into the platform
 * by hand. Now a voice shipping in any instance gets its criterion with no
 * platform edit at all, and the platform holds no instance's rules.
 *
 * ## The description names the voice; it does not restate it
 *
 * The four hand-written descriptions enumerated each voice's rules — 402 to 602
 * characters of prose per voice. The derived one says what the voice IS, where
 * it came from, how many rules it carries and where to read them. That is a
 * deliberate loss of detail: the detail was exactly the uncited restatement,
 * and a reader who needs it follows the citation to the rule that carries its
 * page and quote.
 *
 * ## Lazy, and that is forced rather than preferred
 *
 * Deriving means reading the filesystem. `QA_CRITERIA_REGISTRY` is a
 * module-scope `const`, and module-scope filesystem work is what bean `1hkj`
 * deferred and what `check:module-scope-resolution` now gates — a malformed
 * declaration must not be able to abort a module and strand its exports. So
 * these are computed on first call and memoised per instance root, never at
 * import.
 *
