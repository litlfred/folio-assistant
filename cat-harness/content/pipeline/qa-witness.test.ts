/**
 * The witness projection has one job the icon never had: saying whether a
 * verdict still holds. Everything below is about the ways that can be got
 * wrong quietly.
 *
 * The expensive failure is not `stale` reported as `fresh` — it is `unknown`
 * reported as `fresh`. A comparison that could not be made looks exactly like
 * one that succeeded unless the code refuses to guess, and a reader shown
 * "current" for a verdict nobody can date will act on it.
