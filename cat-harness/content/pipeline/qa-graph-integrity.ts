/**
 * Every document in every declared `qa` directory must be readable: no git
 * conflict markers, and every `.json` parses.
 *
 * Bean `de9k`, defect C1 of the reader audit
 * (`cat-harness/docs/proposals/qa-readers-audit-2026-10-01.md` §4.1).
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * Merge `48aab0bd` committed git conflict markers into three `kg-qa/v1`
 * sidecars, in the HOSTED homes `cat-harness/test/results/bootstrap/` and
 * `…/bootstrap-tools/`. Three things made the damage invisible:
 *
 * - every reader that tolerates a parse error treated those files as absent
 *   (`readAttestations` and `readVoiceReviews` returned `[]`; since bean
 *   `2gst` they read the attestation store and answer `corrupt` instead);
 * - `readQaGraph` counted them as "3 unreadable", and nothing fails on that
 *   count;
 * - `kg-qa.test.ts` validates only `test/results/kg-qa/**`, so it never saw
 *   the hosted homes.
 *
 * A tolerant reader is the right reader for a corpus that may be partly
 * written. It is the wrong place to discover a corrupt corpus, so the
 * corruption needs a check of its own. It goes here, and not in any one
 * family's schema test.
 *
 * ## Scope: the DECLARED directories, of every instance
 *
 * The directories come from each instance's `<instance>.json`. They are never
 * hardcoded under a path, because a hardcoded path is how the hosted homes went
 * unseen. A walk covers everything below a declared root, so a hosted home is
 * covered as soon as its host is.
 *
 * ## What counts as a marker
 *
 * A line that starts with seven or more `<` or `>` followed by a space or the
 * end of the line. This merge wrote EIGHT, because git widens the marker for a
 * rename/rename conflict, so a check for exactly seven would have missed it.
 * The `=======` separator is deliberately not matched alone: it is a legal
 * setext heading underline in Markdown, and the two outer markers always come
 * with it.
