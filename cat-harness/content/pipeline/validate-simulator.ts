/**
 * Does a simulator block's `html:` target actually exist?
 *
 * Bean `023p`. Before this, `validate.ts` contained **no reference to
 * `simulator` or `.html`** — a simulator block declared
 * `html: "simulators/x.html"` and nothing in the pipeline asked whether that
 * file was on disk. Measured 2026-09-19 on qou: two of eleven simulator
 * targets, `descent_rate_probe.html` and `multi_level_jet_sum.html`, existed
 * in neither repository, had been dangling on `main` before any branch touched
 * them, and `run-validate` exited **0** with three issues, none of them about
 * a simulator. Both dangling blocks passed clean.
 *
 * `SimulatorBlock`'s own doc comment claimed *"Pipeline validates: .html
 * companion exists"*. It did not. A documented check that does not run is
 * worse than an absent one, because a reader stops looking.
 *
 * ## Three states, and the third is the point
 *
 * - **present** — resolved and on disk. Silent.
 * - **absent** — resolved and not there. A finding.
 * - **could-not-determine** — an `http(s)` target, or a path that escapes the
 *   folio root. Reported as its own thing and **never rendered as clean**,
 *   which is the rule this repository applies to `ci-health`, `kg:audit` and
 *   `folioDir` alike.
 *
 * A remote simulator is a legitimate arrangement; this module cannot fetch it,
 * and silence would make "I did not look" indistinguishable from "I looked and
 * it was fine".
 *
 * ## `todo-html` is a claim, not a check
 *
 * Both qou cases carry `tags: [..., "todo-html", ...]`, recording an author's
 * intent to write the file later. Nothing read that tag, nothing reconciled it
 * against disk, and a block that LOST the tag while keeping the dead path was
 * reported by nobody.
 *
 * So a tagged block is reported as a **deferred stub** rather than dropped
 * from the count: an intentional absence is still an absence, and *how many
 * are deferred* is the number an author needs. It is a `warning`; an untagged
 * dangling target is an `error`.
 *
