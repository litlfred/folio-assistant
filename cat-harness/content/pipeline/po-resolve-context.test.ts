/**
 * `poResolveContext` — the folio-level half of PO resolution, built once.
 *
 * Bean `ksg3`: a sweep that rebuilt the instance graph per (block, locale)
 * spent 98% of `translation-block-qa --check` doing it. Passing the context in
 * is only a speed-up if it changes NOTHING about what resolves, so every case
 * here asserts the two calls agree — same files, same order, same labels.
 *
 * A file of its own rather than a block in `po-resolve.test.ts`, whose fixture
 * header another branch is rewriting; the fixture here is under the system
 * temp directory for the reason `dlqu` gives there.
