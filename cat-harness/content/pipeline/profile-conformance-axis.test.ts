/**
 * The `profile-conformance` QA axis — bean `0bzg`.
 *
 * `checkFolioProfile` catches what schema validation STRUCTURALLY cannot: a block
 * valid against its own schema but wrong for the folio's content profile, because
 * adapters partition disjointly while profiles nest. Until this axis it had no
 * shell entry point at all — its only caller registered MCP tools — so CI could
 * never ask the question. The owner chose a `qa-sweep` axis over a `check:profile`
 * script because a sweep verdict is durable where a printed one is not.
 *
 * ## What these tests are for, specifically
 *
 * **Reaching every state, not just the one this repository happens to produce.**
 * The platform declares no `contentType`, so a test that only ran the axis here
 * would see `n/a` forever and prove nothing about `pass` or `fail`. That is the
 * "filter over nothing" trap: an axis whose only demonstrated state is
 * could-not-determine looks implemented and checks nothing.
 *
 * **The `n/a`-vs-`pass` boundary, which the first version of the axis got
 * wrong.** It guarded on `ProfileCheckResult.profile === undefined`, and that
 * field is never `undefined`: `checkFolioProfile` resolves through
 * `readFolioProfile`, which turns an undeclared profile into `"paper"` — correct
 * for a validator, since the wider vocabulary is the safe thing to validate
 * against. So the guard never fired and the axis reported **`pass` on a folio
 * that declares nothing**, which is precisely the laundering it exists to
 * prevent. Caught by running it, not by reading it.
