/**
 * Resolve a content profile's render target from its declaration.
 *
 * The renderer half of `qa-checker-discovery.ts`, and the same three
 * properties: the module specifier is a VARIABLE so this module depends on
 * neither renderer and `repo-partition` records no edge; resolution happens
 * once rather than per block; and "there is no target" is a determined,
 * reportable state rather than a silent pass.
 *
 * Contributed targets win over the built-in table. A dependency that brings a
 * render target for a profile has said something more specific than the
 * platform default, and the platform's own entry is the fallback — which is
 * the opposite of the block-kind rule next door, where a contributed kind may
 * never shadow a platform one. The difference is what shadowing COSTS: a
 * shadowed `theorem` changes what every existing folio validates against,
 * while a shadowed render target changes only how this folio typesets, which
 * is the folio's business.
 *
