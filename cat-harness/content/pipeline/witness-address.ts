/**
 * Where a Lean witness LIVES, and whether one is there.
 *
 * @module content/pipeline/witness-address
 *
 * ## Why this is core and the rest of witnessing is not
 *
 * Third time this seam has appeared, and the test is the same each time —
 * `schemas/lean-packages.ts` (the `lean.ref` grammar), `content/pipeline/
 * lean-lexer.ts` (comment stripping and declaration splitting), and now this:
 * **would core function without the science layer installed?**
 *
 * It would not. `BlockBase` carries an optional `lean` field, and
 * `export-json.ts` — the generic exporter, which a document folio runs as much
 * as a paper one — emits `witnessed` for every block that has one. Answering
 * that question is two lines of arithmetic: hash the file, look for a sibling
 * at the hash-derived name.
 *
 * What is genuinely the science layer's is everything that PRODUCES or
 * INVALIDATES a witness — `stampWitness`, `clearWitnesses`, `isStale`,
 * `readWitnessMeta`, `findAllWitnesses` — because those run proofs, read git
 * history and manage a lifecycle. Those stay in `scripts/lean-witness.ts`,
 * which re-exports these three so its own callers are unaffected.
 *
 * The distinction is the one that keeps recurring: **naming a thing is
 * grammar; doing something with it is tooling.**
