/**
 * Find a criterion's checker by asking the graph, not by importing it.
 *
 * `qa-sweep.ts` dispatched like this:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const checker = AUTOMATED_CHECKERS[id] ?? DAK_AUTOMATED_CHECKERS[id];
 * ```
 *
 * — the generic sweep naming one adapter's checker table. That is a
 * wrong-direction dependency (core → smart-base) and it does not generalise:
 * a third adapter is a third `??`, and a folio bringing its own criteria has
 * nowhere to put them.
 *
 * ## The graph already knows
 *
 * Every automated criterion declares where its checker lives —
 * `QaCriterionDefinition.source_file`, resolved through
 * `getCriterionSourceFile()`. That field already exists and is already
 * load-bearing: it is what `script_hash` is computed over, so a criterion
 * pointed at the wrong file never invalidates.
 * `scripts/tests/qa-criterion-source-file.test.ts` pins declared == actual for
 * every automated criterion, which is exactly the guarantee discovery needs.
 *
 * So the dispatch table was a second answer to a question the registry already
 * answered, and the two were free to disagree.
 *
 * ## Why this removes an import edge rather than hiding one
 *
 * The module specifier is a **variable**, read from the criterion.
 * `repo-partition` counts a dynamic `import("./literal")` as an edge and a
 * variable one as no edge, and that is the right distinction rather than a
 * loophole: the edge disappears exactly when the target stops being
 * hardcoded. Nothing here names `qa-checkers-dak.ts`; it is reached because a
 * `dak-*` criterion says so.
 *
 * ## Two subjects, declared not inferred
 *
 * A criterion audits a **block** (its checker takes {@link CheckerPaths}) or a
 * **script** (its checker takes a path string). Discovery partitions on the
 * declared `subject` field, never on the domain name: `script-quality` is a
 * bucket label, and a second script axis under any other name would otherwise
 * be handed to the block sweep and receive a `CheckerPaths` object where its
 * checker expects a string.
 *
 * ## Resolved once, up front
 *
 * The sweep's inner loop is synchronous and hot, so discovery is one pass
 * before it and the loop reads a Map. A criterion whose module exports no
 * checker is **reported**, not silently folded into "needs an agent":
 * "declared automated but nothing implements it" and "deliberately needs an
 * agent" are different facts with different fixes, and the sweep already
 * records the second.

 * import cycle anywhere:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // boom.ts:  export const BEFORE = 1; const _ = explode(); export const AFTER = {};
 * await import("./boom.ts");             // REJECTS: "top-level failure"

 * nothing.
 *
 * **That quirk is a runtime's, not a contract**, and saying otherwise cost a
 * red CI: a test pinned it and went red under `bun-version: latest` while
 * passing locally on 1.3.11, which does not re-reject. The caching does not
 * depend on which way it goes. What holds on every runtime is that **a module
 * that threw is never re-evaluated**, so asking again can only return the same
 * error or something worse — never a better answer. Caching keeps the cause
 * either way, and on a runtime that hands back the half-built namespace it is
 * also what stops `readModule` ever seeing one. Several criteria share one checker file, so discovery imported the
 * same path once per criterion and hit exactly that: the first got the real
 * error, and every one after it got the half-built namespace that
 * {@link readModule} exists to survive.
 *
 * Caching keeps the CAUSE. Without it the first criterion reports
 * `cold-chain-guidance.config.json is not valid JSON` and its siblings report
 * "module did not finish evaluating" — the symptom {@link readModule}
 * correctly declines to guess past. One broken checker module should be one
 * finding, stated once, in the words of the thing that actually failed.

/**
 * A module namespace read safely, or `undefined` when it CANNOT BE READ AT
 * ALL — which means the module threw while evaluating.
 *
 * ## What actually happens, corrected 2026-09-21
 *
 * This was introduced (PR #695) with the diagnosis *"the module is part of an
 * import cycle and is being read while it is mid-evaluation"*. **That was
 * wrong, and measuring said so**: the import graph has 950 modules and exactly
 * two strongly-connected components, and neither contains
 * `qa-checkers-extended.ts`. There is no cycle.
 *
 * The real mechanism is a **module-scope side effect that throws**.
 * `qa-checkers-extended.ts` opens with `const REPO_ROOT =
 * findContentRepoRoot()`, and that resolved through a declaration which would
 * not parse. Evaluation aborted at line 49, so `EXTENDED_AUTOMATED_CHECKERS`
 * three thousand lines below was never bound — and a later `await import()`
 * handed back the half-built namespace rather than re-throwing. Reading any
 * binding on it, or even enumerating its keys, then raises "Cannot access X
 * before initialization", naming a symptom three thousand lines from the
 * cause.
 *
 * `findContentRepoRoot` no longer throws there (same PR), but the shape
 * remains reachable: a dozen pipeline modules do filesystem work at module
 * scope, and any of them can fail the same way.
 *
 * ## Why the namespace is read through here at all
 *
 * `Object.keys` ITSELF throws on such a namespace — the ownKeys trap
 * evaluates — so the guard has to wrap the enumeration rather than each read.
 *
 * **And the failure has to keep its own name.** The first version returned an
 * empty list, which made `discoverFor` report *"exports neither a dispatch-
 * table entry nor check<Id>()"* — a DETERMINED, FALSE statement about a module
 * nobody could read. Returning `undefined` is what lets the caller say "did
 * not load" instead, which is the difference between a third state and a
 * wrong answer.
