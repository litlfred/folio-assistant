The harness's own schemas, drawn from the JSON Schemas they are generated from,
in four packages. **test** holds the KG QA report and the test run. **process**
holds the task and the OMG BPMN 2.0 process. **scenario** holds actor, role,
user story, voice and skill. **schema** holds JSON Schema and external schema. An actor
takes on roles, a role carries skills, a task sits in a lane of a role and uses
a skill, a test run tests a skill, and a QA report audits any kind of subject.
