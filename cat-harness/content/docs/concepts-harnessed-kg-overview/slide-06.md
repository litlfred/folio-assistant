An **agent** uses **skills** to execute one or more **tasks** in a **process**.
It works with a knowledge graph of static context (skills, user stories) and
dynamic context. A skill may have zero or more **tools**, used for **test**
execution anywhere on the deterministic-to-agentic spectrum.

- **Role:** played by a human, agentic or mechanical actor; a swimlane in BPMN.
- **Task:** a step in a process; a node in BPMN.

![Folio lifecycle — one cycle, plan to retire. A BPMN collaboration of six lanes: programme manager, work plan (beans shared by humans and agents), editors and authoring agents, validation and QA, review team and SMEs, publication manager. Tasks in order: plan scope, team and artefacts; seed the work plan; editing and HCI validation; integration test and QA sweep; draft, review and publish; triage published feedback; file feedback as beans; then a gateway, more content, which loops back to editing or ends in retire or archive.](assets/img/workflows/content-lifecycle.svg)

**How the slide labels the diagram.** On the slide the terms sit around the
BPMN picture and lines tie each one to a part of it:

- **Process** points at the whole diagram, captioned *(publication lifecycle)*,
  with *(Context)* beside it.
- **User Story** is tied to **Role**, and **Role** to one lane, the one labelled
  *Editor* (editors and authoring agents).
- **Task** points at one node in that lane, *Edit Doc* (today: editing and HCI
  validation).
- **Skill** hangs off that task, and **Test** hangs off the skill.
- The beans icon sits by agentic state and the sticky note by human state.

So the slide says a user story names a role, a role is a lane, a task is a node
in it, a skill belongs to a task, and a test belongs to a skill.

> lanes and the same eight tasks.
