SMART Base publishes a JSON Schema, and an OpenAPI description, for every DAK
logical model and value set. Examples are the decision-support logic, health
interventions, functional and non-functional requirements, program indicator,
core data element, persona and business-process workflow models, the Dublin
Core metadata set, and value sets such as the classification of digital health
interventions. A source reference such as `DecisionSupportLogicSource` must give
exactly one of `url`, `canonical` or an inline `instance`.

On the slide the JSON Schema is drawn over the list as a callout of one entry,
`DecisionSupportLogicSource`, so it reads as "this is what one of these
entries holds". The QR code beside it points at the API page.

`smart-base/fhir-artifact-index`.

> **Aligned in count, not checked item by item:** the slide shows "Logical

> StructureDefinition pages.
