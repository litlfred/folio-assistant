WHO's public-health information is split between literature repositories, **IRIS**
(DSpace), and structured indicators in the **World Health Data Hub**. Unifying
them into one knowledge graph needs a platform with room to grow to about
**10 TB**, with high throughput and without high network costs.

| problem | proposed answer |
|---|---|
| Egress fees make serving 10 TB globally unpredictable | a zero-egress public CDN holding signed static assets |
| Automated traffic, above all in emergencies, can overload internal systems | decouple: an internal secure origin, published snapshots outside it |
| Authenticity and chain of custody in an era of AI-generated content | sign every published asset (WHO Trust Network gateway) |

The architecture drawn on the slide runs in three stages. An internal secure
origin (IRIS and the Data Hub) feeds an automated compile engine: folio-assistant
builds, signs, snapshots and publishes. That engine feeds a public CDN, named on
the slide as Cloudflare R2 storage and the Cloudflare edge network.

Middle, &quot;Automated compile engine — build, sign, snapshot, publish&quot;: folio-assistant (auto-sign and snapshot), feeding &quot;Cryptographic asset signing&quot; via the WHO Trust Network Gateway and Swiss Observatory schemas. Right, &quot;Zero-egress public CDN&quot;: Cloudflare R2 storage (10 TB) of signed static assets, then the Cloudflare CDN edge network for global low-latency delivery, reaching global researchers.

`large-datasets` (the WHO IRIS source descriptor); `who-iris` (the DSpace skill).

> **Misaligned — proposal, not decision:** the repository treats the CDN as a
> swappable layer. `kg-to-portal` and `large-datasets`' artifact store name
> Cloudflare and R2 only as examples beside GitHub Pages, jsDelivr and S3. The
> slide names Cloudflare as *the* choice. Before this deck, the 10 TB figure,
> the World Health Data Hub and "Swiss Observatory schemas" appeared nowhere in
> the repository. The decision is now recorded, as **proposed, with no outcome yet**, in bean
> `l9v6` (MADR form). It holds the drivers, three real options (Cloudflare R2 +
> CDN, GitHub Pages alone, another object store + CDN) and what has to be
> measured before one is chosen. Read this slide as that proposal.
