The DAK logical model (SMART Base 1.0.0) is a complete kit with its metadata
(id, name, title, description, version, status, publication, preview and
canonical URLs, licence, copyright year, publisher) and its components: nine in this model, ten by the owner's count (see slide 3). Each
component is held as a **source reference**, not inline: by URL, by canonical or
as an instance. That indirection is what lets the kit's parts be nodes of a
larger graph.
