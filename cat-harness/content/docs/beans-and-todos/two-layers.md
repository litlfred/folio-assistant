Two different things can change a bean, and a step that confuses them will
announce an effect it does not have.

**The workflow engine** performs `claim`, `note` and `resolve` on a process
instance's own bean when a step marked `<cat-harness.processes:bean op="…"/>` completes.
`claim` sets `in-progress` and is idempotent; `note` appends; `resolve`
completes the bean **only once the instance itself has completed**, because
whether work is done is a judgement and a bean is not closed on someone else's
say-so.

**The agent** does everything else with the `beans` CLI: creating, scrapping,
retitling, setting a blocker. The engine has no operation for any of these.

This is not a hypothetical distinction. An activity in the CRDM diagram
carried `<cat-harness.processes:bean action="create"/>` — `action`, where the engine reads
`op` — so it parsed as no operation at all. The step advertised that sign-off
produced beans, performed nothing, and did so silently until somebody read the
parser.

**When you add a bean-marked step,** use one of the three operations the
engine implements, and say in the step's documentation which parts are the
agent's own CLI calls. `bun run check:workflow-refs` will catch a skill
reference that does not resolve; it cannot catch a plausible attribute the
engine never reads.
