The CRDM workflow is supported by skills and tools that the agent uses at each
phase. Some exist today; others are proposed.

### Existing capabilities

| Capability | Used in phase | How |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub issue management** | All phases | Issues are the primary artefact for requirements, impact analysis, and sign-off. Agents reach GitHub through the MCP tools, not the `gh` CLI, which is not available in every harness |
| **BPMN workflow authoring** (skill: `bpmn-authoring`) | Phase 2 | Agent can create and modify BPMN 2.0 process diagrams |
| **Content graph** (`content-graph.ts`) | Phase 4 | Dependency analysis across blocks and chapters |
| **QA criteria registry** (`qa-criteria-registry.ts`) | Phase 3, 4 | Register and scope new QA checks |
| **Beans** (`beans` CLI) | Phase 5, 6 | Work-plan creation and tracking |
| **Content validation** (`content_validate` MCP tool) | Phase 6 | Verify changes against schema and constraints |
| **Schema types** (`schemas/*.ts`) | Phase 3 | Define new types, constraints, and builders |
| **Document ingestion** (`uploads/` → `library/` pipeline) | Phase 2 | Ingest source documents for review |

### Skills that now exist

| Skill | Phase | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **`crdm-detect`** | Trigger | Recognise when a request is a feature rather than content. Five categories of detection phrasing, an explicit "not a feature request" list, and the session-state rules |
| **`crdm-requirements-workflow`** | All phases | The six-phase process, the actors table, and the issue-association rules |

Both are guidance, not instrumentation: they tell an agent what to do, and
nothing checks that it did. See "What is not built yet" for why that
distinction is kept explicit.

### Proposed skills

| Skill | Phase | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **`crdm-needs-assessment`** | Phase 1 | Guide the user through needs articulation; identify stakeholders |
| **`crdm-impact-analysis`** | Phase 4 | Automated scan of affected schemas, pipeline scripts, adapters, and folios |
| **`crdm-requirements-template`** | Phase 3 | Generate structured requirements from conversation |
| **`review-triage`** | Phase 6 | Triage review comments from ingested documents (e.g. public consultation feedback) |

### Running the process — it is already executable

**`crdm_start` and `crdm_status` were proposed here and should not be built.**
The generic workflow tools already run this process, because
`processes/crdm-requirements.bpmn` is a loadable BPMN process like every
other diagram in this repository:

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `crdm_start` | `workflow_start` with `crdm-requirements` and the bean the work hangs on |
| `crdm_status` | `workflow_next` — what is enabled now, which lane owns it, which skill implements it |
| a phase checklist | `workflow_complete`, which **refuses a step that is not enabled**, so phases cannot be claimed out of order |

A second set of tools over the same diagram would be a second answer to
"where are we", free to disagree with the first. State lives under
`beans/workflows/` and is committed, so a sibling session sees the same
position — which is the property a chat-local phase tracker could never have.

Every activity in the agent's lane carries the skill that implements it, so
`workflow_next` returns something actionable rather than a step name:

| Step | Skill |
|---|---|
| Detect feature request | `crdm-detect` |
| Scan / link / ask about the issue | `crdm-requirements-workflow` |
| Phase 1 — stakeholders, synthesise needs | `crdm-requirements-workflow` |
| Phase 2 — map the current workflow | `bpmn-authoring` |
| Phases 3–4 — requirements and impact | `crdm-requirements-workflow` + `content-graph` |
| Phase 5 — create beans | `todo-manager` |
| Phase 6 — implement | `prepare-merge` |
| Post the round summary | `delivery-summary` |
| Close the issue | `crdm-requirements-workflow` |

Three steps also carry a work-plan effect the engine performs: implementing
claims the bean, creating beans notes it, and closing resolves it — and
resolve only lands once the instance itself has completed, because whether
work is done is a judgement.

### `stakeholder_map` — built, but not from the sources proposed

It was specified here as reading "affected roles from `harness.config.json` and
CODEOWNERS". **Neither exists.** This repository has no CODEOWNERS file, and
`schemas/harness-config.ts` declares no role, owner, maintainer or contact
field. Built as written, the tool would have reported no stakeholders for
every change, forever, and looked like it worked.

It reads what the repository actually has:

1. **Skills declare `roles:`** in their front matter — reader, collaborator,
   owner, auditor. Change a skill and you affect whoever holds its roles.
2. **BPMN lanes name the accountable actor**, and each activity names the
   skill that implements it. So a changed skill reaches a set of lanes across
   the whole process corpus — editors, the publication manager, clinical SMEs.

That second hop is the one CODEOWNERS could never have given: changing
`todo-manager.md` reaches the work-plan lane in six separate processes,
which is a far better prompt for "who should hear about this?" than a list
of file owners.

**It does not name people, deliberately.** `crdm-requirements.bpmn` documents
its own stakeholder step as *"The agent asks the BA who is affected by this
change. The BA knows the domain — the agent does not guess."* The tool
respects that: it enumerates roles, lanes and processes so the BA is asked a
sharper question, and it never outputs a list of humans as "the
stakeholders". Every report ends with a **NOT DETERMINED** section naming the
people half, any changed path that maps to no skill (unknown impact, not
absent impact), and any skill whose `roles:` are undeclared.

`bun run stakeholder-map <path>...` or `--since <ref>`; `stakeholder_map` as
an MCP tool.
