Once requirements are signed off and beans are created, the agent and BA
enter the **iterative MVP development cycle**. This is where the feature
gets built, tested, and refined until stakeholders accept it.

### The inner loop: BA ↔ Agent

The BA and agent work together in tight iterations:

```
                ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
                │              INNER LOOP                  │
                │                                          │
                │   Agent                        BA        │
                │   ┌─────────┐    PR + demo    ┌──────┐  │
                │   │Implement├───────────────►│Review │  │
                │   │ (bean)  │                │ + test│  │
                │   │         │◄───────────────┤       │  │
                │   └─────────┘   feedback      └──────┘  │
                │                                          │
                └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Agent claims a bean** — implements the requirement on a feature
   branch, opens a PR, posts a summary to the issue.
2. **BA reviews** — tests the feature, compares it against the requirement
   and acceptance criteria from Phase 3. The BA does not need to read code;
   they test the *behaviour*.
3. **Feedback or accept** — the BA either requests changes (the agent
   iterates) or accepts the increment.
4. **Repeat** until the bean is resolved.

Each bean produces a **minimum viable increment** — not the whole feature,
but one requirement satisfied. The BA decides when enough increments have
accumulated to show stakeholders.

### The outer loop: BA → Stakeholders

When the BA judges that the delivered increments constitute an **MVP worth
testing**, they bring stakeholders in:

```

   │                      OUTER LOOP                              │
   │                                                              │
   │   BA                          Stakeholders                   │
   │   ┌──────────┐   MVP demo   ┌────────────────┐              │

   │   │          │◄─────────────┤                │              │
   │   └──────────┘   findings   └────────────────┘              │
   │        │                                                     │
   │        ▼                                                     │
   │   Translate findings into                                    │
   │   agent-actionable feedback                                  │
   │   (new beans or bean updates)                                │
   │        │                                                     │
   │        ▼                                                     │
   │   Re-enter inner loop                                        │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **BA shares the MVP** — the staging URL, a demo, or a walkthrough. The
   BA frames it: "here is what we built, here is what it does, here is
   what we need you to test."
2. **Stakeholders test** — in their own context, with their own data,
   against their own workflows. They report what works and what does not.
3. **BA translates findings** — stakeholder feedback is domain language
   ("the table doesn't show the right columns"). The BA translates it
   into actionable direction for the agent ("the `review-triage` view
   needs columns X, Y, Z from the feedback spreadsheet").
4. **Agent iterates** — new beans or updates to existing beans. The inner
   loop resumes.
5. **Repeat** until stakeholders are satisfied.

### The exit: feature sign-off

When all beans for the feature are resolved and stakeholders confirm the
MVP meets their needs:

1. **BA confirms** — all acceptance criteria from Phase 3 are met.
2. **Stakeholders sign off** — on the GitHub issue, not the PR.
3. **Agent closes the issue** — with a delivery summary listing what was
   built, what was deferred, and any new issues opened for future work.
4. **Documentation updated** — the agent updates the docs pages and BPMN
   diagrams to reflect the new capability.

### Why two loops, not one

The inner loop is **fast** — the BA and agent can iterate multiple times
per session. The outer loop is **slow** — stakeholders have other work,
need time to test, and may only be available weekly.

Collapsing them into one loop would either:
- Slow the agent down to the stakeholder cadence (wasting agent time), or
- Rush stakeholders through testing (producing shallow feedback).

The BA absorbs the impedance mismatch. They keep the agent productive in
the inner loop while waiting for stakeholder availability in the outer
loop. Between outer-loop checkpoints, the agent works on other beans or
other features.
