          "BPMN swimlane diagram across four lanes. The author reviews the guidance already in their content, then frames the question as PICO. A parallel gateway fans out to three retrieval tasks run by the evidence agent: trusted L1 sources under library/, trusted L2 DAK and L3 IG content, and data repositories and statistical datasets. The candidates join, and the trusted-registries lane verifies each one's authority against the publishing body's API; an exclusive gateway routes an unconfirmed citation to a bean on the work plan before rejoining. The author then appraises and grades the body of evidence, and a second exclusive gateway asks whether it is sufficient for a recommendation: if not, the gap is recorded as a bean and the process ends without one; if so, the evidence is attached to the recommendation.",
