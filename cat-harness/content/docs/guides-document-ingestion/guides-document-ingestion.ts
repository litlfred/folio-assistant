      // THE BASIC FLOW IS SHOWN HERE RATHER THAN IN A SECTION OF ITS OWN, and
      // the reason is measured. `Process_Ingestion` — the one process this
      // placement keeps in the harness — was presented by no section at all
      // once `the-pipeline` below was repointed at core's refinement (bean
      // `vqlp`): `docs/processes/document-ingestion.md` read "no docs page
      // section shows this diagram", no witness bundle carried that subject,
      // and the `qa-witness` roll-up lost a real failure with it (`fail` 23 to
      // 22) because the finding had nowhere to be recorded.
      //
      // A section of its own would have been the better documentation and was
      // written first. It adds a HEADING, and `translation-drift.ts`'s
      // `shapeOf` compares heading shape: all five localised pages went to
      // "13 heading(s) in the source, 12 here". `KNOWN_DRIFT` is empty and
      // that module calls empty "the goal state, not a lapse", so the choices
      // were to translate into five locales or to regress it. Owner,
      // 2026-10-04, chose this third way instead: the diagram hangs on the
      // section whose prose it already illustrates — uploads and library as
      // two stages of ONE pipeline is exactly what the four steps do — and no
      // heading is added, so nothing drifts and no translation is guessed.
