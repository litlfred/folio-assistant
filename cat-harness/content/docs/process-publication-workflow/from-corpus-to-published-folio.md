Three things to note:

1. **A red draft is fixed in the editing process, not in the artifact.** The
   `no` branch off `Draft QA green?` goes back through the editing call
   activity — which means back through the HCI validation gate. Nobody patches
   a built PDF or a generated IG.
2. **Review is parallel, and both halves must land.** The review team (content
   reviewer, QC reviewer, technical officer) reviews the draft as a publication;
   the clinical or scientific SMEs sign off on the domain content. The join
   waits for both.
3. **Change requests become beans.** A `changes requested` outcome does not
   evaporate into a review thread — each request is opened as a bean, so
   whoever picks the work up next (human or agent) sees exactly what review
   asked for.
