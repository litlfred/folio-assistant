/**
 * What an agent has already read on an issue.
 *
 * #203 (2026-09-18): "make sure human/agentic coders know to check issue for
 * new/updated comments (**keep track of what they already viewed**) to see if
 * it changes current direction or is work to queue."
 *
 * The failure this exists to stop was demonstrated in the session that wrote
 * it: five owner comments landed between 14:31 and 15:55 while the agent
 * worked, each changing direction, and none was seen until the author typed
 * "new comments". Checking once at session start is not checking.
 *
 * ## Why a high-water mark and not a count
 *
 * GitHub comment ids are monotonic per repository, so "everything above N is
 * new" is a total answer that survives deletion, editing and pagination. A
 * count does not: delete one comment and a count says nothing changed.
 *
 * ## Why edits need their own field
 *
 * A comment EDITED after you read it keeps its id, so the id mark alone would
 * call it seen. `updatedAt` is tracked beside it, because the ask says
 * "new/**updated**" and an edited requirement is a changed requirement.
 *
 * ## What this does not do
 *
 * It does not fetch. An agent reads comments through its own GitHub tooling;
 * this records what was read so the NEXT session, in a fresh container, can
 * tell new from already-handled. State lives in the declared `issue-marks/`
 * graph, committed, for the same reason workflow state does: a sibling session
 * must see it.
 *
 * It was `.harness/issue-comments/` until 2026-09-20, and both halves of that
 * name were wrong. A dot-prefixed directory is the one thing this repository's
 * own guard rejects — `.beans/` and `.harness/workflow/` moved out on
 * 2026-09-18 for the same reason — and these files are MARKS, not comments:
 * they carry an id and two timestamps, never a body. A directory named for the
 * comments promises a reader something it does not hold.

/**
 * A mark, as a runnable schema.
 *
 * ## Why this is Zod and `SeenState` is derived from it
 *
 * `SeenState` was a TypeScript interface, so the `issue-marks` kind declared
 * `schema` (where the shape is written) and no `validator` (what can be run) —
 * the exact pair `GraphKindDef.validator` documents as diverging, with `qa` as
 * its worked example. `check:kind-validators` therefore reported this kind as
 * *could not determine* and `audit-coverage` as reached by nothing at all.
 *
 * One source, not two: the interface is `z.infer` of this, so a field added to
 * one cannot go missing from the other.
 *
 * ## `$schema` is REQUIRED, and `saveSeen` was not writing it
 *
 * The two marks committed here carry the tag; `saveSeen` did not write it. That
 * is worse than a cosmetic omission, because `check:kind-validators` routes a
 * node BY its tag and skips a file that has none — so every mark the mechanism
 * wrote would have been passed over silently by the very check this schema
 * exists to feed, and the two hand-written ones would have been the only files
 * ever validated. A validator over the nodes nobody produces is not coverage.
 *
 * Bean `dh4f`'s shape, and `AGENTS.md`'s rule in one line: *extension is a
 * coincidence; a declaration inside the file is the contract.*
