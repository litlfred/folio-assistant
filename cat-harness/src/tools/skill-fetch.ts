// exists to keep that closed.
//
// EXPORTED because reachability is not a property of a manifest: a skill is
// reachable when something can SERVE it. `scripts/kg-audit.ts` reads this table

/**
 * Every servable skill package, discovered from the DECLARED knowledge-graph
 * directories rather than listed by hand.
 *
 * ## Why discovered, and why it took until now
 *
 * This was a hardcoded table, and the cost of that is on the record: a package
 * missing from it is a package `skill_fetch` answers "not found" for, which is
 * how `content-lifecycle` — named by **52** `<folio:skill ref>` activities —
 * was unservable until 2026-09-18.
 *
 * It is discovered through {@link resolveSkillDirs}, which reads each
 * instance's declaration, so a DEPENDENCY's packages are served too. That is
 * the overlay `AGENTS.md` describes as outstanding Phase 0.1 work.
 *
 * ## The filter is the whole design
 *
 * A naive scan of the declared directory is measurably wrong. Taken plainly it
 * adds seven non-package directories — `roles`, `workflows`, `permissions`,
 * `requirements`, `framework`, `remote-packages` and `memory` — and `memory`
 * is the one already on the record for making `kg-audit` write **25 bogus
 * sidecars** against agent-memory nodes that are not instruction bodies.
 *
 * {@link isSkillMd} is what excludes them, and it is **declaration over
 * location**: a markdown file carrying `$schema:` is stating that it is
 * something else. With that filter, discovery reproduces the hand-written
 * table exactly — measured 2026-09-19, no gain and no loss — which is the
 * evidence that this is a refactor and not a behaviour change.
 *
 * ## Later entries win, and that is the overlay order
 *
 * `resolveSkillDirs` returns deepest-dependency-first with the root last, so
 * assigning in order means a root package of the same name overrides a
 * dependency's. Same rule the directory declaration uses, one level down.
