/**
 * `render_order` — the repository's renders, in the order their dependencies
 * imply.
 *
 * The MCP surface over `scripts/render-pipeline.ts`, which is itself the one
 * caller of the generic flattener in `schemas/dependency-order.ts`. An agent
 * asking "what runs before what, and what happens if one fails" gets an
 * answer it can read rather than a YAML file it has to interpret.
 *
 * Generic, not adapter-scoped: the order is a property of the harness
 * instance's declarations, and no block kind enters into it.
