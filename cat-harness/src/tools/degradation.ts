/**
 * What a skill can do when its capabilities are missing — the `degradation`
 * model, executed.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * 24 skill modules declare `requiredCapabilities` with a `degradation`
 * strategy each — 17 `fail`, 6 `fallback`, 1 `warn`. **Nothing read them.**
 * The only consumer was `scripts/generate-docs.ts`, which rendered them and
 * was never invoked in any commit since the root commit; it was retired to
 * `fsh-guts/` on 2026-09-20 (bean `folio-assistant-3w0i`), taking the count
 * of readers to zero. Bean `folio-assistant-ahvw`, owner's decision "b1":
 * enforce it rather than report it or retire it.
 *
 * `src/tools/capabilities.ts` executes the PROBES. This joins their results
 * to what each skill said it would do about them, which is the half that was
 * missing: a probe that nobody consults tells you a tool is absent and not
 * what follows from that.
 *
 * ## Why this is not "just run the skill and see"
 *
 * The integration contract in `docs/proposals/rag-document-ingestion.md` §5
 * rests on **absent tool ⇒ `n/a`, never a false pass** — a document nobody
 * parsed must not read as a document with nothing in it. Discovering
 * absence by running is exactly how that guarantee is lost: the run
 * produces an empty result and an empty result looks like a finding of
 * nothing. Deciding first, from the declaration, is what makes `n/a`
 * expressible.
 *
 * ## The four strategies, and what each MEANS here
 *
 * | strategy | verdict when the capability is absent |
 * |---|---|
 * | `fail` | `blocked` — the skill cannot run, and saying so is the point |
 * | `fallback` | `degraded` if the capability's `fallbackTo` is present, or a human lane takes over; else `blocked` |
 * | `warn` | `degraded` — runnable, with the absence named |
 * | `skip` | `partial` — this requirement is dropped, the skill still runs |
 *
 * `skip` and `warn` differ in what happens to the WORK, not in noise level:
 * `skip` drops the part of the skill that needed the tool, `warn` runs the
 * whole thing on the assumption the tool was optional. Both are `degraded`
 * to a caller that only asks "can this run", which is why the verdict
 * carries the reasons and not just a boolean.
 *
