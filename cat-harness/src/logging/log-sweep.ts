/**
 * Emptying the activity log — one entry, a session, everything older than a
 * date, or all of it.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-19: *"Log is a mechanical role, it can be emptied by an
 * actor all at once or individually. can be periodically emptied."*
 *
 * ## This is the ONE exception to the never-delete rule, and it is narrow
 *
 * [`fsh-guts`](../../skills/folio-core/fsh-guts.md) exists so that nothing is
 * removed with `rm`: a deleted artefact cannot be told from one that never
 * existed, and a scrapped thing records a dead end so the next agent does not
 * re-enter it. A log entry records **no decision**. It is a trace, it is
 * expected to be voluminous, and keeping it forever would drown the directory
 * that exists to make discarded *decisions* findable.
 *
 * So logs may be emptied without confirmation — **and nothing else may.**
 *
 * That sentence is the whole design of this module, because the obvious
 * implementation breaks it. "Empty the log directory" as a directory-level
 * `rm` would delete whatever happens to be sitting there, and the exception
 * was granted to a KIND OF FILE, not to a path. So:
 *
 * **A file is removed only if it declares itself a log entry.** Same
 * `$schema` contract the bean and workflow stores use, and the same reason
 * `#263` gave for it: extension is a coincidence of the current layout, a
 * declaration inside the file is the contract. A stray proposal dropped in
 * `fsh-guts/logs/` keeps every protection it would have had one directory up.
 *
 * **Everything not removed says why.** A sweep that reports only what it
 * deleted leaves "there was nothing to delete" and "there were nine files I
 * refused to touch" looking identical — and the second is the one somebody
 * needs to know about. Third state, same as everywhere else here.
