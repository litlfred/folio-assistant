/**
 * The activity-log producer — the thing that actually writes an entry.
 *
 * `schemas/log-entry.ts` says what an entry IS and where logs live;
 * this says how one gets written. They are separate because the schema is a
 * contract a folio's own tooling may read, and the writer is platform
 * machinery with a filesystem in it.
 *
 * ## Writing and persisting are two different questions
 *
 * Every entry is WRITTEN. The default is that `fsh-guts/logs/` is git-ignored,
 * so an agent can read back what it wrote this session and nothing reaches the
 * data store. `capture: "on"` is what makes an entry ELIGIBLE for the store —
 * it does not itself commit anything, because committing is a decision with a
 * repository behind it and a log writer is not where that belongs.
 *
 * Collapsing the two would give the worse of both: either an audit trail
 * nobody asked for arrives in git, or an agent believes it is keeping one and
 * is not. {@link writeLogEntry} therefore REPORTS which of the three capture
 * states it resolved, on every call, rather than leaving it to be inferred.
 *
 * ## Why it never throws on a write failure
 *
 * A log is instrumentation. An agent whose task fails BECAUSE the logging of
 * that task failed has been made worse off by the thing meant to help it, and
 * the failure is maximally confusing — it points at the log directory rather
 * than at the work. So a write that cannot happen is REPORTED in the result
 * (`written: false` with the reason) and never raised.
 *
 * That is not the same as swallowing it. A silent failure would recreate the
 * exact defect `capture: "unknown"` exists to prevent, one layer down: the
 * agent believes it has a trail and does not. The caller gets the reason and
 * can say so.
