/**
 * The `crdm-detect` phrase signals, and the check that they still say what the
 * skill says.
 *
 * Bean `xfoh`. These lived as literals inside `scripts/eval-crdm-detect.ts`
 * under the comment *"The skill's explicit exclusions"* — a **hand
 * transcription** of a prose list in
 * `skills/crdm/crdm-detect.md`. It had already drifted: the skill
 * listed seven exclusions, the runner implemented five, and the runner's own
 * output reported a false alarm on an issue the skill excludes by name.
 *
 * That is the `jijc` shape — one fact written down twice, free to disagree,
 * with nothing that notices. The fix here is not a second transcription.
 *
 * ## Derive where you can, CHECK where you cannot
 *
 * The skill's exclusion bullets are not one kind of thing, and that is the
 * whole difficulty:
 *
 * | bullet | kind | mechanically usable? |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `"Fix the typo in the overview" — content editing` | a quoted example utterance | yes — a pattern must match it |
 * | `Bug reports about existing features (unless …)` | a category of issue, judged | **no** — no phrase names it |
 *
 * A pattern list cannot be *derived* from the first kind, because the quoted
 * examples carry specifics (`chapter 3`, `chapter 5`) that a usable pattern
 * must generalise away, and generalising is a judgement. But it can be
 * **checked**: every quoted example must be matched by some pattern, and every
 * pattern must have a bullet it comes from. {@link exclusionDrift} is that
 * check, run as a test, so the transcription cannot drift again without a
 * gate going red.
 *
 * The second kind is reported as a **third state** rather than dropped. A
 * phrase matcher structurally cannot implement "bug reports about existing
 * features"; what it can do is say so. {@link parseSkillExclusions} returns
 * them under `judgementOnly`, and the runner prints the count — so a false
 * alarm on a bug report is a DECLARED limit of the mechanical lower bound
 * rather than an unexplained defect in it.
