/**
 * Who is affected by a proposed change — the mechanically determinable part.
 *
 * CRDM phase 1 asks the agent to identify stakeholders, and the CRDM page
 * proposed a `stakeholder_map` tool reading "affected roles from
 * `harness.config.json` and CODEOWNERS".
 *
 * NEITHER SOURCE EXISTS. This repository has no CODEOWNERS file, and
 * `schemas/harness-config.ts` declares no role, owner, maintainer or contact
 * field. A tool built on those two would have reported "no stakeholders" for
 * every change, forever, and looked like it worked.
 *
 * What does exist, and what this reads instead:
 *
 *   1. BPMN LANES name the actor accountable for each activity, and an
 *      activity names the skill that implements it (`<folio:skill ref>`). So
 *      a changed skill reaches a set of lanes across the process corpus —
 *      "editors and authoring agents", "publication manager", "clinical SMEs".
 *   2. Each reached lane RESOLVES to a declared role, through
 *      `roleForLane` against `scenarios/roles.json` — the lane's own
 *      `<folio:role ref>` where it has one, the lane-name table otherwise.
 *
 * ## The source this used to read, and why it went
 *
 * It read `roles:` from each skill's own front matter — *"reader,
 * collaborator, owner, auditor"*. That field was **removed on 2026-09-20**
 * (bean `folio-assistant-qif9`): across 114 skill files it carried 288
 * annotations of which **260 — 90 % — resolved against no declared
 * vocabulary**, and `reader`/`collaborator`/`owner` had never existed as
 * actors in any commit. So "Roles reached: collaborator, owner" was not a
 * thin answer, it was a confident wrong one — and the report gave no way to
 * tell it from a real role, since the two vocabularies shared the field.
 *
 * The identically-named key in a `folio-memory/v1` entry is a DIFFERENT
 * field with a real reader (`memoryForRoles`) and was kept. This module
 * never read those files, so nothing here turns on it — it is noted because
 * "`roles:` was removed" is the kind of sentence a later reader acts on.
 *
 * The local reader was worse than the corpus. `rolesOf` matched only the
 * inline `roles: [a, b]` form, so the 28 files using a block list were read
 * as declaring nothing at all.
 *
 * Lanes were always the better source and were already being computed here.
 * They resolve, they are what the role model actually defines, and a lane
 * that does not resolve is now REPORTED rather than passed through as if it
 * were a role.
 *
 * ON DELIBERATELY NOT GUESSING PEOPLE. `crdm-requirements.bpmn` documents its
 * own stakeholder step as "The agent asks the BA who is affected by this
 * change. The BA knows the domain — the agent does not guess." That is a
 * design decision, not an oversight, and this module respects it: it
 * enumerates roles, lanes and processes, and it NEVER outputs a list of
 * humans as "the stakeholders". The named-people half stays the BA's answer;
 * this exists so the BA is asked a sharper question than "who cares?".

 *
 * ## The list this replaces was already wrong
 *
 * It was five literals — four under `skills/`, plus `src/skills` — and
 * `skillMdDirs()` finds **six** `skills/` packages, so `authoring-math` (3
 * skills) and `authoring-who-smart-guidelines` (9) were invisible to the
 * stakeholder map. Changing one of those twelve files reported no impact:
 * no roles, no lanes, no processes. Exactly the failure `known-skills.ts`'s
 * own header describes for the copy it was extracted to remove — *"a list
 * somebody has to remember to extend is not a single answer; it is a copy
 * that happens to match today"* — and here the copy had already stopped
 * matching.
 *
 * Found by `check:declared-paths` on its first run, which is the argument
 * for that gate: nobody was looking at this file.
 *
 * ## Keyed by PATH, because the name is not unique
 *
 * It was `name → path`, which was safe only while the list omitted
 * `.claude/skills/local/`. Reading the declaration admits it, and
 * `todo-manager.md` exists **three** times — `skills/folio-core/`,
 * `.claude/skills/local/` and the generated mirror, a divergence `AGENTS.md`
 * documents at length. Under `name → path` the last one scanned wins and a
 * change to either of the others reports NO impact: no roles, no lanes,
 * nobody accountable. Indistinguishable from a change that affects nobody,
 * which is the one wrong answer this analysis must not give.
 *
 * `path → name` collides on nothing. Several paths mapping to one skill name
 * is the corpus stating a fact about itself, not a conflict to resolve.
