/**
 * Sessions that are waiting on a person, and have been for too long.
 *
 * Bean `rq8s`. The bean was opened saying *"a session blocked on the owner is
 * invisible"*. Re-measured on claiming, that is **wrong**, and the correction
 * is what this module exists for: the signal is already there, in two fields
 * `list_sessions` returns.
 *
 * | field | what it gives |
 * |---|---|
 * | `session_status: SESSION_STATUS_REQUIRES_ACTION` | a DISTINCT status — not a bucket heuristic — meaning a person must act |
 * | `task_summary` | the held question, in plain text |
 *
 * **Nothing ages them and nothing aggregates them.** Measured 2026-09-21: one
 * session had held *"Which PRs should I merge? I've reviewed none of the maths
 * in them."* for **113.4 hours** in `REQUIRES_ACTION`, and two more had failed
 * 15 and 16 days earlier carrying `unread: true` — output nobody had read.
 * Every one of those facts was one query away and nobody was querying.
 *
 * ## Why this is a module and not a gate
 *
 * **CI cannot fetch the input.** Probed 2026-09-21 from inside a session
 * container: no session credential in the environment,
 * `api.anthropic.com/v1/sessions` → **401**, `claude.ai/api/code/sessions` →
 * **403**. `list_sessions` is an MCP tool an AGENT holds, not an HTTP endpoint
 * a script can call — which is precisely why `sibling-sessions.ts` infers
 * sessions from commit trailers rather than asking.
 *
 * So the rules live here, pure and tested, and the fetch stays with whoever
 * can do it: an agent pipes the listing in. The same split as
 * `who-iris/scripts/catalogue-baseline.ts` — the decisions are testable, the
 * I/O is at the edge. Presenting this as a gate would be worse than not
 * shipping it, because a gate that silently examines nothing reports a clean
 * run over everything, which is the `dh4f` defect this repository keeps
 * paying for.
 *
 * ## `bean-blocking`, one level up
 *
 * That skill requires a blocked BEAN to carry an **expiry**, because a block
 * with no expiry cannot be told from abandoned work. The identical defect runs
 * unchecked on SESSIONS, where the store already holds both the status and the
 * timestamp needed to compute one. This is that rule applied where it was
 * missing.
 *

 * waiting on a person asks the same question from the other side, so it takes

 * FAILED with output nobody has opened is not waiting on anything; it has
 * stopped, and the only question is whether anyone noticed. One working day
 * is the point past which "nobody noticed" is the better explanation.
