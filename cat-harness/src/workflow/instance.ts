/**
 * Run a process from `process-model.ts` as a token machine.
 *
 * The point is not to execute anything — an LLM agent executes, and may take an
 * hour over one activity and be interrupted halfway. The point is that **what
 * may happen next is derived from the diagram rather than asserted by whoever
 * is working**. `Commit into the corpus` does not become enabled until the
 * editor's decision has been recorded, because there is no token on it until
 * then. That is the whole of the determinism on offer.
 *
 * ## Two things can be enabled
 *
 * - an **activity** — work to do, carrying the lane that performs it and the
 *   skill that implements it;
 * - a **decision** — an exclusive gateway reached with no outcome supplied.
 *
 * Decisions are surfaced rather than guessed. In `editing-hci-validation` the
 * parallel fork leads straight into `Judgement call?` with no activity in
 * between, so something has to be asked. Picking a branch silently would be the
 * orchestrator quietly making the call it exists to record.
 *
 * ## What this does not do
 *
 * It does not check that the work was any good. A green process means the gates
 * ran in order and a person saw the findings; whether the content is correct is
 * what the QA axes and the Lean build are for. Do not read a completed instance
 * as a reviewed paper.
