/**
 * Is CI actually green, or has it merely been red for so long that nobody looks?
 *
 * `5rfy` fixed workflows that never **fire** — a header advertising a schedule
 * its `on:` block did not have. This is the opposite defect, and the one that
 * cost more: `docs-site.yml` fired on every push to `main` and **failed all 30
 * times** between 2026-06-29 and 2026-08-26. The published site sat two months
 * stale, and the workflow diagrams merged in #135 never reached it.
 *
 * The trigger was fine. The *outcome* was invisible. From inside the repo a
 * workflow that runs and passes and one that runs and fails look identical, and
 * GitHub's failure email is evidently a channel nobody reads.
 *
 * So this classifies each workflow's recent history on the default branch, and
 * the session-start sweep prints it where attention already goes.
 *
 * ## "Could not check" is not "healthy"
 *
 * Every function here distinguishes *red*, *green* and *unknown*, and the
 * caller must too. A health report that silently treats an unreachable API as
 * fine is the same failure one level up — which is precisely the mistake the
 * sibling-branch section of `session-start-coord-sweep.sh` already refuses to
 * make ("Treat this section as unread, not as empty").

 * "claim nothing".
 *
 * That clause was not foreseen; it was measured. `jsonld-gen-check.yml`
 * declares `on.push` under fifteen `paths:` entries, and the first version of

 * trailer second, on the rationale that the subject is authoritative. Stubbing
 * the order gave a SURVIVING mutation, so the rationale was checked against

 *
 * It was vacuous where it was right: a deploy commit writes `$STAGING_SLUG`

 * a branch called `cleanup` — so two removals for two unrelated PRs became one

 * with itself. A false finding in exactly the direction `3yi4` exists to
