/**
 * Task authorization: the check every BPMN task execution runs first.
 *
 * Issue #1207 (child of #1180). Before an actor performs a task or answers a
 * decision, four questions, in order:
 *
 * 1. **Authenticated** — who is the actor, and how was that established?
 *    ({@link Principal.authenticatedBy}; see `core/access.ts`.)
 * 2. **Assigned** — is the actor eligible for the role the task's lane binds?
 *    (`ActorDef.roles`; empty means unconstrained.)
 * 3. **Authorized** — does an ODRL policy permit `perform-task` in this
 *    process, for this task, as this role?
 * 4. **Access** — the same, with `target` set to the content the task acts on.
 *
 * It is ONE function, generic over every process, and it lives beside the
 * interpreter rather than in any diagram: a check drawn as a task in some
 * processes is a check absent from the rest.
 *
 * ## Advisory, and what that does and does not mean
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-23: advisory first. So:
 *
 * - `deny` from any policy **refuses**. A prohibition is a decision somebody
 *   wrote down.
 * - An actor **not eligible for the lane's role refuses**. Performing a task in
 *   a lane needs the role (`role-model.md`), whatever the policy says.
 * - `unknown` — no rule speaks — **allows, and is recorded as a finding**. It
 *   is never read as permit: the verdict says `unknown`, and `strict` mode
 *   (the option, for when the unknowns reach zero) refuses it.
 * - No actor, or an asserted one, allows in advisory mode and is recorded.
 *
