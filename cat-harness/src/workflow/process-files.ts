 * `kgDirectories`, and on purpose: the export and the renderers rely on it.
 * But since the split the root instance declares no diagram at all — every
 * one belongs to a dependency — so a server started at the repository root
 * listed "Processes: (none)" and could start nothing, which made the

 * resolver changes; the root-only function stays as it is.
