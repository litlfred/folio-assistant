/**
 * The preconditions of a process, asked BEFORE an instance is created.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant/workflow/preflight
 *
 * ## Why this module exists at all
 *
 * `<bootstrap.processes:precondition>` (bean `lv3j`) has been parsed, three-valued and
 * tested since it landed. It has also, until now, had **zero non-test
 * callers**: `workflow_start` created the instance without ever asking. So the
 * repository carried a declaration that reads as a control and enforced
 * nothing — `a58y`'s finding about the `qa-reporting` permission, in the
 * component a pre-execution gate would be built on (issue #853, requirement 3).
 *
 * That is the whole reason the gate is a named module rather than four lines
 * inside the tool handler. `mcp-graph-tools.test.ts` records what happens to
 * logic that lives in a closure inside a request handler: *"the wiring between
 * a declared tool and its implementation was covered by `tsc` and nothing
 * else"* — and both defects in that work typechecked cleanly. A gate whose
 * only proof of life is that it compiles is the defect it exists to catch.
 *
 * ## The three verdicts do three different things
 *
 * | verdict | effect on starting |
 * |---|---|
 * | `unsatisfied` | **refused** — the claim was checked and is false |
 * | `could-not-determine` | started, and **named** in the output |
 * | `satisfied` | started, counted |
 *
 * The middle row is the one worth arguing for. Three of the four preconditions
 * that exist in this repository are `stated`, and `evaluatePrecondition`
 * returns `could-not-determine` for every one of them on its first line — the
 * guarantee is structural, not a rule somebody remembers. Blocking on them
 * would make `initialize-harness` unstartable, which is not a gate, it is an
 * outage. Reading them as satisfied is the `dh4f` shape: a clean run reported
 * over a question nobody could answer.
 *
 * So they are reported. {@link describePreflight} has no silent output — a
 * process with no preconditions says so, in those words. A caller that has to
 * go and look somewhere else to find out whether a gate ran does not have one
 * it can rely on, which is the argument `workflow_start` already makes for
 * `describeCapture` and is applied here for the same reason.
