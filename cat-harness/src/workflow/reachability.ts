/**
 * Can control get to a node, and can it get out — the two structural questions
 * this audit did not ask.
 *
 * Asked 2026-09-23, after a session kept finding the same class by hand: a
 * thing declared and never reached, or reached and never read.
 * `decision-outcomes-used` covers DMN tables and `gateway-branches-named`
 * covers branch labels; neither walks the graph.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in `scripts/kg-audit.ts` because that script runs
 * at import — it ends in `process.exit` with no main guard — so a test
 * importing it would run the whole audit and exit. The same split
 * `src/docs/declaration-claims.ts` uses against its own checker.
 *
 * ## A pre-start gate is NOT unreachable, and getting that wrong was the point
 *
 * The first measurement over 69 diagrams found exactly one unreachable node —
 * `feature-staging`'s `H_Confirm` — and it is **correct**. It flows INTO
 * `Start_Dispatch`, and its lane says why:
 *
 * > *"It precedes Start_Dispatch rather than following it, so the dispatch
 * > entry point cannot fire at all until this lane has acted."*
 *
 * A human confirmation gating an entry point. A naive reachability check would
 * have reported that deliberate modelling decision as a defect for ever, which
 * is the `ug4r` shape — a check that makes a correct choice a permanent
 * finding. So a node from which a start event is reachable is its own case and
 * passes.
 *
 * ## Both read 0 on the day they were added
 *
 * Stated rather than hidden. `gateway-branches-named` set the precedent —
 * *"it holds a line the corpus already meets rather than opening a backlog"* —
 * and that is a different thing from a check reading 0 by not looking: these
 * walk every node of every diagram, and the walk is what the sidecar records.
