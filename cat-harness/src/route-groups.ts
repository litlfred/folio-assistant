/**
 * Mount a declared set of HTTP routes, wherever they are declared.
 *
 * @module src/route-groups
 *
 * ## The defect this exists for
 *
 * `src/server.ts` named five route modules directly:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { handleFeedbackGet, handleFeedbackPost } from "./routes/feedback.js";
 * import { handleRelevanceGet, handleRelevancePost } from "./routes/relevance.js";
 * ```
 *
 * Three of those five are **content** handlers — a folio's feedback items, a
 * folio's bibliography relevance — sitting under `src/`, which the partition
 * claims for the harness by subdirectory. So they import `FeedbackItem`,
 * `TodoItem*` and `bib-verification` from core, and the harness depends on the
 * content model it is supposed to sit underneath.
 *
 * **Reclassifying them does not fix it, and this was measured rather than
 * assumed.** `bun run check:partition` on `d26a96fd`: leaving them in the
 * harness gives 10 wrong-direction edges; moving all three to core gives
 * **11**, because `src/server.ts`, `src/index.ts` and `src/routes/chat.ts`
 * then cross the line to *mount* them. Five new edges replace four. They are
 * content handlers mounted by a harness composition root, so whichever side
 * holds them, the mounting crosses.
 *
 * What removes the edge is the composition root not NAMING them. The module
 * specifier is a variable, read from the declaration — the same device as
 * `qa-checker-discovery`, `render-discovery` and `tool-groups`, and the same
 * reason it is not a loophole: `repo-partition` counts a literal
 * `import("./x")` as an edge and a variable one as none, and the edge
 * disappears exactly when the target stops being hardcoded.
 *
 * ## `ContributionRegistry` is not the mechanism here
 *
 * It looks like it should be, and it is not: `schemas/contributions.ts` is
 * read **only for dependencies** — "a root folio's own `contributes` is
 * ignored, because the root already is everything it would contribute". The
 * root's own checkers go through `qa-checker-discovery` and its own renderers
 * through `render-discovery`. Its own routes go through here, for symmetry
 * with those two rather than with the dependency path.
 *
 * ## Order is part of the declaration
 *
 * Route dispatch is first-match-wins, so {@link mountDeclaredRoutes} returns
 * routes in DECLARATION order and the server tries them in that order. This
 * is the one way a route table differs from a tool table, where registration
 * order is immaterial. Reordering the list changes behaviour; that is why the
 * order lives in one visible list instead of in the sequence of `if` blocks it
 * replaced.
 *
 * ## The deps are opaque on purpose
 *
 * {@link RouteDeps.adapter} and every entry of {@link RouteDeps.services} are
 * `unknown`. A route module casts what it needs to its own type, because the
 * layer that OWNS a type is the right place to name it — and typing them here
 * would put `ContentAdapter` and `FeedbackStore` back into the harness, which
 * is the import this module exists to remove. Same rule as
 * `schemas/contributions.ts` carrying MCP registrars as
 * `(server: unknown) => void`.
 *
 * ## Three outcomes, never two
 *
 * A declared module that is absent is **skipped and reported** — after the
 * split a harness-only checkout legitimately has no content layer and must
 * still start. A module that is present and fails to load is a different state
 * with the opposite remedy (fix it vs install that layer), so it is never
 * folded into the first. Neither is silent: a server that quietly starts
 * without its feedback routes looks identical to one where they are broken,
 * and the operator finds out from a 404 rather than from the boot log.
