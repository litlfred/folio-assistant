/**
 * Prose that says which file declares a graph, checked against the files.
 *
 * Bean `hrv2`. `AGENTS.md` told every reader that the `health` graph is
 * *"declared in `folio-assistant.config.json`"*. It is declared in
 * `cat-harness/cat-harness.json`, and the file the sentence names has no
 * `directories` key at all — it is the FOLIO config, a different family
 * entirely.
 *
 * ## Why `check:declaration-filename` could never have caught it
 *
 * That gate hunts the RETIRED name, `harness.json`, so a rename cannot leave
 * broken references behind. `AGENTS.md` does not name the retired file. It
 * names a real, current, openable file that simply does not declare that
 * graph. **A wrong name is not a retired name**, and no amount of extending
 * that check — to markdown or anywhere else — would have seen this.
 *
 * `hrv2` was opened asking whether the retired-name check should scan
 * markdown. That is a fair question with a 162-occurrence backlog behind it,
 * and it is **not this bug**. The two were conflated in the bean and are
 * separated here.
 *
 * ## The vocabulary is DERIVED, not guessed
 *
 * The first draft matched one sentence shape — `declared in X as the Y graph`
 * — and found exactly **one** claim in the corpus: the broken one. A rule
 * fitted to a single example generalises only as far as its phrasing, and the
 * next person to write such a sentence will word it differently, leaving a
 * gate that reports a clean run over a corpus of zero. That is the `dh4f`
 * shape this repository keeps paying for.
 *
 * So a claim is anchored on the GRAPH IDS the declarations actually declare
 * ({@link declaredGraphs}) rather than on wording: a `` `<id>` graph `` with a
 * `` `*.json` `` filename near it is a pairing, and the pairing either agrees
 * with the declarations or does not. Corpus went 1 → 6 on the same tree, and
 * **all six were wrong** — one wrong-but-real, five naming the retired file.
 *
 * Whitespace is flattened before matching, because the sentence that started
 * this wraps across a line break and a line-based scan was blind to the one
 * defect it would have existed for.
