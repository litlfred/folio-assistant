/**
 * Which content adapter a declared content type gets — discovered from the
 * instances that ship one, resolved at startup.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a `switch`
 *
 * `src/index.ts` is the composition root, and it read:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { PaperContentAdapter } from "../adapters/paper/index.js";
 * import { DocumentContentAdapter } from "../adapters/document/index.js";
 * // ...
 * switch (adapterType) { case "document": ... default: new PaperContentAdapter(...) }
 * ```
 *
 * The paper adapter is the science layer's — it registers Lean and LaTeX tools
 * — so the generic entry point imported it unconditionally. After the split
 * that import does not resolve in a core-only checkout, and the module fails
 * to load before any of its own error handling runs.
 *
 * ## Why it is not a TABLE either, since 2026-09-30
 *
 * The switch became a table here of `../folio-assistant-sci/adapters/paper/index.ts`
 * and `../folio-assistant-core/adapters/document/index.ts`, loaded by variable
 * path. That fixed the load failure and kept the edge: the harness still named
 * two instances built on top of it, so it could not be lifted into its own
 * repository, and — being a variable import — no static gate could see it.
 * The table's own comment said so.
 *
 * So the dependency is inverted. Each instance that ships an adapter declares
 * it in its own `<instance>.json` under `contentAdapters`
 * ({@link ContentAdapterDeclaration}), and this file reads the declarations of
 * the instances in the checkout. It names none of them. `check:import-direction`
 * is the gate that now sees the shape it replaced (bean `p11x`).
 *
 * **Where it looks is unchanged**: the checkout directory `cat-harness/` sits
 * in, one level deep — exactly where the `../<instance>/` paths resolved. The
 * `module` each entry carries is still relative to `cat-harness/`, so
 * `init-folio.ts`, which writes it into a new folio's config, needs no change.
 *
 * ## An absent adapter is reported, and the fallback is honest
 *
 * The old default was `paper` for a good reason: every folio predating the
 * document type declares `contentType: "paper"` or nothing, and the paper
 * adapter is a superset that registers the document tools too. Defaulting the
 * other way would silently drop `lean_build` from a folio whose config omits
 * `contentType`.
 *
 * That order is now DERIVED rather than positional: an adapter that `extends`
 * another sorts ahead of it, because the specialisation is the superset. And
 * when the requested type is not installed, falling back silently would hand
 * a paper folio an adapter with no `lean_build` — so the fallback is taken, and
 * SAID, naming what is not registered.
 *
