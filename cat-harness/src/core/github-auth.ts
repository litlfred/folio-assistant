/**
 * Folio Assistant — GitHub as the authenticator, and what it can and cannot
 * authorize.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-24 (issue #1207): *"need Tool fo user auth/auth"*, then *"do
 * github. do strength/weakness of github (all KG or none, no fine grain /
 * sub-graph / node-query-path control)"*. The knowledge graph's data store is a
 * git repository on GitHub, so GitHub is the one place that can say who a
 * caller is. This module asks it, and reports what it answers at the grain it
 * answers at: **one role on one whole repository**.
 *
 * ## What GitHub answers, and the grain it answers at
 *
 * - **Who**: the login behind a token (`GET /user`), or the runner-set
 *   `GITHUB_ACTOR` in a GitHub Actions job.
 * - **What they may do**: their role on the repository: `admin`,
 *   `maintain`, `write`, `triage`, `read`, or `none`. For a person's own token
 *   that is the `permissions` block of `GET /repos/{o}/{r}`; in an Actions job,
 *   where the token is the workflow's, `GET …/collaborators/{login}/permission`.
 *
 * That role covers the **entire** repository: every sub-graph, every node,
 * every path a query could take through it. GitHub has no notion of a graph, so
 * "may read the glossary but not the unpublished chapters" is not something it
 * can be asked. Anything finer is ODRL in `policies/`, decided in process for
 * callers that go through the engine — see `task-authorization.md` §"GitHub as
 * the auth layer", which is where that trade-off is argued.
 *
 * ## Mapping a GitHub role to an actor
 *
 * The role maps onto the three gateway actors that `policies/http-gateway.jsonld`
 * already grants (`owner`, `collaborator`, `viewer`), so a GitHub caller and an
 * HTTP-gateway caller get the same answer from the same policy. The mapping is
 * a property of GitHub's role names, not of any person: no login is written
 * into this repository, which is the rule `policies/` keeps.
 *
 * ## Three answers, never two
 *
 * `authenticated`, `unauthenticated` (GitHub said no, or there is no credential)
 * and `unknown` (GitHub could not be asked: network, rate limit, no repository).
 * `unknown` is never rendered as a pass.
 *
