/**
 * Tests for path containment (bean `6bhf`).
 *
 * The falsifier this file is built around is the one that matters for a
 * containment check: **a value that escapes must be refused, and a value that
 * is merely unusual must not be.** A test suite that only asserted refusals
 * would pass against `() => undefined`, which refuses everything and breaks
 * every real caller — so every refusal here has an acceptance beside it.
