/**
 * Path containment — the one place a value from outside becomes a path.
 *
 * Bean `6bhf`. This module exists because the correct answer was already in the
 * repository and stranded: `scripts/serve-rendering.ts` carried `resolveWithin`
 * and `resolveFile`, documented down to the test that caught a symlink escape,
 * while three HTTP handlers in `adapters/mcp-server/server.ts` hand-rolled
 * `join(base, externalValue)`. That is `1wef`'s shape exactly — *"somebody had
 * understood this hazard exactly. Nothing checked it, so the correctness was one
 * edit from gone."*
 *
 * ## Two functions because there are two questions
 *
 * They look similar and are not interchangeable, so collapsing them is a defect
 * rather than a tidy-up:
 *
 * | you have | you want | use |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | a **URL path** (`/a/b/c.html`), possibly percent-encoded | the file it names inside a root | `resolveWithin` / `resolveFile` |
 * | a **single identifier** (`paperId`, a slug, a bean id) | one path segment, or a refusal | `safeSegment` |
 *
 * `resolveWithin` leans on a URL pathname beginning with `/`, so `normalize`
 * absorbs leading `..` against the root. An identifier has no such leading
 * slash, and `a/b` passed to it resolves to a perfectly contained *nested* path
 * — which is wrong when the caller meant one directory. `safeSegment` refuses
 * it instead.
 *
 * ## Refuse, never repair
 *
 * Every function here returns `undefined` on a bad value rather than sanitising
 * it. Sanitising is what produced `fuzm`: the staging slug pipeline REPLACES
 * disallowed characters, so input `..` survives as output `..`, and input `---`
 * collapses to the empty string. A repair silently changes which artefact is
 * named; a refusal makes the caller decide, and the caller is the only one who
 * knows whether that is a 400, an exit 1, or a skip.

/**
 * `id` as a single safe path segment, or `undefined`.
 *
 * **The check `paperId` needed and did not have.** Measured 2026-09-25: three
 * routes in the MCP server took an external `paperId` straight into `join()`,
 * giving a write primitive outside the uploads and feedback stores.
 *
 * Refused, and each for its own reason rather than as one blanket rule:
 *
 * - **empty** — names nothing, and `join(base, "")` is `base` itself, so an
 *   empty id makes a per-item operation act on the whole store. This is the
 *   `plj1` shape one layer down: `rm -rf "pages/STAGING/$SLUG"` with an empty
 *   slug deleted every preview.
 * - **`.` and `..`** — name a directory rather than an item, and `..` escapes.
 * - **a separator** (`/` or `\`) — `a/b` is contained but is not ONE segment,
 *   and Windows accepts `\` where POSIX does not, so both are refused
 *   regardless of host.
 * - **NUL** — truncates the path for some syscalls, so what the check sees and
 *   what the kernel opens differ. No legitimate identifier carries one.
 *
 * Leading dots are otherwise allowed: `.beans.yml` and `.github` are real names
 * here, and a blanket dot ban would refuse them while catching nothing `..`
 * does not already cover.
