/**
 * Folio Assistant — access control for the HTTP routes, decided by ODRL.
 *
 * Until issue #1207 (2026-09-23) this was a three-rung ladder, viewer <
 * collaborator < owner, with every route hard-coding its own minimum rung. That
 * was a SECOND permission system beside the ODRL policies (#1180), with no
 * shared vocabulary: a route asked "collaborator or higher?" where a policy
 * asks "may this actor do `content-authoring`?". Owner: *"Replace with ODRL
 * now."*
 *
 * Now a route names the ACTION it performs and asks the same evaluator the BPMN
 * executor asks. The gateway's three sessions are three declared actors
 * (`viewer`, `collaborator`, `owner` in `.claude/skills/actors/`), and what each
 * may do is `cat-harness/policies/http-gateway.jsonld` — a policy file, where a
 * reviewer can see it, not a rung compared in code.
 *
 * Authentication is unchanged and is still the auth-gateway's: it injects
 * `X-User-Role`, `X-User-Email`, `X-User-Name`, and may inject `X-User-Actor`
 * once it maps a login to a declared actor. See
 * `skills/folio-core/deployment-auth.md` and `task-authorization.md`.
