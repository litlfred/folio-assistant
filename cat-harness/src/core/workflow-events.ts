/**
 * Which workflows OUGHT to run for a given event — read from the workflow
 * files, never from a list somebody maintains.
 *
 * @module src/core/workflow-events
 *
 * Bean `9x9r`, owner's ruling 2026-09-24 (option 1 of two). `gates.ts` derives
 * the gate set from `code-quality-gates.yml` for one reason — *"so it cannot
 * drift from what CI actually runs"* — and this is that argument applied to a
 * different question: not *which steps run*, but *which workflows are owed*.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists to fix
 *
 * `check-head-has-run` asked the Actions API for every run naming a `head_sha`
 * and decided on `runs.length > 0`. Any run. Any workflow, any event.
 *
 * That is strictly weaker than the condition it was built to detect. In this
 * repository **four** workflows declare `pull_request`, and two of those
 * (`jsonld-gen-check`, `atomic-mass-gen-check`) also declare `push` — so a
 * `push` run of a generated-file drift check satisfies `runs.length > 0` on a
 * commit whose `pull_request` event was dropped and whose gates never fired.
 * `3pqn` presenting as a ✓, from the script written to detect `3pqn`.
 *
 * Demonstrable without a stopwatch: PR #1309's head carried **two** runs of
 * `.jsonld siblings in sync with .ts manifests`, one per event.
 *
 * ## Three states, because a filtered workflow cannot be judged from a sha
 *
 * The temptation is to require every workflow declaring the event. That would
 * be wrong here and the workflow files say why:
 *
 * | workflow | `pull_request` declared as | judgeable? |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `code-quality-gates` | no filters at all | **yes — required** |
 * | `jsonld-gen-check` | `paths:` | no |
 * | `atomic-mass-gen-check` | `paths:` | no |
 * | `feature-staging` | `types:` + `paths:` | no |
 *
 * A path-filtered workflow legitimately does not run when the diff misses its
 * paths, and this module is handed a commit id rather than a diff. Calling
 * that absence a finding would make the check cry wolf on most PRs; calling it
 * a pass would assert something nothing looked at. So it is neither:
 * {@link TriggerRequirement} keeps `conditional` distinct from `required`, and
 * the caller is expected to PRINT the conditional ones rather than drop them —
 * could-not-determine is never rendered as clean.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT considered
 *
 * **Job-level `if:`.** All three of `feature-staging`'s jobs carry one, and on
 * PR #1309 two of them reported `skipped`. The *run* still existed. Since the
 * question here is whether a run happened at all, a job condition cannot
 * change the answer, and treating it as a filter would have moved a genuinely
 * required workflow into the unjudgeable column for no reason.
