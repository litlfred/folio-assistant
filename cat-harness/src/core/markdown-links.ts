/**
 * A generic markdown link auditor — parse, classify, resolve, report.
 *
 * @module src/core/markdown-links
 *
 * Bean `cp3l`. This is the half of `content/pipeline/readme-links.ts` that
 * was never about a README: given some markdown and somewhere to resolve
 * against, it says which links are dead, which resolved, and which it could
 * not check. It works on `AGENTS.md`, a skill, a workflow page or a README,
 * and it knows about none of them.
 *
 * It lived in core because its first caller did, and that cost a wrong
 * direction one layer out — a harness check auditing a harness file had to
 * reach into core to do it. `content/pipeline/readme-links.ts` keeps what is
 * genuinely README-shaped: the declared-asset lookup, the `README.md`
 * default, the config, and the CLI.
 *
 * ## What "checked" means, and the third state
 *
 * A link is only reported dead when this could actually look. A relative path
 * is resolved against the working tree; a link naming one of the repo's own
 * refs is resolved against a real `git ls-tree` of that ref; a GitHub Pages
 * URL under the configured `pagesBaseUrl` is resolved against the publish
 * ref, because that is the branch the site is served from.
 *
 * Everything else — an external host, a bare `#anchor`, a `mailto:` — is
 * **unchecked**, and so is any repo ref this checkout cannot read. Unchecked
 * is reported separately and never counted as dead: not-looked-at must not
 * read as nothing-found.

 * Every link in the file — Markdown **and HTML**.

 * Markdown: inline `[text](target)`, images `![alt](src)` (a broken image is a
 * broken link, and the one thing a reader cannot miss), and reference
 * definitions `[id]: target`.
 *
 * HTML: `<img src>` and `<a href>`. **These were invisible until 2026-09-19 and
 * that is bean `t373`.** After the site root moved to `docs/<stub>/`, eight
 * README paths were dead; this function saw five of them. The three it missed
 * were the `<img src>` BPMN diagrams at the TOP of the README — so a reader met
 * three broken images on the front page while the tool that exists to prevent
 * exactly that reported the file as having five problems, none of them those.
 *
 * Silent omission is worse than the unwired gate the same bean records, because
 * it survives wiring the gate up: the check goes green and the images stay
 * broken. A whole syntax the checker cannot see is not a `not checked` third
 * state — it is not a state at all, which is the one outcome this repository's
 * conventions never allow.
 *
 * Markdown permits raw HTML, so this is not an exotic case; it is how anybody
 * sets an image width. README carries three such links today (measured
 * 2026-09-19) and zero `<a href>`, but both are parsed — an `<a>` added later
 * must not reintroduce the hole.
