/**
 * Git facts about a repository's refs, and where this instance publishes.
 *
 * @module src/core/git-refs
 *
 * Bean `cp3l`. These four — the repo's web URL, its `owner/repo` slug, the
 * set of paths published at a ref, and the publish targets themselves — are
 * **generic git and configuration facts**. Nothing in any of them is about a
 * README, a folio, or authored content.
 *
 * They lived in `content/pipeline/readme-toc.ts` because that is where the
 * first caller was, and the cost showed up one layer out: a harness-level
 * link check over `AGENTS.md` reaching `auditLinks` reached `publishedPaths`
 * reached core, so **any** harness check that audits a link inherited a
 * wrong-direction edge, and the only ways out were to duplicate the auditor
 * or to misclassify the check. `check-agent-entry-links.ts` shipped
 * misclassified for exactly one day.
 *
 * ## `undefined` is a third state here, not a zero
 *
 * `publishedPaths` returns `undefined` for a ref it cannot read and an empty
 * set for a ref that published nothing, and the two must not collapse. A
 * shallow clone that never fetched `gh-pages` is the common case, and
 * reporting it as "published nothing" turns a clone detail into a wall of
 * false dead links.

 * at all, and every PDF cell fell back to '—'. Found against a real folio;
