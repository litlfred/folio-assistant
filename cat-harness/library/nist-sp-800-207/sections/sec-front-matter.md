Authority 
This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the 
Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq., Public Law 
(P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including 
minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply 
to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy 
authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130. 
Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and 
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these 
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, 
Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.  This publication may be used by nongovernmental 
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, 
however, be appreciated by NIST.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology 
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical 
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test 
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the 
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the 
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for 
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal 
information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and 
outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, 
government, and academic organizations. 
Abstract 
Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses 
from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. A zero trust 
architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and 
workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based 
solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based 
on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both 
subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is 
established. Zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring 
your own device (BYOD), and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterprise-
owned network boundary. Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, 
workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer 
seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. This document contains an 
abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use 
cases where zero trust could improve an enterprise’s overall information technology security 
posture.

Acknowledgments 
This document is the product of a collaboration between multiple federal agencies and is 
overseen by the Federal CIO Council. The architecture subgroup is responsible for development 
of this document, but there are specific individuals who deserve recognition. These include Greg 
Holden, project manager of the Federal CIO Council ZTA project; Alper Kerman, project 
manager for the NIST/National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence ZTA effort; and Douglas 
Montgomery.  
Audience 
This document is intended to describe zero trust for enterprise security architects. It is meant to 
aid understanding of zero trust for civilian unclassified systems and provide a road map to 
migrate and deploy zero trust security concepts to an enterprise environment. Agency 
cybersecurity managers, network administrators, and managers may also gain insight into zero 
trust and ZTA from this document. It is not intended to be a single deployment plan for ZTA as 
an enterprise will have unique business use cases and data assets that require safeguards. Starting 
with a solid understanding of the organization’s business and data will result in a strong 
approach to zero trust.
