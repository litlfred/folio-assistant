## Message Flow

The following diagrams illustrate the message flows on a single MCP endpoint.

**Requests and responses.** Each request is its own POST; the server chooses
per request whether to respond with a single JSON object or an SSE stream:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    note over Client,Server: Simple response
    Client->>Server: POST tools/call (JSON-RPC request)
    Server-->>Client: 200 OK, application/json<br/>JSON-RPC response

    note over Client,Server: Streaming response
    Client->>Server: POST tools/call (JSON-RPC request)
    note over Server: Opens SSE stream<br/>scoped to this request
    Server-->>Client: SSE: notifications/progress
    Server-->>Client: SSE: notifications/progress
    Server-->>Client: SSE: JSON-RPC response
    note over Client,Server: Stream closes

    note over Client,Server: Notification
    Client->>Server: POST (JSON-RPC notification)
    Server-->>Client: 202 Accepted
```

**Server-to-client interactions (MRTR).** When the server needs input from
the client — sampling, elicitation, or roots — it does not send its own
JSON-RPC request. It returns an
[`InputRequiredResult`][input-required-result] containing `inputRequests`,
and the client retries the original request with the matching
`inputResponses` (see [Multi Round-Trip Requests][mrtr]):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: POST tools/call (id: 1)
    note over Server: Needs user input or<br/>an LLM completion
    Server-->>Client: InputRequiredResult<br/>(inputRequests: elicitation/create)
    note over Client: Gathers the requested input
    Client->>Server: POST tools/call (id: 2)<br/>(original params + inputResponses)
    Server-->>Client: Final result
```

**Change notifications.** Clients that want server-initiated change
notifications open a long-lived stream with
[`subscriptions/listen`][subscriptions-listen]; the response stream stays
open and carries only the notification types the client opted in to:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: POST subscriptions/listen<br/>(notification filter)
    Server-->>Client: SSE: notifications/subscriptions/acknowledged
    note over Client,Server: Stream stays open
    Server-->>Client: SSE: notifications/tools/list_changed
    Server-->>Client: SSE: notifications/resources/updated
    note over Client,Server: Until the client or server closes the stream
```
