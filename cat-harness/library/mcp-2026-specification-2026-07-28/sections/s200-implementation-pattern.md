#### Implementation Pattern

When implementing external authorization via URL mode elicitation:

1. The MCP server generates an authorization URL, acting as an OAuth client to the third-party service
2. The MCP server stores internal state that associates (binds) the elicitation request with the user's identity.
3. The MCP server sends a URL mode elicitation request to the client with a URL that can start the authorization flow and an optional `requestState` that encodes information about the elicitation request and user (if needed).
4. The user completes the OAuth flow directly with the third-party authorization server
5. The third-party authorization server redirects back to the MCP server
6. The MCP server securely stores the third-party tokens, bound to the user's identity
7. Future MCP requests can leverage these stored tokens for API access to the third-party resource server

The following is a non-normative example of how this pattern could be implemented:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UserAgent as User Agent (Browser)
    participant 3AS as 3rd Party AS
    participant 3RS as 3rd Party RS
    participant Client as MCP Client
    participant Server as MCP Server

    Client->>Server: tools/call
    Note over Server: Needs 3rd-party authorization for user
    Note over Server: Store state (bind the elicitation request to the user)
    Note over Server: generate requestState that encodes information about the original request and user.
    Server->>Client: InputRequiredResult<br/>(mode: "url", url: "https://mcp.example.com/connect?...", requestState)

    Client->>User: Present consent to open URL
    User->>Client: Provide consent
    Client->>UserAgent: Open URL
    Client->>Server: Accept response
    UserAgent->>Server: Load connect route

    Note over Server: Confirm: user is logged into MCP Server or MCP AS<br>Confirm: elicitation user matches session user
    Server->>UserAgent: Redirect to third-party authorization endpoint
    UserAgent->>3AS: Load authorize route
    Note over 3AS,User: User interaction (OAuth flow):<br>User consents to scoped MCP Server access
    3AS->>UserAgent: redirect to MCP Server's redirect_uri
    UserAgent->>Server: load redirect_uri page
    Note over Server: Confirm: redirect_uri belongs to MCP Server
    Server->>3AS: Exchange authorization code for  OAuth tokens
    3AS->>Server: Grants tokens
    Note over Server: Bind tokens to MCP user identity
    Client->>Server: tools/call (ElicitResults, requestState)
    Note over Server: Retrieve token bound to user identity
    Server->>3RS: Call 3rd-party API
```

This pattern maintains clear security boundaries while enabling rich integrations with third-party services that require user authorization.
