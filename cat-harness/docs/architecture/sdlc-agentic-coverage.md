# SDLC Agentic Coverage — Mapping Folio-Assistant to the State of the Art

This architectural analysis cross-examines **folio-assistant** against the state of the art in Large Language Model-Based Multi-Agent (LMA) systems for Software Engineering, using the systematic survey by He, Treude, and Lo (arXiv:2404.04834v4, 2025; ingested at [`library/arxiv-2404.04834v4`](../../library/corpus/sdlc/arxiv-2404.04834v4/)).

Corresponding methodology node: [`research/methodologies/sdlc-agentic-landscape.md`](../../research/methodologies/sdlc-agentic-landscape.md).

## 1. Executive Summary

He, Treude, and Lo categorize multi-agent software engineering into six core lifecycle phases:
1. **Requirements Engineering**
2. **Software Design**
3. **Code Generation & Implementation**
4. **Software Quality Assurance**
5. **Software Maintenance**
6. **Software Management & End-to-End Collaboration**

Folio-assistant implements its processes as executable BPMN 2.0.2 diagrams and DMN 1.5 decision tables, in `processes/` (`content/`, `kg/`, `library/`, `process/`, `ui/`) and `sdlc/processes/`.

### Core Architectural Alignment
- **Strengths**: Folio-assistant formalizes **Requirements Engineering (CRDM suite)**, **Software Design (BPMN/DMN models and MADR ADRs)**, **Gated Quality Assurance (automated CI health, multi-voice adversarial reviews, signed QA attestations)**, and **Management Coordination (git-backed work item claims and serialized merge queue)**.
- **Identified Gaps**: As a document, guideline, and platform engineering harness, folio-assistant currently has gaps in **post-deployment runtime monitoring (live APM/log diagnosis)**, **continuous runtime telemetry feedback**, and **reverse-engineering of legacy codebases**.

## 3. Detailed Gap Checklist

### Gap 1: Post-Deployment Monitoring & Production Observability
- **The Survey Landscape**: Advanced multi-agent systems such as RCAgent (Section 3.3) perform real-time root-cause analysis in production cloud environments. Agents collect streaming logs, monitor metrics, diagnose live anomalies, and issue incident reports.
- **Folio-Assistant Gaps**: Folio-assistant monitors repository health and CI/build health (`ci-health-watch.bpmn`, `repository-health-watch.bpmn`), but has no active processes for monitoring runtime microservices, container health, or live production APIs.
- **Remediation Path**: For deployments exposing HTTP/MCP servers or live guideline portals, introduce a `sdlc/processes/runtime-telemetry-watch.bpmn` process linked to Prometheus / OpenTelemetry alerts.

### Gap 2: Continuous Runtime Telemetry Ingestion Loop
- **The Survey Landscape**: LMA systems close the loop by automatically translating production crashes and operational telemetry into actionable bug tickets, triggering automated test synthesis and candidate patches.
- **Folio-Assistant Gaps**: Folio-assistant's `beans` work-tracking graph is updated by human developers, CI gate runs, and agent sessions, but lacks automated webhooks or synthetic telemetry ingestion.
- **Remediation Path**: Define an ingest adapter that converts external incident payloads (e.g. Sentry, GitHub Security Alerts) into structured, pre-triaged `beans` with reproducible test fixtures.

### Gap 3: Legacy Software Reverse-Engineering
- **The Survey Landscape**: Modern LMA research emphasizes extracting architectural abstractions, class diagrams, and documentation from unstructured legacy codebases (100k+ lines of legacy C/Java) without tests.
- **Folio-Assistant Gaps**: Folio-assistant is optimized for greenfield and forward-engineering (generating verified documents, Lean proofs, and structured code from formal schemas and CRDM requirements). It does not maintain reverse-engineering agents to infer schemas from raw legacy repositories.
- **Remediation Path**: Implement a reverse-engineering skill in `sdlc/skills/` that parses ASTs, detects implicit business rules, and outputs candidate DMN decision tables and BPMN process skeletons.

## 4. Architectural Lessons from Empirical Case Studies

In Section 4, He et al. conduct case studies with ChatDev generating a Snake game and a Tetris game:
- **Snake Game (Moderate Complexity)**: ChatDev succeeded on the 2nd attempt in 76 seconds at $0.019 cost, producing playable code and a manual.
- **Tetris Game (High State Complexity)**: ChatDev failed across the first 9 attempts. On the 10th attempt, it produced playable blocks but **failed to implement line clearing**, a core game requirement.

### What folio-assistant does instead
Unstructured multi-agent chat is weak at complex state machines, because unconstrained role-playing agents agree on interfaces while omitting state-transition invariants. In folio-assistant, rather than relying on an agent pair to implement a rule such as line clearing correctly, state machines and business rules are captured as **DMN decision tables** (`methodologies/dmn.md`) and verified by deterministic gates or Lean 4 formalization, against edge-case witnesses.
