> written to be argued with before any code moves.

## The governing principle

**Move wiring and script together.** Every boundary this migration creates is an
opportunity to reproduce the defect `AGENTS.md` records from qou commit
`39fc90f6`: a script deleted while its hook reference survived, or a path
computed from a script's own location that was correct before a split and wrong
after.

Bean `dh4f` is the measured cost of that defect at the *last* split: 30 scripts
triaged, 23 broken, and three of them —
[including a CI gate](current-state.html#the-failure-mode-this-repo-has-already-paid-for)
— silently passing over a corpus they could no longer read. **A green check is
the symptom, not the reassurance.**

Hence every phase gate below is a *positive* assertion (this tool read this
corpus and found this) rather than a negative one (nothing went red).

## Phase 0 — unblock, before anything moves

Phase I is described in the issue as "move code around to prepare for change".
Three things have to be true first, and none of them is a move. Skipping them
means discovering in Phase II that the target shape is unreachable.

### 0.1 — Make the dependency model able to carry the split · **decided and built**

**Decision (2026-09-18, maintainer): load-time registration.**

A dependency names a module in its `<name>.config.json`:

```jsonc
{ "contributes": "./contributions.ts" }
```

Its default export is called as the root walks the dependency tree, and returns
the block kinds, adapter and MCP tools it adds. `schemas/contributions.ts` holds
the registry; `loadContributions()` in `schemas/harness-config.ts` walks and loads.

**Gate met.** A synthetic two-repo fixture in which the dependency contributes
one block kind, one adapter and one MCP tool, and the root resolves all three —
plus a test that a kind claimed by a second contributor is **refused**.
13 tests, `schemas/contributions.test.ts`.

#### What the shape costs, and what was done about it

Load-time registration was chosen over a manifest validated before loading. It
is cheaper and more familiar, and it makes **load order semantically
significant** — the same five repos in a different listed order are a different
program. Two mitigations are built in, and neither changes the chosen shape:

**Collisions do not resolve by order.** A kind claimed by two contributors
throws, naming both. Last-writer-wins would make `adapterForKind` ambiguous —
the one property `schemas/block-kinds.ts` states it must keep — *and* would make
that ambiguity depend on listing order, which is the hardest kind of bug to
reproduce from a report. A dependency also may not redefine a kind or adapter
the platform already owns: shadowing `theorem` from a config file two repos away
would change what every existing folio validates against.

**A diamond is not a collision.** The proposed graph *is* a diamond —
`smart-base → smart-kg → core` and `folio-asst-sci → core` — so a depth-first
walk reaches `core` twice. Re-registering identical content from the same
contributor is a no-op. Without that rule every realistic dependency tree throws
a false collision on first load, and the obvious fix (dropping the collision
check) is precisely the one that must not be made.

**The dependency entry's name is authoritative** over whatever the contributed
module says about itself. A contributor able to rename itself could claim
another's namespace and turn a collision into a silent merge.

**A declared-but-missing `contributes` module is a hard error**, not a silent
zero contribution — the `AGENTS.md` "move wiring and script together" failure
mode, caught at the point it occurs.

#### Where it lives, and why that mattered

`schemas/contributions.ts`, not `src/core/`. The registry is about the content
model — which kinds exist, which adapter owns them — so it belongs with the
model, and putting it under `src/` would have added another
`agentic-harness → folio-assist-core` import, already the largest
wrong-direction group. A mechanism built to enable the split must not deepen
what the split has to undo. Verified: `check:partition` reports 45 edges before
and after. MCP tool contributions are carried as opaque registrar callbacks for
the same reason, so the MCP SDK type never reaches the content model.

#### Still open under 0.1

`resolveSkillDirs` still has no caller, and there is no content-directory
resolver at all. The docstring table in `schemas/harness-config.ts` has been
corrected to say so rather than claiming both work. Wiring them is finishing
work, not a design question, and does not block Phase I.

### 0.2 — Replace the filename heuristic with a real dependency scan · **done**

`bun run check:partition` (`scripts/repo-partition.ts`) builds the import graph,
partitions it across the five proposed repos, and reports the edges crossing a
boundary in the wrong direction. Gate met: 341 modules, 670 edges, **46
wrong-direction edges** named, **0 modules unassigned** (the 27 platform
meta-scripts were triaged by hand, and are reported with their own provenance so
a judgement stays visible as a judgement). Full results in
[current state](current-state.html#the-wrong-direction-edges--phase-is-worklist).

Two results change the plan below rather than merely confirming it:

- **`smart-kg` partitions to zero modules.** There is no L1 code to move, so
  that repo is new construction like the Test repos, not an extraction. It is
  re-sequenced accordingly.
- **21 of the 46 edges are `agentic-harness` → `folio-assist-core`** — the
  harness importing the content-object model, which is its defining constraint
  failing in practice. Extracting the harness is therefore *harder* than
  extracting sci, not easier, and Phase II's order reflects that.

The count moved 33 → 41 → 45 as classification improved, and stopped only when
the unassigned column reached zero. **When re-running this, read the unassigned
column before the edge count** — a low edge count over an unclassified corpus is
the same false comfort as a green check over an empty one.

It then reached 46 when ten commits from `main` merged in: five new harness
modules, one of which imports the content model. **The harness → core violation
grows as ordinary work lands**, because nothing stops a new `src/` module
importing `schemas/types.ts`. Add `check:partition --strict` as a CI gate once
the count is driven down — the flag exists for it.

### 0.3 — Decide what `folio` is

From the [issue comment](https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/issues/223#issuecomment-5726628913):
top-level `content/` becomes `folio/`; **`folio` becomes its own schema which
can contain zero or more Content instances**; the left-hand navbar gets a
section per node in the folio instance.

The rename is mechanical and wide — **2,408 literal `content/` occurrences
across 429 files**. The schema is not mechanical and is the part that matters:
today `<name>.config.json` has a single `contentType` and a single adapter, so
"a folio" and "a content instance" are the same object. Making a folio a
container of zero-or-more instances is a model change that touches
`adapterForKind`, the profile check, the render path and the viewer.

**Do the schema first and the rename last.** A rename lands cleanly on a settled
model; a settled model does not land cleanly on a corpus mid-rename.

## Phase I — move code to the target shape, still one repo

Everything here happens **inside** `litlfred/folio-assistant`. Nothing is
extracted. The output is a repo whose directory structure is the future state,
so Phase II can be `git filter-repo` plus a `<name>.config.json` rather than
archaeology.

| # | work | gate |
|---|---|---|
| I.1 | Resolve each wrong-direction cross-edge from 0.2 — invert the dependency, move the module, or record why it is legitimate | the cross-edge list is empty or every survivor has a written reason |
| I.1b | Gate the result: `bun run check:partition --strict` in CI | a new wrong-direction edge fails the PR that introduces it, rather than being found at extraction time |
| I.2 | Introduce the `folio` schema (0.3); a folio holds 0..n content instances | `content_validate` passes on a zero-instance folio **and** a two-instance folio |
| I.3 | Rename `content/` → `folio/` | no `content/` path literal survives outside intentional content-instance paths; full test suite green **and** a synthetic-folio run proves each moved tool still reads its corpus |
| I.4 | LHS navbar renders a section per node in the folio instance | a two-instance folio shows two sections; a zero-instance folio renders without error |
| I.5 | Group modules into the five target trees | each tree builds with only its declared dependencies on the path |
| I.6 | Split QA **infrastructure** (harness) from QA **criteria** (downstream) | the criterion registry loads zero criteria without erroring; criteria come from a dependency |
| I.7 | Reconcile the three `todo-manager.md` copies (`AGENTS.md` records a 188-line divergence and one copy with **no CI guard**) | one canonical copy; every other is generated and checked |
| I.8 | **Every repo declares `stub` + `canonicalUrl` and publishes `<stub>.jsonld` / `<stub>.schema.json`** | `bun run kg:export` in each repo emits artefacts named after that repo, with absolute `@id`s under its own `canonicalUrl` |

**I.8 is what keeps five repos from becoming five vocabularies.** Each split
repo publishes its own knowledge graph, and the graphs are only mergeable if
their node IRIs do not collide. Naming every artefact after its repository and
minting `@id`s under that repository's `canonicalUrl` guarantees that by
construction: `agentic-harness.jsonld` and `folio-assist-core.jsonld` cannot
assert the same node IRI, because the document IRI is part of every node's.

The corollary is the rule the skill states and a test enforces: **artefacts are
stub-named, the declaration file is not.** The first half still holds; the
second was re-decided on 2026-09-21, and the declaration is now `<name>.json`
— named for the instance's `name` rather than its `stub`, which is what keeps
it out of the stub-named set.

The concern recorded here was **discovery**, and it was real: a consumer must
be able to open a repository it has never seen without first knowing what it
is called. It was answered rather than dropped. The failure this paragraph
warned of — *a resolver computing the filename from the directory finds
nothing when a repo is cloned under a different name, and reports "no config"
rather than an error* — is the failure `findDeclarationFile()` is built to
avoid: it never computes the name from the directory, but scans for a `*.json`
whose stem equals the `name` **inside** it, and throws when a directory holds
two rather than picking one.
See [`directory-conventions`](../../skills/folio-core/directory-conventions.md)
§Naming and [`kg-export`](../../skills/folio-core/kg-export.md).

**I.3 is the one to stage carefully.** 2,408 occurrences is a scale at which a
single sweep is unreviewable. Split it by consumer — pipeline, scripts, docs,
workflows, CI — with the wiring for each moving in the same commit as its
targets.

## Phase II — separate repos, incrementally

One repo at a time, each becoming a folio-assistant instance in its own right.

**Order, cheapest-first, each proving something the next needs:**

| order | repo | proves | why here |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `folio-asst-sci` | a dependency can contribute schemas, an adapter and MCP tools | hardest mechanism, cleanest boundary — 101 files that already cluster |
| 2 | `agentic-harness` | the harness genuinely does nothing on its own | extracting it *from underneath* core is how you find out what core assumed |
| 3 | `smart-base` | a dependency-of-a-dependency resolves | the depth-first walk is exercised for real |
| 4 | `smart-kg` | the L1/L2 line holds | needs WHO context; least-built today |
| 5 | `smart-kg-tools`, `smart-base-tools` | the Tool/Content kind split | only worth doing once the parents are stable |

`folio-assist-core` is never extracted: it is what remains.

**Per-repo gate — all five required:**

1. `git filter-repo` preserves history for every moved file.
2. The extracted repo builds and tests **standalone**, with its declared
   dependencies and nothing else on the path.
3. The parent, with the extraction declared as a dependency, is green.
4. **Every moved tool is run against a synthetic folio and asserted to have read
   a non-empty corpus** — the `dh4f` gate. An empty corpus exits non-zero.
5. No wiring left behind: every hook, workflow and doc reference to a moved
   script is repointed in the *same* change.

**Rollback:** until gate 3 passes, the extracted repo is additive — the parent
keeps its copy. The cutover commit is the one that deletes the parent's copy,
and it is the only commit in Phase II worth reverting as a unit.

## Phase III — build on the harness

New construction, not migration. L4/L5 Content, Tool and Test repos built off
`agentic-harness`, and healthworker- and individual-facing workflows
(immunizations is the issue's example).

The Test repos are the substantive new thing, because
[no Test repo exists today](current-state.html#what-this-repo-is-authoritative-for-today):
test data, generation templates, FHIR Test Plans, Gherkin dialects, ITB
configuration. Their defining requirement is the taxonomy's — **test data assets
are themselves folio content types in the KG** — so that SME review of test data
is the same workflow, with the same QA sidecars and the same translation path,
as review of anything else.

**Phase III is the test of whether the split worked.** If a
healthworker-facing folio has to depend on `folio-asst-sci` to get a working
install, the boundary is in the wrong place and Phase II is not finished.

## Risks

| risk | why it bites here | mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Silent-success scripts** | proven at the last split: 30 scripts, 23 broken, a CI gate passing over 0 blocks | every gate is a positive assertion over a synthetic folio |
| **The dependency model cannot carry it** | schemas and MCP tools are ruled out by design *today* | Phase 0.1 is a hard blocker, sequenced before any move |
| **The rename swamps review** | 2,408 occurrences across 429 files | staged by consumer; schema before rename |
| **Folio specifics leak into a split repo** | already the most-repeated defect in `AGENTS.md` | `platform-boundary-guard` subagent on every extraction; a TRAP entry per incident |
| **Boundaries drawn without domain context** | the L1/L2 line needs WHO knowledge this repo does not encode | `smart-kg` sequenced 4th; the line is drawn by a person, not inferred |
| **Five changelogs, one change** | a cross-cutting fix now needs five PRs | the ordering test: split only where consumers or cadences differ |

## What this plan does not decide

Stated plainly so the gaps are not mistaken for omissions:

- **Whether a dependency may contribute adapters and MCP tools** (0.1). The
  largest open question; `folio-asst-sci` is unbuildable until it is answered.
- **Where the L1/L2 boundary falls** between `smart-kg` and `smart-base`.
- **Whether the viewer splits by content type** or exposes a registration point
  ([future state](future-state.html#folio-assist-core)).
- **Repo ownership, naming and hosting** — org, visibility, release cadence.
- **Whether `folio-asst-sci` depends on core only**, as the issue states, or
  also needs harness surface that core does not re-export.
