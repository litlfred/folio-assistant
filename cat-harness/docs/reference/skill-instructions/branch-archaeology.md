# Branch archaeology: what each branch holds that main does not

The question sounds like `git branch -r --no-merged`, and that command answers
it wrong. It tests **ancestry**, so a branch landed by **squash** or
**cherry-pick** (which is how most PRs land here) shows as unmerged forever.
`lsi:epics` uses it to find unmerged branches, which is fine for filing and
wrong for disposal.

**Measured in the `qou` folio, 2026-10-04 (issue #2106, bean `nrrf`):** 6,480
remote branches, of which **461 held mathematics not on main**. Those 461 are
the reason for the rule in §2. A sweep that labelled them "stale" would have
offered the only copy of proofs for deletion.

## 1. The five classes, decided in this order

| class | test | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `merged` | `git merge-base --is-ancestor <tip> origin/main` | every commit is on main |
| `landed` | `git merge-tree --write-tree origin/main <tip>` produces **main's own tree**, or every commit's patch-id is on main (`git cherry origin/main <tip>` prints only `-`), or the branch's **combined** diff patch-id matches a main commit (the squash case) | the CHANGE is on main under other commits |
| `partial` | some commits' patch-ids are on main, some are not | part landed; the rest is unique work |
| `unlanded` | none of the above, and every test ran | unique work |
| `undetermined` | a test could not run: an object could not be fetched, or merge-tree conflicted and patch-ids disagree | **not** `unlanded` and **not** `landed`. Report it as unknown |

Some notes on the tests:

- **The merge-tree test is the strongest.** If merging the branch into main
  changes nothing, then nothing on the branch is missing from main, however it
  got there: squash, cherry-pick, a re-implementation with the same result, or
  a revert-and-reapply. A **conflict** proves nothing either way, so move on to
  the patch-id tests.
- **`git cherry` compares per-commit patch-ids.** It catches cherry-picks. It
  misses a squash, because one squashed commit's patch-id equals the sum of the
  branch, not any single commit. Hence the combined test:

  ```sh
  base=$(git merge-base origin/main "$tip")
  git diff "$base" "$tip" | git patch-id --stable          # the branch as one patch
  git log --format=%H "$base"..origin/main | while read c; do
    git show "$c" | git patch-id --stable                  # each main commit since
  done
  ```

- **Subject lines are never evidence.** Two commits titled "fix build" share
  nothing, and a squash usually renames.
- **`undetermined` must never be folded into either neighbour.** A census that
  counts it as unlanded inflates salvage work. One that counts it as landed
  offers unique work for deletion, which is the `dh4f` shape: a clean report
  over what the tool could not read.

Two flags sit beside the class rather than inside it:

- **`open-pr: #n`** — any branch backing an open PR is live, whatever its class.
- **`beans: […]`** — bean ids named in its commit messages, the same
  extraction `lsi:epics` performs. This is the link that lets
  [`work-plan-restructure`](work-plan-restructure.md) close a bean whose work
  this census shows `landed`.

## 2. Content protection: a content branch is salvage-review, never delete-candidate

**If an unlanded or partial branch touches content, it goes on the
salvage-review list and is never offered for deletion, at any age or size.**
"Content" means any path under a directory the instance declares with a
content kind (`folio`, `library`), any `.lean` file, and the folio's block,
chapter and computation sources. Read the declaration
(`<instance>.json`); do not use a hard-coded path list.

The reason is asymmetric cost. A platform branch's unique work can usually be
re-derived from the issue that motivated it. A proof, a computation or an
authored chapter often cannot, because the session that wrote it is gone and
its scrollback with it. So:

| branch | goes to |
|---|---|
| `merged` / `landed`, no open PR | **delete-candidate** list, with size, age, last author and the evidence that it landed |
| `partial` / `unlanded`, no content touched | **review** list, with unique commits, size and age |
| `partial` / `unlanded`, content touched | **salvage-review** list, with the unique paths and hunks, and bean ids |
| `undetermined` | **unknown** list, with the test that failed |
| any class with an open PR | not listed for disposal at all |

**The delete-candidate list is a report, not an action.**
[`deletion-requires-confirmation`](deletion-requires-confirmation.md):
the owner reads it, with sizes and ages, and says which go. A branch is the
last copy of its commits once the PR is closed, and `plj1` is that skill's
worked example of a workflow whose shape deleted work nobody decided to delete.

### The content census — "absent on main" is the signal, "differs" is not

For a branch on the salvage list, the question is which of its content is
**nowhere on main**. Compare at three levels, strongest first:

1. **By name, not by path.** For each Lean module and declaration, and each
   block label, the branch adds, search main for the **name** anywhere. A
   module that moved directories is still on main. **Measured in the `qou`
   orphaned-content census, 2026-10-04:** of 60 recent unlanded branches, 32
   touched content and 27 carried content not on main. After excluding schema
   files, the residue was **12 Lean modules on 7 branches** whose names occur
   nowhere on main. That residue is the salvage list. The other 55 files that
   merely "differ" are not.
2. **Path-remapped.** A branch cut before a layout move uses the old paths
   (qou's branches all predate its `content/` → `folio/` move). Remap through
   the move before comparing, or every file reads as absent. Take the remap
   from the commit that made the move. Do not guess it.
3. **"Differs from main" is not unique work.** Main moved on after the branch
   was cut. Count it separately, and never as math. Only a three-way
   comparison against the merge-base says whose change a hunk is.

**Salvage is filed per CLUSTER, not per branch.** 461 branches are not 461
beans. Beans are not sidecars, and one bean per branch is the generated-template
flood [`work-plan-restructure`](work-plan-restructure.md) exists to clean up.
Group the salvage list by the subject its unique paths touch (a chapter, a Lean
namespace), and propose one bean per group to the owner.

## 3. Making 6,000 branches cheap: a treeless fetch

```sh
git fetch --filter=tree:0 origin '+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*'
```

This fetches every head's **commits** without their trees or blobs: **15 s for
~6.5k branches** in qou. That is enough for the ancestry test and for the
commit-message bean extraction. The merge-tree and patch-id tests need trees
and blobs, which the partial clone then fetches **on demand**, per branch. So
order the work to fetch as little as possible:

1. Ancestry for every branch (commits only, cheap). Most stale branches end
   here as `merged`.
2. Open-PR heads from the API, once.
3. Merge-tree, then patch-id, only for what is left. A branch whose objects
   cannot be fetched is `undetermined` (§1), not skipped silently.

## 4. Cache by tip sha, and know which classes go stale

Key each row by **branch tip sha** and record the **main sha** it was computed
against.

- `merged` and `landed` are **monotone**: main only grows, so they stay true
  while the tip is unchanged. The exception is a revert on main, which the
  next full run catches.
- `partial`, `unlanded` and `undetermined` **must be recomputed when main
  moves**, because the work may have landed since.
- A changed tip invalidates the row whatever its class.

A re-run then costs only the branches that moved plus the non-monotone rows.
The full answer is never re-derived from scratch, which is the waste
[`goal-review`](goal-review.md) and the survey graph (`beans/surveys/`)
already exist to stop.

## 5. The report

For each branch: name, tip sha, main sha, class, the evidence (which test
decided it, patch-ids matched of total), `open-pr`, `beans`, commits ahead,
size of the unique diff, last commit date, and the last author or
`Claude-Session:` trailer. Then the four lists in §2, each with counts, and
the `undetermined` count stated beside the others, never dropped.

Where it goes: summarised on the issue or in a bean note
(`bun run beans:note`) for the owner, and the per-branch rows as a file
attached to that review. A committed, declared home for a recurring census
(a `qa-reports` sidecar) is not built yet. Do not invent an undeclared
directory for it. Name the gap instead.

## What this skill does not do

- **Delete, prune or close anything.** Not branches, not PRs, not beans.
- **Judge whether unique work is wanted.** `unlanded` means "not on main", not
  "should be on main". That call belongs to the owner, through salvage review.
- **Replace [`branch-freshness`](branch-freshness.md)**
  (your own branch against main) or [`coordinate`](coordinate.md) (live sibling
  PRs). This skill is the census of everything else.
