# Checklist — Human Translation Workflow

> **Generated, and not the authority.** This is `cat-harness/processes/library/human-translation-workflow.bpmn` (process `Process_HumanTranslation`) walked as a state machine. The diagram and the workflow engine decide; this list only reads them. Follow the `next:` line of each step rather than the order on the page, and record each step with the call it names, so the engine's committed state — not this list — says which edge was taken.

The human half of translation: a coordinator assigns a locale to a qualified translator, the translator works in their own tool, a subject-matter expert judges accuracy, and only then is the result official.

## Begin — Translation needed for content node(s) (`Start_TranslationNeeded`)

- Begin here: A translation coordinator identifies one or more content nodes that require human translation into a target locale.
- Call `workflow_start` with `process: "Process_HumanTranslation"` and the subject this run is about; keep the instance id it returns.
- next: → `Task_IdentifyContent` (Identify content and target locale)

### 1. Identify content and target locale (`Task_IdentifyContent`)

- Who: the `Translation Coordinator` lane (role `translation-coordinator`).
- Skill: `translation-manager`.
- What: The coordinator selects: - Which content nodes need translation (block, section, chapter, or folio) - The target locale (one of the supportedLocales in <name>.config.json) - The priority and deadline
- Record it: `workflow_complete` with `node: "Task_IdentifyContent"`.
- next: → `Task_ExtractPOT` (Extract the POT)

### 2. Extract the POT (`Task_ExtractPOT`)

- Who: the `Automated Pipeline` lane (role `build-pipeline`).
- Skill: `translation-manager`.
- What: Scan the source content and write the translatable strings to .pot files at the configured granularity: segment prose by paragraph, shield what must not be translated (math, code, labels, Lean companions) as placeholders, normalise whitespace, and extract metadata such as titles, alt text and captio
- Shared step `GT_ExtractPot`.
- Record it: `workflow_complete` with `node: "Task_ExtractPOT"`.
- next: → `Task_PrepareGlossary` (Prepare domain glossary)

### 3. Prepare domain glossary (`Task_PrepareGlossary`)

- Who: the `Automated Pipeline` lane (role `build-pipeline`).

### 4. Assign to qualified human translator (`Task_AssignTranslator`)

### 7. Submit completed .po file (`Task_SubmitPO`)

- Who: the `Human Translator` lane (role `translator`).
- Skill: `translation-manager`, `translation-manager`, `translation-manager`.
- What: The translator submits the completed .po file back to the pipeline.

- next: → `Task_CheckCompleteness` (Check translation completeness)

### 8. Check translation completeness (`Task_CheckCompleteness`)

- Who: the `Translation Coordinator` lane (role `translation-coordinator`).
- Skill: `translation-manager`.
- What: Verify that all msgid entries have msgstr translations.
- Record it: `workflow_complete` with `node: "Task_CheckCompleteness"`.
- next: → `Gateway_Complete` (Complete enough?)

### Decide — Complete enough? (`Gateway_Complete`)

- Answered by the completeness check on the submitted PO file: are enough strings translated?
- Call `workflow_complete` with `node: "Gateway_Complete"` and `outcome` set to the label that holds:
  - «Incomplete» → `Task_RequestMoreWork` (Request completion of remaining strings)
  - «Complete» → `Task_InjectPO` (Inject the PO)

### 9. Request completion of remaining strings (`Task_RequestMoreWork`)

- Who: the `Translation Coordinator` lane (role `translation-coordinator`).

### 10. Inject the PO (`Task_InjectPO`)

- Who: the `Automated Pipeline` lane (role `build-pipeline`).
- Skill: `translation-manager`.
- What: Read the .po file and the source .md, substitute msgstr for msgid, unshield the placeholders, and write the translated .md to translations/<locale>/.
- Shared step `GT_InjectPo`.

## Done — Translation is official (`End_OfficialTranslation`)

- The instance completes here. `workflow_next` then reports nothing enabled — that, not this line, is the record of completion.
