 *
 * ## Relationship to FHIR R5
 *
 * The `Requirement` type mirrors the
 * [FHIR R5 Requirements](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/requirements.html)
 * resource model: each requirement contains statements with conformance
 * verbs (SHALL/SHOULD/MAY). FHIR's `satisfiedBy` is the inverse of the
 * `satisfies` a skill or capability declares, and is derived from it. This enables
 * cross-repository interoperability with WHO SMART Guidelines (smart-base).

/**
 * What kind of participant the actor is — **human, agentic or mechanical**.
 *
 * - `person` — **human**. An identity a real person holds (git config, OAuth).
 * - `agent` — **agentic**. An LLM agent: it can be handed a skill to read and
 *   asked for a judgement.
 * - `system` — **mechanical**. A fixed program — an MCP server, a CI runner. It
 *   executes a procedure and decides nothing.
 * - `external` — a participant outside this instance entirely.
 *
 * Re-exported from `schemas/skill-package.ts`, which holds the one vocabulary,
 * so this file does not become a second place the values can be edited.
 *
 * It read `"person" | "system"` until 2026-09-19, and that two-way split is
 * what made *"which tasks can this actor perform"* unanswerable: the question
 * turns on whether the participant exercises judgement, and an LLM agent and a
 * CI runner wore the same label.

/**
 * A reference from a skill to a required capability, with a
 * degradation strategy when the capability is unavailable.
 *
 * | Strategy | Behavior |
 * |----------|----------|
 * | `fail` | Skill cannot execute — abort with error |
 * | `warn` | Log a warning but continue |
 * | `skip` | Silently skip this skill |
 * | `fallback` | Use the capability's `fallbackTo`, or a derived human lane |
 *
 * ## A fallback may be another ACTOR, not only another tool — and it is DERIVED
 *
 * Until 2026-09-20 the only fallback was `fallbackCapabilityId` — always
 * another capability. So the model could express *use a different tool* and
 * could not express *use a different kind of participant*, and the case the
 * owner raised was unrepresentable:
 *
 * > "some of the machine actors may be air-gapped, it is a property of an
 * > actor. depending on the propeorty, different tools might not work. in
 * > this case an API wouldnt wokr and a human actor is needed."
 *
 * When no tool can do it, the answer is a **person**. A `fallbackRole` field
 * was added that day to say so, and **removed the same day** — bean
 * `folio-assistant-85e8`, on the owner's question: *"do we need fallbackRole,
 * can it be computed, i dont like duplicate data maintenace issues"*.
 *
 * **It can, exactly.** The diagram already carries it, executably:
 * `Gateway_SigningRoute` branches to `Task_HumanSign`, a `userTask`, in
 * `Lane_Human`, which binds `<folio:role ref="publication-manager"/>`. So
 * the fallback role is *the role of a lane holding a task only a person can
 * fill* — `fulfilmentKindsForBpmnType`, which the diagram's own
 * documentation already relies on to stop the air-gapped route quietly
 * becoming another machine route.
 *
 * Measured before removing it: the derivation returns exactly the declared
 * value, and is unambiguous across the corpus — 3 of 3 skills with any
 * human-only lane have exactly one such role. `fallbackRoleFor` in
 * `scripts/check-fallback-roles.ts` is the query.
 *
 * **Why the declaration had to go rather than be checked.** It was one fact
 * in two places with nothing asserting they agreed, which is the drift this
 * repository keeps paying for. The argument for keeping it — declaration and
 * execution are different mechanisms — is real, and it is not enough: a
 * declaration that can be computed from the executable artefact is a cached
 * copy, and an unvalidated cache is worse than no cache.
 *
 * **Why not model "a human is available" as a capability**, which would have
 * reused the existing field: a `CapabilityDefinition` carries
 * `detection: { method: "command", … }` — a thing you PROBE the environment
 * for. A person is not probeable by a command, and bean
 * `folio-assistant-ind9` fixed exactly the error of putting non-probeable
 * things in `capabilities[]`. Reusing it would undo a completed fix.
 *
 * **What reads `degradation`, honestly. Nothing does.** Measured 2026-09-20:
 * 24 skill modules declare `requiredCapabilities` with 24 degradation values
 * (17 `fail`, 6 `fallback`, 1 `warn`). An earlier revision of this comment
 * said the only reader was `scripts/generate-docs.ts`, "which RENDERS them" —
 * too generous, and the more comfortable error, because a field with one
 * renderer sounds maintained while a field with none is inert. That script
 * was never invoked by anything, in any commit since the root commit, and
 * was RETIRED to `fsh-guts/scripts/` (bean `folio-assistant-3w0i`). So the
 * count of readers is ZERO.
 *
 * `degradation` is NOT duplicate data and was kept: `fail` says a skill
 * cannot run without the capability, which no diagram states. It needs a
 * reader, not a deletion.

  // NO `fallbackRole`. It existed for eight hours on 2026-09-20 and was

 * cross-reference skills with their data models"*. The generator that would
 * have done the cross-referencing was `scripts/generate-docs.ts`, which had
 * been in this repository since its ROOT COMMIT and **never ran once** —

 * never committed. It was retired to `fsh-guts/scripts/` (bean
 * `folio-assistant-3w0i`), and with it went the only code that referenced
 * this type.
 *
 * So 11 of 22 skill modules carried a declaration that reached no reader and
 * no page. The declarations are removed (`folio-assistant-t2yg`); the type
 * stays because a downstream instance may hold one and a removed export is a
 * breaking change for a field that costs nothing to leave declarable.
