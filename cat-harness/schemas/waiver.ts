/**
 * A confirmation the owner has given **in advance**, scoped and dated.
 *
 * Skill: [`confirmation-waiver`](../skills/folio-core/confirmation-waiver.md).
 * Owner, 2026-09-20: *"human can waive confirmation rights (e.g. for session,
 * for process run)"*, and *"context dependent, should be in memories"*.
 *
 * ## Why a kind of its own rather than a memory label
 *
 * A waiver is `context` by exactly the test that made `memory` one — a running
 * process READS it and no step writes it; it changes when a person acts,
 * outside any instance. That is why it is declared over the same directory.
 *
 * It is nevertheless a separate kind, because {@link MemoryNodeSchema} carries
 * **no status by design** — `schemas/memory.ts` says so in as many words: *"a
 * TRAP is not 'open', and marking one 'done' would assert that the failure it
 * records has stopped being possible."* A waiver's entire content is that it
 * expires. Filing one as a memory entry labelled `stable` would assert the
 * opposite of what the node says.
 *
 * ## Every field is required, and the reason is the same one each time
 *
 * A waiver exists to move a decision from the agent to the person. Each field
 * below is a way that move can be faked, closed off:
 *
 * - no `grantedBy` → an agent's own decision wearing a hat;
 * - no `quote` → the agent's paraphrase, which can widen a scope silently;
 * - no `gate` → a blanket permission nobody can audit;
 * - no `scope` → a grant that outlives the situation that justified it;
 * - no `expires` → **indistinguishable from one nobody remembered to
 *   withdraw**, which is the argument `bean-blocking.md` makes for a block and
 *   it transfers without modification.
 *
 * So the schema has no `.optional()` anywhere, and a malformed waiver is not a
 * lenient waiver — it is **no waiver**, and the gate it named still stands.
 *

/**
 * The gates a waiver may relax.
 *
 * **This list is the vocabulary, and it is closed on purpose.** The skill
 * publishes the same table with the rule each row relaxes; a gate class that
 * is not here cannot be waived, which is what stops the vocabulary drifting
 * into "everything".
 *
 * What is deliberately ABSENT is as load-bearing as what is present: bean
 * deletion, and any rule whose text is *never*. A waiver relaxes a rule that
 * says **ask first**. A prohibition is not a confirmation the owner is owed,
 * so there is nothing there to give back — and for bean deletion the
 * non-destructive move (`scrapped`, with reasons) is always available.
