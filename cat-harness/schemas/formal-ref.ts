/**
 * Dependency injection point for FORMAL REFERENCES — the `lean:` field's
 * grammar and the package list it resolves against.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * 🟧 **Owner ruling, 2026-09-27**, verbatim across two messages:
 *
 * > *"f-a-sci __should__ have scehams for math/science papers."*
 * > *"field sits on shared kinds (remark, example, algorithm, simulator), so
 * > the grammar genuinely is  vocabulary that goes tp f-a-sci"*
 *
 * `schemas/lean-packages.ts` argued the other way in its own docstring —
 * *"the field is on shared block kinds by design … So the grammar belongs
 * wherever the field does"*, i.e. core — and `scripts/partition/instance-rules.ts`
 * applied that test **five times** to keep five modules in core. The ruling
 * rejects it at the premise: a `lean` field appearing on a shared kind does not
 * make the grammar core, it makes *that field on those kinds* part of the
 * science vocabulary.
 *
 * Reassigning `lean-packages.ts` and `lean-signature.ts` to `sci` without this
 * module yields **six** measured `core → sci` wrong-direction edges:
 *
 * ```
 * schemas/constraints.ts        -> schemas/lean-packages.ts
 * adapters/mcp-server/server.ts -> schemas/lean-packages.ts
 * adapters/document/resolver.ts -> schemas/lean-packages.ts
 * adapters/manifest-entries.ts  -> schemas/lean-packages.ts
 * content/pipeline/qa-utils.ts  -> schemas/lean-packages.ts
 * content/pipeline/qa-utils.ts  -> content/pipeline/lean-signature.ts
 * ```
 *
 * This is the injection that removes them.
 *
 * ## What core actually needed, which is NOT the grammar
 *
 * Read at the five call sites rather than at the imports, every one of them
 * does the same three steps: `parseLeanRef(ref)`, `leanPackageByName(pkg)`,
 * then build source paths from the package's `lakeRoot` and the parsed
 * `module` / `decl` / `name`. **Core never wants the grammar — it wants
 * candidate source paths**, which it then tries with its own file access
 * (`ctx.fileExists`, `readFileBranch`, `existsSync`, a `grep`).
 *
 * So {@link FormalRefResolution} is a *resolution record*, and the grammar,
 * the package registry and the path convention all stay behind it in the layer
 * that owns them. Core gains no new vocabulary: it does not learn what a Lake
 * root is, what a module path is, or that the separator is a dot.
 *
 * ## Third instance of an established pattern, deliberately
 *
 * `content/pipeline/references-registry-di.ts` (the bibliography) and
 * `value-registry-di.ts` (the values registry) are the same shape, and this
 * module copies it down to the names: a `configure…`, a `…Configured()`
 * predicate, and a getter that returns `undefined` rather than throwing.
 *
 * The `configured` predicate is not decoration, and the bibliography DI's own
 * docstring states the argument: *"a caller that can legitimately proceed
 * without references needs to ASK rather than catch … Without this predicate
 * the validator could not tell 'this folio has no bibliography' from 'the
 * citation check did not run', and reported the same clean result either way."*
 *
 * **That is the live latent defect this fixes, recorded as qou bean
 * `qou-i2ed`.** `lean-packages.ts` has exactly such a predicate,
 * `leanPackagesConfigured()`, and it has **zero callers anywhere** —
 * measured — so `leanPackageByName()` returns `undefined` at all eight
 * production sites in every real run and two load-bearing checks fail in
 * OPPOSITE directions: `definition-lean-exists` fails closed (a false
 * "requires Lean formalization"), the §3b-cond propagation audit fails open
 * (a false "not class-axiomatised"). It bites nothing today only because
 * every block with a `lean.ref` also has a sibling `.lean`, which is itself a
 * deviation from qou AGENTS.md §0a. Draining those stubs would make it live.
 *
 * Every consumer here is therefore written to distinguish the two states, and
 * to say "not checked" rather than silently taking the `undefined` branch.
 *
 * @module schemas/formal-ref
 * @graphNode schema
