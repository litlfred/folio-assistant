/**
 * When a card stops rendering its words and becomes its avatar.
 *
 * @module schemas/semantic-zoom
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## The requirement, and the question it does not answer
 *
 * R2 of issue #602: *"As the board shrinks, a card SHALL stop rendering its
 * words and render its avatar instead. The threshold SHALL be declared data,
 * not a literal in the renderer."*
 *
 * That says the number must be declared. It does not say **whose** number it
 * is, and the answer is not obvious: `data-modelling`'s disappearance test —
 * *would this fact still be true if the entity went away?* — cuts both ways.
 * The number survives any one board and any one kind, which argues for the
 * folio; but *"when does **this** become unreadable"* is plainly a fact about
 * the thing being read.
 *
 * ## The owner's ruling, 2026-09-20 (CRDM Q4)
 *
 * > **Folio default, a kind may override.**
 *
 * Which is this repository's own inheritance rule applied unchanged: *inherit
 * everything, override anything; a variant states only what it CHANGES.* So
 * the folio always has a number, every kind resolves to one, and a kind that
 * states nothing is **complete rather than invalid** — requiredness is checked
 * after resolution, never on the declaration.
 *
 * ## An override CITES WHY, and the resolver says where the number came from
 *
 * `because` is required on an override, and {@link zoomThresholdFor} returns
 * the `source` alongside the value. Both exist for the same reason, which
 * `data-modelling` states outright: *an inherited value is still a fact
 * somebody must be able to trace.* A resolver that returned a bare number
 * would record what the value is and lose where it came from — and a reviewer
 * looking at a card that flipped too early could not tell a deliberate
 * override from the default landing somewhere it does not fit.
 *
 * **It is not an entity.** ZoomThreshold has no identifier of its own and
 * cannot exist apart from the folio or the kind that states it, which is the
 * test that also demoted `NoteAnchor` and `Avatar` to attributes.
 *
 * ## PIXELS, and why the unit is not board units
 *
 * `board-positions.ts` stores positions in board units precisely so a file
 * does not bake in the viewport it was written on. This is the opposite kind
 * of fact: legibility is a property of what reaches the reader's eye, so the
 * threshold is the card's RENDERED width in CSS pixels, after zoom. A card at
 * 40 board units is legible or not depending on the scale, and the scale is
 * what the reader is changing.

/**
 * The folio's declaration, or `undefined` when it has not made one.
 *
 * ## Where the file lives, and why it took a bean to decide
 *
 * At the **root of the instance that owns the folio**, beside its
 * `<name>.config.json` — because the threshold is a fact about the FOLIO, and
 * that is where a folio's own declarations sit. (It said `harness.json` until
 * #649 renamed every declaration to carry its instance's name; the rule is
 * unchanged, the filename is not composable any more.) Not the instantiation root: that is
 * where `<name>.config.json` says an instance is instantiated HERE, which is a
 * different question from what one of them declares about its content.
 *
 * The other two candidates were wrong for reasons worth keeping. A board
 * cannot own it, because the threshold survives deleting every board and
 * `board-diagram-interchange`'s test says a fact that survives the layout is
 * not layout. And a new graph KIND would have been a directory, a declaration
 * entry and a consumer contract for one object with no identifier of its
 * own.
 *
 * ## `undefined` is a real answer and is never a number
 *
 * The schema gives `belowPx` no default *"so nothing is ever unstated"*, and
 * this function keeps that promise at the file boundary: a folio that has not
 * declared a threshold gets `undefined`, and every consumer must then say it
 * could not determine one rather than reaching for a literal. That is the
 * whole of R2 — *"the threshold SHALL be declared data, not a literal in the
 * renderer"* — and a fallback here would have put the literal one layer down
 * where nobody would look for it.
 *
 * A present-but-unparseable file **throws**, on the rule this repository
 * applies to every declaration: absent is a decision, malformed is a defect,
 * and treating the second as the first hides it.
