/**
 * dependency-order.ts — flatten a dependency hierarchy into ONE ordered list,
 * with the failure policy attached to each step rather than to the runner.
 *
 * ## Why this is a module and not four hand-written orderings
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20, asking for the README render to be placed in the
 * rendering pipeline:
 *
 * > dynamic parts (kg vierwe, visaluzers, etc) render in flattened depndency
 * > order, failures = skip/log/qa or so
 *
 * and immediately after, generalising it:
 *
 * > readme epid need to flattening of depndency hieracy, rulles + tools. as do
 * > other skills. this is a repeable subprocess
 *
 * **A repeatable subprocess is a thing with one implementation.** Four callers
 * wanting "run these in dependency order" is four topological sorts, three of
 * which are subtly different and none of which is tested. The orderings this
 * repository already needs are the render pipeline, the instances table, the
 * work-plan roadmap and the skill graph — and they differ only in what the
 * nodes are, never in what ordering MEANS.
 *
 * ## The four rules, and each one is a decision rather than a default
 *
 * 1. **A node runs after everything it declares `needs`.** Nothing else
 *    implies order. A node that needs nothing is free to run first.
 * 2. **Ties break on declaration order, not on id.** Sorting ties
 *    alphabetically makes the flattened list churn when a node is renamed,
 *    which turns a no-op rename into a pipeline diff nobody can read. The
 *    input order is an authored fact and it is kept.
 * 3. **A cycle is reported, never broken.** Breaking one picks a winner
 *    silently, and the pipeline then runs in an order no one chose. Every
 *    node in the cycle is named — naming one of them sends the reader to fix
 *    the wrong edge.
 * 4. **A missing dependency is reported, never dropped.** `needs: ["x"]` with
 *    no `x` is a claim that failed, and a runner that silently ran the node
 *    anyway would report a clean pass over a broken graph. This is the `dh4f`
 *    defect in ordering form.
 *
 * ## `fatal` is per step, and that is the owner's design
 *
 * > current state of KG renderered as json/jsonld failuer = fatal, readme
 * > updated faliure = fatal , dynamic parts (kg vierwe, visaluzers, etc)
 * > render in flattened depndency order, failures = skip/log/qa or so
 *
 * So the runner cannot own one policy: two steps must stop the build and the
 * rest must not. Carrying it on the STEP means the policy is declared beside
 * the thing it governs and is visible in the flattened list, rather than
 * living in whichever `if` the runner happens to have.
 *
 * A `fatal` step that fails ends the run. A non-fatal one is recorded as
 * `skipped` — and so is every step that needed it, because running a step
 * whose input never rendered produces output that LOOKS complete. That
 * cascade is the whole reason skip is not the same as "carry on".
 *
 * @module schemas/dependency-order
 * @graphNode none — an ordering function library: it defines no schema
