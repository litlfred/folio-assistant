/**
 * A block kind as a KG node: `folio-block-kind/v1`, one JSON file per kind in
 * a `block-kinds/` graph the OWNING harness declares (bean riit, step 2; sod4
 * finding #1).
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-04: every contribution is a node; *"block kinds first"*; the
 * nodes live with their owners now (document kinds in folio-assistant-core,
 * the math kinds in folio-assistant-sci's paper adapter, option 2 of 3); and
 * *"kinds need to be discoverable … not centrally managed"*. So no module
 * lists the kinds: `block-kinds.ts` DISCOVERS them by scanning every
 * instance's declared `block-kinds` graph, and each per-kind fact the old
 * parallel tables held (label prefix, RDF types, builder, profile, whether a
 * label is provable, whether the definition index lists it) is a field here.
 *
 * Headings are NOT here beyond the English source string: the owner put
 * locale headings in the translation graph (option 1 of 2).
 *
 * A LEAF: Zod only, so `block-kinds.ts` (itself a leaf every schema imports
 * at module load) can parse with it without a cycle.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/schemas/block-kind-node
