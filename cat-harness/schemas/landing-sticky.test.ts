/**
 * A PUBLISHED CARD ID DOES NOT MOVE WITH ITS DIRECTORY — bean `8xtj`.
 *
 * The comment below `CORE` states this rule. It was stated and not asserted,
 * and on 2026-09-20 a session swept `folio-assist-core` → `folio-assistant-core`
 * across 103 files, renaming the published card id along with the directory.
 * **`bun test` stayed at 0 fail**, `tsc` and `eslint` were clean, and sixteen
 * check scripts were green. It surfaced only because the reverting session
 * compared `docs/_data/stickies.json` against `main` by hand.
 *
 * ## Why the literal assertions below did not catch it, and this does
 *
 * `landing-sticky.test.ts` already names `"folio-assist-core"` in four places.
 * They did not fire because **the sweep renamed them too** — a `sed` over the
 * repository moves a test's literal exactly as readily as the value it guards,
 * so an assertion written as a copy of its subject is satisfied by any edit
 * that changes both. That is the general hazard, not a lapse in this file.
 *
 * So this asserts a RELATION instead: which declared sticky ids differ from
 * their own instance directory. A sweep collapsing the divergence makes the
 * differing set EMPTY, and a sweep introducing a new one makes it larger.
 * Neither can be satisfied by renaming both sides, because "they differ" is
 * not a string any sed matches.
 *
 * ## It is pinned to one pair on purpose
 *
 * Measured across every declaration: `bootstrap` and `cat-harness` have
 * `sticky.id === directory`, and `folio-assistant-core` is the ONE that
 * differs. So divergence is the exception rather than the rule here, which is
 * why the assertion is an exact set rather than a count — a count of one would
 * still pass if the divergence moved to a different instance, and that is a
 * different repository from this one.
