/**
 * Tool profiles — a named set of tool releases a run selects as one.
 *
 * @module schemas/tool-profile
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * Step 1 of `docs/proposals/tool-releases-2026-10-07.md` (issue #2481, bean
 * `3sbm`), §2. The owner, 2026-10-07: *"in testing scenarios we will need to
 * load different sets/releases of tools easily"*. A test scenario selects a
 * profile (`default`, `ci-2026-10`, `lean-4.12-test`); the resolver (step 2,
 * not built here) provisions every release it names.
 *
 * ## A profile names tools, never a runtime
 *
 * Runtimes come in transitively, through each release's own `runtimes[]`.
 * A profile that named a JRE would be pinning java for every tool in it — the
 * global pin the owner ruled out (*"different tools may need different
 * instances of java"*). So:
 *
 * - **structurally**, every key of `tools` must equal the name of the release
 *   it maps to. `plantuml: "temurin-jre@21.0.4+7"` is refused by the schema;
 * - **against the graph**, {@link toolReleaseGraphProblems} refuses a profile
 *   whose ref resolves to a release declared `role: "runtime"`. The schema
 *   alone cannot see that, because which releases are runtimes is a fact
 *   about OTHER files.
 *
 * ## Why the graph checks live here
 *
 * They need both families, and `tool-release.ts` must not import this module
 * back. Everything a check needs to reject a profile or a dangling runtime ref
 * is in {@link toolReleaseGraphProblems}; `scripts/tool-releases.ts --check`
 * runs it over every declared directory.

/**
 * Problems across the WHOLE set of releases and profiles an instance can see.
 *
 * What one file's schema cannot know, because the answer is in another file:
 *
 * 1. two records for one `name@version` on one platform — two answers to
 *    "which bytes";
 * 2. a `runtimes[]` ref that resolves to no release;
 * 3. a `runtimes[]` ref whose release declares no `entry.home` — injection
 *    sets `JAVA_HOME` to it, or puts `<home>/bin` on `PATH`, so without one
 *    there is nothing to inject. A `role: "tool"` release MAY be a runtime
 *    of another: graphviz is a tool in its own right, and PlantUML finds its
 *    `dot` through `PATH` (measured 2026-10-07: `plantuml -testdot` with
 *    only the two cached releases on `PATH` reports graphviz 16.1.0);
 * 4. a profile ref that resolves to no release;
 * 5. **a profile ref that resolves to a runtime** — the global pin by another
 *    name;
 * 6. two profiles with one name.
 *
 * Empty means none. A ref resolves when ANY platform's record matches it: the
 * resolver picks the host's, and a ref with no record for the host is the
 * resolver's `could-not-provision`, not a malformed graph.
