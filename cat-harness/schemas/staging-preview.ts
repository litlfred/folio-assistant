/**
 * `staging-preview` — a node of the trashcan that describes one review preview.
 *
 * @module schemas/staging-preview
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## Why this is a trashcan node and not a first-class one
 *
 * A staging preview is SDLC churn by definition: it exists for one review and
 * is meant to die. `fsh-guts` is the declared non-renderable graph for exactly
 * that (bean `t0i3`), and `UNPUBLISHED_GRAPH_KINDS` keeps it out of every other
 * published artefact while `<base>/fsh-guts.jsonld` stays reachable BY NAME.
 * So these records are addressable without a crawler ever arriving at one by
 * following an edge — which is the property you want for something whose whole
 * point is that it is temporary.
 *
 * ## The node owns its lifecycle — that is the whole design
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-19, on where the write and remove logic belongs: *"that's part
 * of the behaviour of that node type."*
 *
 * So creation, enrichment and retirement are functions HERE, and the things
 * that happen to touch a preview — the deploy, the label cleanup, the dispatch
 * cleanup, the health sweep — invoke them rather than each reimplementing the
 * rule. Put the rule in the workflow and there are three answers to "is this
 * preview still live", free to disagree.
 *
 * **This shape is already latent in the code, arrived at from the other
 * direction.** `previewLiveness` in `test/health/checks.ts` is a single
 * function called from both the sweep and the removal preflight, written that
 * way precisely so the two cannot disagree. What is missing is the declaration
 * saying the node type owns it, and a published document letting anything else
 * read the answer.
 *
 * ## Two moments know different things, and neither knows everything
 *
 * | | knows | does not know |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | deploy (`feature-staging.yml`) | branch, commit, PR, issue, host, built-at | size, liveness |
 * | sweep (`test/health/probes.ts`) | size, file count, liveness | the PR and issue |
 *
 * Hence {@link createStagingPreview} takes the first set and
 * {@link enrichStagingPreview} adds the second. The record exists from the
 * moment the preview does, which is what makes "cannot outlive the preview"
 * enforceable rather than aspirational: a record that only appears at the next
 * sweep cannot be checked against a preview that was removed before it.
 *
 * ## Retirement is a state, never a deletion
 *
 * Same rule as a bean's `scrapped` and a memory node's `archived`, and for the
 * same reason: a removed record leaves the next reader unable to tell
 * "deliberately cleaned up" from "lost". {@link retireStagingPreview} sets
 * `retiredOn` and a reason and keeps everything else, so the record of a
 * preview that is gone still says what it was for.
 *
 * ## Two measured facts about the trashcan — one since fixed, one still real
 *
 * Both were probed rather than assumed. When this module shipped they were
 * why it carried its own reader; one of them is now gone.
 *
 * 1. **FIXED 2026-09-20.** `FshGutsNodeSchema` was a plain `z.object`, so zod
 *    dropped unknown keys and `readFshGutsNode` returned a node with no
 *    `staging` at all, silently. It now carries `.passthrough()`: `kind` is
 *    open, so the field set could not stay closed.
 * 2. **STILL TRUE.** `schemas/front-matter.ts` is a FLAT parser
 *    (`Record<string, string | string[]>`). A nested `staging:` block parses
 *    to `[]` before any schema sees it — so a markdown node survives the
 *    schema and still loses the data, which is worse than losing it outright
 *    because `[]` looks like an answer.
 *
 * (2) is why the carrier is JSON, and that has not changed. What has changed
 * is that `<base>/fsh-guts.jsonld` now DOES carry these records: the exporter
 * reads a JSON node of this graph and emits a kind's own fields under `data`.
 * The log exclusion is untouched — membership is still `$schema`, so a
 * `folio-log/v1` entry is excluded by what it says it is.
 *
 * {@link readStagingPreview} therefore stays as a TYPED reader — it returns a
 * `StagingPreviewNode` and refuses another kind by name — rather than as a
 * workaround for a reader that could not see the fields.
