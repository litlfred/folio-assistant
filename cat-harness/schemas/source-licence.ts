/**
 * A source's licence, as one record wherever it is written — bean `7bg9`.
 *
 * @module schemas/source-licence
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * The record `check:source-licence` has read from a library entry's
 * `manifest.jsonld` since issue #1023 — as `licenceRecord` since finding D4
 * (bean `gzkt`, 2026-10-03), `meta.licence` before — moved here unchanged so
 * that an upload's `intake.json` can carry the SAME record rather than a second
 * licence vocabulary (the bean's own rule: read the existing vocabulary before
 * designing a field).
 *
 * ## Three states, never two
 *
 * | `status`  | means                                        | must carry |
 * |-----------|----------------------------------------------|------------|
 * | `stated`  | the licence is known                         | `id` and `basis`: where it is stated |
 * | `unknown` | somebody looked and could not establish it   | `searched`: one entry per place tried |
 * | (absent)  | nobody has recorded anything                 | nothing |
 *
 * `unknown` and absent are different facts, and neither is ever reported as
 * cleared.
