/**
 * Node kinds with more than one parent, composed by the platform's one
 * resolve-then-walk. Bean `a1lq`.
 *
 * @module schemas/node-kind
 * @graphNode none — a composition function over other modules' schemas, not a schema
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-23, on a review comment being built as a todo:
 *
 * > thhemed todo? we didnt discuss mult-iheritence of harness or node kinds.
 * > we need to have that. once depedencies of (orderd) dependecy tree are
 * > full resolve, walk tree in order starting w/ deepest depenencies
 *
 * and then *"make sure consistent"*. Instances already had a walk. Node kinds
 * had none: a kind with two parents was a Zod `.extend()` with a spread, and
 * when two parents defined one field, whichever spread came last won, silently.
 * Nothing declared a kind's parents, so nothing could walk them.
 *
 * ## The rule is the instances' rule, from the same module
 *
 * A kind DECLARES its parents. {@link nodeKind} resolves every ancestor, orders
 * them with `flattenDependencies` from `schemas/dependency-order.ts` (deepest
 * first, ties on declared parent order), and composes each ancestor's OWN shape
 * in that order. The instance resolver in `harness-config.ts` calls the same
 * flattener. Two answers to "what order do layers compose in" would be free to
 * disagree, so there is one.
 *
 * ## Refused, at the moment the kind is defined
 *
 * - **A field two unrelated ancestors define** (`findConflicts`): the order
 *   between them means nothing, so it must not pick a value.
 * - **A redefinition the child did not declare.** Overriding an inherited field
 *   is allowed and must be said, in `overrides`, so a field that shadows a
 *   parent's by accident is caught rather than shipped.
 * - **A declared override that overrides nothing**, which is a stale claim.
 *
 * All three throw where the kind is defined, i.e. on module load, so the first
 * test that imports the kind fails. A composition error that surfaced only when
 * a file was validated would ship.
 *
 * ## Parents are objects, not ids
 *
 * A kind names its parents by reference, so the graph is the import graph and
 * there is no global registry to be loaded in the wrong order — a failure this
 * repository has paid for (`bunfig.toml`, 2026-09-20). A parent may be a
 * tagged kind (`todo/1.0.0`) or a named mixin (`themed`), which has no
 * `$schema` of its own. Both are kinds here, because both are layers.
