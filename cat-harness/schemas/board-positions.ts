/**
 * Where a note sits on a board — a layer ON TOP of the notes, never inside them.
 *
 * ## The ruling this encodes, and the word that decides the design
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20, choosing between four options with the merge hazard
 * stated, then clarifying twice:
 *
 * > Committed, one positions file per board.
 *
 * > **it lives on top of notes, not data within notes.**
 *
 * > it can be one file...
 *
 * > **notes exist lower down than folio. make sure arrows correct.**
 *
 * The second is the one that constrains the code. A note gains no `x`, no `y`,
 * no `board`, no `order`. This layer names notes BY ID and the relation points
 * one way:
 *
 *     folio  ──▶  board  ──▶  position  ──▶  note        allowed
 *     note   ──▶  position / board / folio                REFUSED
 *
 * Four things follow, and each is a property the per-note alternative could
 * not have had:
 *
 * 1. **A note is complete with no board.** `readTodoFiles`, the todo index,
 *    the sticky board and the QA sidecars are untouched, and a folio that
 *    never opens a board has nothing extra in its work plan. The layer is
 *    ADDITIVE and REMOVABLE: delete this file and every note is what it was.
 * 2. **One note may sit on several boards**, at different places, without the
 *    note arbitrating between them.
 * 3. **The layers stay clean.** A note is `content` or `state` depending on
 *    its graph; this is unambiguously `state`, written by a running process.
 *    A coordinate on a note would make a `content` node carry `state`, which
 *    `content-context-and-state-graphs` refuses.
 * 4. **An orphan is swept from the LAYER**, which is the easy direction: one
 *    file, one pass, and nothing edited out of a note a person owns.
 *
 * It is the same one-way shape `uses[]` already enforces between the editorial
 * relation and the derived dependency graph, and for the same reason: mixing
 * the two destroys the signal each carries.
 *
 * ## ONE file, with the board as a key
 *
 * Not one file per board. The board is a key inside this document, so a new
 * board adds lines rather than a file, and the merge property below holds the
 * same whether there is one board or twenty.
 *
 * ## Mergeability is the whole reason for the shape
 *
 * Positions are the most concurrently-edited state a folio has — two sessions
 * moving two notes is the ordinary case, not the exceptional one. The fix is
 * the one `gen-docs-pages.ts` proved on 2026-09-20 and recorded:
 *
 * > Minified, this file is ONE LINE of ~12 KB. Git merges text by line, so a
 * > single line means any change on both sides of a merge is a whole-file
 * > conflict — two branches adding two different todos cannot both win. That
 * > is not hypothetical: it conflicted on three consecutive merges of one
 * > branch on 2026-09-20, every time.
 *
 * So: **indented, one position per line, sorted by board then note id.** Two
 * sessions moving DIFFERENT notes merge untouched.
 *
 * **It is a partial fix and the limit is known.** Two notes that sort ADJACENT
 * still conflict, because the inserted lines overlap. This removes the
 * guaranteed conflict, not every conflict, and saying so is the point — a
 * mergeability claim nobody bounded is one somebody will over-trust.
 *
 * **The ordering must be deterministic or the property is worthless**: a
 * writer that emitted positions in map order would reshuffle on every save and
 * conflict anyway. {@link sortPositions} is that guarantee, and it is tested
 * rather than assumed.
 *
 * @graphNode schema
 * @module schemas/board-positions
 *
 * ## ONE position per note per board, in the TYPE rather than in one function
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20, choosing between three: **"One per board — make it
 * structural."**
 *
 * The first draft stored an ARRAY of `{note, x, y}` per board, so the type
 * admitted a note twice while `place()` filtered by note before appending, so
 * the code forbade it. **One fact with two answers and nothing asserting they
 * agree** — which is the exact shape of the failures `data-modelling` cites as
 * its own worked examples (`sym3`, `85e8`). A hand-written file, a merge that
 * kept both sides, or any writer that did not go through `place()` produced a
 * document the schema accepted and every consumer then had to decide about.
 *
 * Keyed by note id, the question cannot be asked. `boards[board][note]` is one
 * position or none, and "which of the two is the real one?" stops being a
 * state anybody has to handle.
 *
 * **It costs nothing in mergeability, which was the reason for the shape.**
 * Keys still sort, each note still occupies its own lines under an indented
 * write, and two sessions placing two different notes still merge untouched.
 * If anything it is better: a note's position now has a stable ADDRESS in the
 * text rather than a place in a sequence, so a move edits one line-block in
 * situ instead of potentially reordering its neighbours.
 *

 * and writes is a caller that can be wrong about which document it read from —

 *
 * ## A note that is NOT placed is not moved
 *
 * `undefined` rather than a throw, and rather than placing it at the delta as
 * though the origin were its position. "Move it from where it is" has no
 * answer for a note that is nowhere, and answering anyway would put it
 * somewhere nobody chose. A caller that wants it placed calls {@link place},

 *
 * ## It touches the LAYER and nothing else
