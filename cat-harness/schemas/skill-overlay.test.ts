 * `resolveDirectories` seeded `DEFAULT_DIRECTORIES` at the root link whatever

 * declaration **at all** — so the declaration's mere existence withdrew every

 * `directories` defaults to `[]` in the schema, which made the minimal honest
 * declaration the worst case: `{ "name": "x" }` adds a name and silently
 * empties the result. `resolveSkillDirs` goes through `ownDirectories`, so a
 * fixture with a `skills/` directory sitting on disk went from **3 to 0**
 * the moment it was given a name — and a consumer reads that as "this
 * instance has no skills", not as "somebody named it".
