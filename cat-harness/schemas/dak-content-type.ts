/**
 * The `dak` and `sushi` content types — registered by the WHO layer, not by core.
 *
 * @module schemas/dak-content-type
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * These two were written into `content-types-base.ts` first, under a comment
 * arguing that recognising a type is not claiming it and that the entries could
 * move to a WHO adapter later. `check:partition:edges` refused that within
 * minutes:
 *
 * ```
 * schemas/content-types-base.ts [folio-assist-core] -> schemas/dak.ts [smart-base]
 * A repo may not import one that depends on it.
 * ```
 *
 * The comment was right about where they belong and wrong that it could wait.
 * `smart-base` depends on core; core recognising a DAK means core importing
 * downstream, and it is not avoidable by intent — recognising `dak.config.json`
 * requires `DAK_TYPE`, and reaching for it *is* the edge. A boundary argued in
 * prose is a boundary that does not hold; this one is held by the import graph.
 *
 * Same shape as `folio-graph-kind.ts`, and for the same reason: the layer that
 * owns the model registers the entry at load time, and the layer that cannot
 * serve it does not name it.
 *
 * ## Registering is still not claiming
 *
 * `dak`'s `type` is WHO's own logical model IRI, not ours. `sushi`'s is minted
 * in our namespace and the constant says why: SUSHI publishes no logical model
 * for its config, so a WHO or HL7 IRI would imply an authority we do not have,
 * while our own is at least honest about who is speaking.

 * reaches our vocabulary, which is honest; an HL7 IRI would not be.
