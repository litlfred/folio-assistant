/**
 * Theme art arriving as three files — accepted, or refused with a reason.
 *
 * @module schemas/theme-art-intake
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20: *"make skills for avatar theme ingestion (need 3
 * meeting certain formatting constraints), return sucches or explnation of
 * falire"*, and then, scoping it: *"make as part of docuemtn ingestion
 * skill...."*
 *
 * So this is **not a second ingestion process.** Document ingestion already
 * answers the question this poses — *something unstructured has arrived; is it
 * acceptable, and if not, why not* — and already has the shape of the answer: a
 * pipeline with a completeness gate. Theme art is the same event with a
 * different payload, so what is added is a **check keyed on the payload**, not a
 * parallel pipeline free to disagree with the first.
 *
 * ## Every constraint here was paid for, not invented
 *
 * Each is a failure this repository actually took, in the two commits that
 * delivered theme art during the session that prompted the ask:
 *
 * | constraint | what went wrong |
 * |---|---|
 * | {@link THEME_ART_LAYOUTS} complete | `landing-architecture` is declared with **laptop and card only**. `resolveThemeBackdrop` refuses an incomplete backdrop wholesale, so the theme silently renders with no art at all. |
 * | distinct content | commit `1b62b57` supplied 3 files for 3 avatars of which **two were byte-identical** — same sha256, same 1,606,269 bytes. Two distinct images for three named roles. |
 * | orientation per layout | a portrait crop is not a landscape crop scaled down; the quiet area a sticky's text sits in moves. |
 * | dimensions **measured** | `landing-engineer` is 1672×941 where its siblings are 1671×941. One pixel, retyped from a neighbour, and `images[].width` becomes a false declaration. |
 * | weight and format | the arriving PNGs were ~1.6 MB against ~100 KB webp siblings — **16×**. |
 * | a declared destination | commit `0301fbd2` put three PNGs at the **repository root**, undeclared, with spaces and commas in their names. No gate saw them: `check-declared-assets` walks declared→disk, and the root is not an instance. |
 *
 * ## The contract: success, or a NAMED failure
 *
 * The ask's own words, and the contract this repository already uses for its
 * `--check` gates and its kg-audit sidecars. A refusal that says *invalid*
 * teaches nobody what to fix, so every {@link ThemeArtFailure} carries the
 * layout it is about, what was found, and **what to do about it**.
 *
 * All failures are collected rather than thrown one at a time: art arrives as a
 * batch, and reporting the first problem in a set of three means three round
 * trips to learn three things.
 *
 * ## Dimensions are READ, never accepted
 *
 * {@link measureImage} parses the file header. The 1px drift is what happens
 * when a declaration is composed by copying a neighbour's numbers, so this
 * module takes bytes and emits the declaration — the caller is never asked for
 * a width, and therefore cannot supply a wrong one.

 * refuse a perfectly good 2× render. What must not vary is the SHAPE, because
 * the layouts exist to be different shapes — a `mobile` file that is landscape
 * is a laptop crop under the wrong name, and it will be served to a phone.
 *
 * Bands are wide on purpose. Measured against the live declaration, the shipped
 * laptop crops run 1.50–1.78 and the mobile crops 0.56–0.67, so a narrow band
