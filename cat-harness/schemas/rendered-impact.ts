/**
 * What a change does to a RENDERED site: the contract every renderer answers
 * (bean `bnjs`, issue #971).
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-06: *"each renderer should be able to give you from list of
 * input changed files, the list of output changed rendered files ... from the
 * dependency cone"*, and a Change Set's PR is reviewed against that list.
 *
 * ## The contract
 *
 * A renderer takes the input files a change touched and returns a
 * `rendered-impact/v1`: every rendered file the change alters, each with the
 * chain that reached it (`via`) and a `role`, plus every input it could NOT
 * place. Two methods produce one:
 *
 * - `cone`: predicted from the renderer's dependency cone, BEFORE a build.
 *   What a reviewer is shown while the build runs, and what an incremental
 *   build re-renders.
 * - `build-diff`: measured by comparing two built sites (`diffBuiltSites`).
 *   The check on a prediction: a file in the build diff that the cone did not
 *   name is a cone defect, and is reported as one (`comparePrediction`).
 *
 * ## Three rules
 *
 * 1. **Could-not-determine is never "no change".** An input the renderer cannot
 *    place goes in `undetermined` with its reason; an empty `files` with a
 *    non-empty `undetermined` means "not known", and a consumer must say so.
 * 2. **Index files are listed, and marked, not dropped.** The owner reviews
 *    content pages, not search indexes, so a list for review filters on
 *    `role !== "index"`; but a page that is an index for one renderer is
 *    content for another, so the renderer marks the role and the reader
 *    filters, never the other way round.
 * 3. **A page whose BYTES do not change can still change.** An AST artefact
 *    page loads its resource in the browser, so a changed resource changes
 *    what the page shows while its HTML stays identical. The cone names the
 *    page (`role: "content"`) AND the data file (`role: "data"`); a build diff
 *    sees only the data file. `comparePrediction` therefore never counts a
 *    predicted content page that is missing from the build diff as a defect.
 *
 * ## A PIN: what a review of a rendered file is a review OF
 *
 * The coverage gate counts a page as reviewed only against the version a
 * reviewer saw, as a block verdict is pinned to the block's hash. A page's
 * built bytes are no pin: a staging build injects a banner naming the commit,
 * so every page would reopen on every push. So `hash` pins a predicted file
 * to the git blobs of the changed inputs on its `via` ({@link pinImpact}),
 * and an undetermined input to its own blob. An edit after review moves the
 * pin of exactly the files and inputs it touched. A build diff pins a file to
 * its content hash, taken before the banner is added.
 *
 * @graphNode schema
 * @module cat-harness/schemas/rendered-impact
