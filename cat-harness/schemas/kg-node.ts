/**
 * The two labels every knowledge-graph node may carry.
 *
 * A node here is anything the graph names: a declared directory, a role, an
 * actor, a bean-graph node, a skill, a process. They arrived with four
 * different spellings of the same two ideas — `name` + `summary` on a role,
 * `name` + `description` on an actor, bare `summary` on a directory, `title` in
 * a bean's front matter — which is three renames waiting to happen and, worse,
 * three things a consumer has to know before it can print a node.
 *
 * So: **`title` is what a reader sees, `description` is the sentence under it.**
 * Both optional in general; a node type may require either, and several do —
 * `kg-audit` reports a role with no narrative, because a role nobody can
 * describe is a lane nobody can fill.
 *
 * ## `title` is not `id`, and not `name`
 *
 * `id` is the handle other nodes reference. `name` — where a node still has one
 * — is the instance's own identifier, the thing `harness.json` calls
 * `folio-assistant` and publishes artefacts under. `title` is neither: it is
 * display text, it may contain punctuation an identifier could not, and it is
 * **translatable**. `WHO SMART Base` is a title; `smart-base` is a name.
 *
 * **Having one is a decision, and the default is not to.** {@link displayTitle}
 * falls back to `name`, and `cat-harness.ts` requires `name` to be the
 * identifier every artefact is stub-named after — so an instance whose display
 * text should match its repository wants no `title` at all, rather than a
 * `title` repeating the `name` and free to drift from it.
 *
 * This example used to be `c@t-harness` / `folio-assistant`, drawn from this
 * repository's own declaration, and that was the wrong illustration twice
 * over: the title it cited labelled THIS repository with the brand of the
 * harness layer still to be split out of it, and the sidebar showed a name
 * that matched neither the repository nor the URL people arrive at. Removed
 * 2026-09-19; the derivation it named survives in the `description`, which is
 * where a tagline belongs.
 *
 * ## Translatable means extractable
 *
 * {@link KG_NODE_LABEL_FIELDS} is the list a translation extractor reads, so
 * adding a third label later is one edit here rather than a sweep through every
 * extractor. Nothing else in a KG declaration is offered for translation: an
 * id, a path or a graph kind is structure, and translating structure is how a
 * reference goes dangling — the same rule `bpmn-translate.ts` follows.
 *
 * @module schemas/kg-node

   * fractions are square only on a square image, and believing that of a

   *
   * **An image that declares no dimensions may not declare one at all.** That
   * is a determined refusal rather than a gap: a box whose squareness cannot
   * be checked is exactly the case this field exists to stop, and accepting it
   * unchecked would put the one unverifiable box among six verified ones.
   *

 * A declared non-image artefact of an instance — `AGENTS.md` first among them.
 *
 * ## Why this is not {@link KgImageSchema} with a wider type
 *
 * An image carries `layout`, `width`, `height` and `textRegion` because a
 * renderer picks between crops. An `AGENTS.md` has no crops. Widening the
 * image schema would give every asset four fields that are meaningless for it
 * and optional for images, so nothing could tell a missing `width` from an
 * inapplicable one.
 *
 * The **vocabulary is shared on purpose**: `id`, `src`, `role`, and the label
 * shape, exactly as an image declares them. Two spellings of `role` is the
 * drift this repository keeps paying for.
 *
 * ## Why declare it at all
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-19: `AGENTS.md` is the only root artefact this instance
 * does not declare — `harness.json` carries `directories[]` and `images[]` and
 * it is in neither. Bean `v8gh` is what that costs: seven dead links in it,
 * five broken by a single directory move, including the one its own banner
 * calls the place to start, so a cold agent following the banner hit a 404.
 * Nothing caught them, because `readme:audit` checks `README.md` alone and
 * `check:agents-xref` checks citations INTO the file rather than links out.
 *
 * Declaring it is what makes a check follow rather than be special-cased.

 * Which ROOT a declared path is relative to — the instance's, or the

 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * An instance root and a repository root were the **same directory** until the
 * move (bean `wggr`), so every declared path answered both questions at once
 * and nothing had to say which it meant. Afterwards four directories and both
 * assets resolved one level too deep, producing the `dh4f` shape from the
 * inside: `beans/` resolved to `cat-harness/beans/`, a consumer scanned
 * nothing, and 32 tests failed on a store that was sitting at the repository
 * root the whole time.
 *
 * ## Why a field rather than `"../beans/"`
 *
 * A traversal spells the *mechanism* and states no fact. It is also refused:
 * `check-harness-dirs.ts` rejects **every** dot-prefixed segment, and `..`
 * is one — the guard would have to be weakened to admit the escape it exists
 * to prevent. A declared `scope` says what the directory belongs to, leaves
 * `path` clean, and puts the one `repoRootFor` call in the resolver instead of
 * a `..` in each of six declarations.
 *
 * ## What `repository` implies beyond the path
 *
 * **It is not inherited.** A dependency's repository is not this one's, so a
 * repository-scoped entry reaching this instance through the dependency chain
 * would name somebody else's `beans/`. `resolveDirectories` skips those, which
 * is how the never-overlaid property of `beans/` and `todos/` stops being
 * something an agent has to remember.

 * this repository's own `AGENTS.md` banner describes, one level down.
