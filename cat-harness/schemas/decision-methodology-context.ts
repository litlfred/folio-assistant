/**
 * The context an agent provides when asking "which decision methodology fits?"
 *
 * Complements {@link MethodologyFrontMatterSchema} — that schema declares what a
 * methodology IS; this one declares what a decision NEEDS. The selector skill
 * matches a `DecisionContext` against each methodology's `applies-when` and the
 * method-family criteria tables.
 *
 * ## Relationship to decision-request.ts
 *
 * `decision-request.ts` shapes a decision already handed to a person — the
 * options, their pros/cons, the recommendation. THIS module shapes the question
 * BEFORE that: "what method should I use to analyse those options?" One runs
 * before the other: you pick a method (this schema), then you use it to
 * produce a decision request (that schema).
 *
 * ## Why every dimension is optional
 *
 * An agent provides what it knows. A context with only `questionType` still
 * routes via methodology-adoption's four-question protocol. Adding dimensions
 * narrows the ranking. A schema that required all of them would be unusable at
 * the point it is most needed — the early stage when the problem is half-formed.
 *
