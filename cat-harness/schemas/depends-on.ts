/**
 * depends-on.ts — `instance-versioning.md` §3.4's record, and the gaps it

 *
 * Three fields, deliberately FHIR's and not this repository's: `packageId`,
 * `version`, `uri` are what `ImplementationGuide.dependsOn` carries, and the
 * whole purpose of the record is that a consumer already knows how to read it.
 * Renaming them to this repository's spellings would mean a downstream
 * translating a structure it can otherwise consume directly — and `qa-report.ts`
 * already settled that argument the same way, keeping upstream's snake_case.
 *
 * ## A dependency that cannot be expressed is REPORTED, never dropped
 *
 * Most instances here are not publishable and §3.1 says that is correct, so
 * most edges out of a publishable instance will be to something that has no
 * `id` and no `version`. Emitting `dependsOn: []` in that case would state
 * that the instance depends on nothing, which is false. Emitting a partial
 * record with an empty `version` would be worse: a consumer resolves it and
 * fails. So each such edge becomes a {@link DependsOnGap} carrying WHICH of
 * the reasons applies, and a reader can tell "depends on nothing" from
 * "depends on four things none of which is publishable".
 *
 * That is the `dh4f` rule applied to an edge rather than a directory, and the
 * distinction it preserves is exactly the one §3.1 spent a third state on:
 * `undecided` (nobody said) and `internal` (somebody said no) are different
 * gaps with different remedies.
