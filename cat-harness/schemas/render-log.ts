/**
 * The render log — what was published to the publish branch, when, and why.
 *
 * @module schemas/render-log
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-20: *"a specialised Logger skill for the gh-pages rendering
 * context … log all staging rendering (when added, when deleted) to a logging
 * directory/file on gh-pages."*
 *
 * ## It is a SPECIALISATION of `folio-log/v1`, not a second logger
 *
 * `schemas/log-entry.ts` already answers "what does an entry look like":
 * `id`, `at`, `summary`, `detail`, `references`, and a three-state `capture`.
 * Re-spelling those here would be two vocabularies for one concept, and the
 * first divergence would be silent. So a render entry IS a log entry, with a
 * rendering event and a rendering subject.
 *
 * **Three things make it a different store, and each is a deliberate
 * difference rather than an accident:**
 *
 * | | activity log (`folio-log/v1`) | render log (this) |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | subject | what an AGENT did | what was PUBLISHED |
 * | store | `fsh-guts/logs/`, in the repo | the publish branch itself |
 * | published | **no**, by owner decision | **yes**, deliberately |
 *
 * That last row is the one to read twice. The activity log is unpublished
 * because it is an agent's audit trail; this one lives on the publish branch
 * because it describes what is ON the publish branch, and a record of a
 * deleted artefact is worthless anywhere the artefact's absence cannot be
 * seen. Neither decision overrides the other — they are different logs.
 *
 * ## Append-only, and that is the point
 *
 * The design this replaces wrote one record per preview and then had to stop
 * three separate paths from deleting it. A log does not need that: an entry
 * is never rewritten, a removal is a NEW entry rather than the erasure of an
 * old one, and "what happened to `STAGING/x`" is answered by reading forward
 * rather than by hoping a file survived.
 *
 * So `removed` does not delete the `rendered` entry that precedes it. The
 * pair IS the history, and a log holding only the survivors is a log that has
 * lost the thing it was kept for.
 *
 * ## What is NOT here
 *
 * No size, no liveness. Those are the health sweep's knowledge, and
 * `health-check.yml` is `contents: read` deliberately — "It reports and never
 * acts". A log entry records an EVENT at the moment it happened; a measured
 * property that changes afterwards belongs to whatever measures it.

 *
 * - `rendered` — published, or re-published over itself. A re-deploy is a
 *   rendering, so it gets its own entry: "when was this last built" is a
 *   question the log should answer without anybody diffing commits.
 * - `removed` — taken down. Never erases the `rendered` entries before it.
 * - `restored` — carried across a full-replace deploy by `restore-staging`.
 *   Its own event rather than a second `rendered`, because "somebody pushed
 *   this branch" and "an unrelated merge nearly deleted it" are different
 *   facts, and bean `plj1` is what happens when the second is invisible.
 * - `retained` — a removal was CONSIDERED and refused, with the reason. The
 *   one that makes the log worth reading: a preview that is still here
 *   because a liveness signal fired leaves no trace otherwise, and the next
 *   person asking "why is this still up" has nothing to read.
