/**
 * `RouteMemberSchema` validates UNTRUSTED input, so these are adversarial
 * cases rather than examples.
 *
 * A `route-family` member derives from a branch name, and
 * `.github/workflows/feature-staging.yml` states the consequence in as many
 * words: *"the branch name is ATTACKER-CONTROLLED on a fork PR"*. A member key
 * becomes a path on the published `gh-pages` branch, so a traversal here writes
 * outside the family's prefix — over the published site at `/`, in the worst
 * case. Bean `xp5j`.
 *
 * The schema REFUSES rather than sanitises, and that is the design: a key that
 * had to be cleaned up is a key whose author meant something else, and a
 * sanitiser's output is a value nobody declared.

/**
 * THE DRIFT GUARD, and it exists because this branch caused the defect it
 * guards.
 *
 * Bean `1j3q`: `DirectoryStorageSchema.keyedBy` held its own
 * `z.enum(["commit","tip","route"])` while `KeyedBySchema` in
 * `subgraph-source.ts` is what every consumer parses through. `route` was added
 * to the first and not the second, so a route-keyed declaration PARSED and then
 * threw a ZodError inside `resolveSubgraphSource`. Main fixed it by importing
 * the one enum, with the rule: *a schema change somebody has to make is only a
 * guard if there is ONE schema to change.*
 *
 * This branch then added `route-family` to the copy in `cat-harness.ts` —
 * reproducing `1j3q` one keying later, accepted by the declaration and rejected
 * by every consumer. Nothing caught it; main's fix landed independently and the
 * merge is what exposed it.
 *
 * So the guard is behavioural rather than a comment: the two must AGREE on
 * every value, in both directions. A future keying added to one and not the
 * other fails here instead of at a consumer's parse.
