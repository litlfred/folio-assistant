/**
 * `structure.json` as a BASE with VARIANTS — bean `rkqp`, owner 2026-09-30
 * ("A+B", after a measured analysis).
 *
 * @module schemas/document-structure
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## Why a base, and why `pdf-structure/v1` is not renamed
 *
 * Measured before this was written: 17 readers take `structure.json`. Nine
 * read only fields every format has (a section's id, number, title, level and
 * sizes; the document's title). Three read `page_start` / `page_end` and
 * already treat them as optional. One (`check-l1-complete`) validates strictly
 * against the PDF schema. Four are PDF-only tools. So the base mostly WRITES
 * DOWN what the readers already assume, and nothing in the 43 committed PDF
 * files changes: `pdf-structure/v1` stays exactly as it is, as one variant.
 *
 * ## The one thing a variant must add: where a section IS
 *
 * A PDF section is located by pages; a notebook section by cells. The two are
 * not the same unit and must not be read as one, so {@link structureOf}
 * returns a `locator` that says which it is. A reader that wants pages asks
 * for `kind: "pages"` and gets nothing from a notebook, rather than a cell
 * index mistaken for a page number.
 *
 * ## Read it through the accessor
 *
 * {@link structureOf} is the one way to read a `structure.json` whose format
 * is not known in advance. A reader that parses the file itself learns one
 * variant and silently misreads the next, which is the drift this exists to
 * stop. A third format (HTML, DOCX) is a new variant here and no reader
 * changes.
