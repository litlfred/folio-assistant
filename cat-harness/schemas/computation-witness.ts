/**
 * `computation-witness/v1` — the runtime schema for a folio's
 * `<name>.witness.json`: the record a computation writes of what it computed,
 * with what, and whether its assertions held.
 *
 * @module schemas/computation-witness
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## Two schemas, because the corpus is not one shape
 *
 * The contract a witness producer is MEANT to meet was written down in
 * litlfred/qou's `schemas/witness-schema/js/index.ts` (and the TypeScript
 * interface `ComputationWitness` in `types.ts`). Measured over all of qou's
 * witnesses on 2026-10-04 (bean `qou-qb6t`), that contract accepts **1,685 of
 * 3,834** strict-JSON files (44 %), plus 5 that are not strict JSON at all:
 *
 * | divergence | witnesses |
 * |---|---|
 * | no `engine` | 517 |
 * | `engine` outside the 11-value enum (about 40 spellings) | most of the rest of the engine failures |
 * | no `assertions` list | 867 |
 * | `auditOnly` a boolean, where the contract says string | 144 |
 * | an assertion's `computed`/`expected` a boolean, list, object or null | ~2,600 values |
 *
 * So one schema would have to choose between describing what IS and what is
 * MEANT, and either choice makes it lie about the other half. Hence two:
 *
 * - {@link ComputationWitnessSchema} — the **envelope**: what every witness
 *   actually is. Every field optional and typed as the corpus types it, so a
 *   field that IS present cannot be the wrong shape. This is the kind's
 *   validator; a file it rejects is malformed, not merely unconventional.
 * - {@link ComputationWitnessConformanceSchema} — the **contract**: what a
 *   producer is meant to write. A file the envelope accepts and this rejects
 *   is a FINDING against its producer, reported by
 *   `scripts/witness-conformance.ts` and never repaired by editing the
 *   witness, which is generator output.
 *
 * Neither changes a witness. Owner hard rule on the qou migration: no
 * mathematics or physics content is changed, and a witness's numbers are
 * exactly that.
 *
 * ## No reliable `$schema` tag
 *
 * 22 of qou's witnesses carry a `$schema`, in seven spellings, and the rest
 * carry none. So the kind names one `validator` rather than per-tag
 * `nodeSchemas`, and a reader selects witnesses by the `.witness.json` suffix
 * the producers have always written ({@link WITNESS_SUFFIX}).
