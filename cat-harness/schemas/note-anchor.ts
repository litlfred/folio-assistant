/**
 * Where a note is attached, as a three-state answer.
 *
 * @module schemas/note-anchor
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## The state that did not exist
 *
 * `CarriedNoteSchema` already carries `targetLabel` — *"Block label this is
 * attached to, when it is attached to one"* — and it is live, not merely
 * declared: `test/sticky-todos.e2e.ts` exercises it across two pages and an
 * orphan label. **Attachment to a block already works.**
 *
 * What it cannot say is the difference between two things that are not the
 * same:
 *
 * | | meaning |
 * |---|---|
 * | **`block`** | attached to one block, named by its label |
 * | **`page`** | deliberately page-global — the owner's *"be global at top of page"* |
 * | **`none`** | attached to nothing, and nobody has said otherwise |
 *
 * With an optional string, `page` and `none` are both `undefined`. A sticky
 * somebody deliberately floated to the top of a page is indistinguishable from
 * one that fell off a block — and the second is a defect while the first is a
 * choice, so a tool that cannot tell them apart can only guess which to report.
 *
 * ## Page-global is an ABSENCE of block, not a reserved block id
 *
 * The obvious shortcut — a sentinel like `__page__` in `targetLabel` — puts a
 * value that is not a block label in a field that means "block label", so every
 * reader has to know the exception. It also collides the day somebody writes a
 * block with that label.
 *
 * The owner's own first consumer settles it: the landing page is to carry a
 * page-global sticky, **and the landing page has no block to point at.** There
 * is nothing for a sentinel to stand in for.
 *
 * ## Beans get NO anchor — a rule, not an omission
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-19: *"beans no anchor. no change bean schema. RULE."*
 *
 * This is a boundary rather than a shortcut, and it is worth saying why it
 * holds so nobody "finishes the job" later. A bean says **what is being worked
 * on**; a sticky says **where a note sits on a page**. The ask that reads like
 * it wants both anchored — *"same behaviour applies to beans"* — is answered
 * by the sentence right after it: *"beans can be used as an audit log of what
 * happened with agent as they moved through."* A bean records that a move
 * HAPPENED. It is not itself a thing pinned to a block.
 *
 * So a move is written to a bean as a **note**, which `workflow/bean-link.ts`
 * already does and which needs no new field. Giving a bean an `anchor` would
 * put a rendering position in the work plan, which is the same conflation
 * `schemas/theme.ts` refuses for themed todos — two stores with one vocabulary
 * is the drift this repository keeps paying for.
 *
 * Practically, too: a bean's front matter is written by a **third-party CLI**
 * this repo does not own, so a field added here is a field nothing guarantees
 * survives a round-trip.
 *
 * ## `targetLabel` stays
 *
 * This does not replace it. An anchor of kind `block` **is** a `targetLabel`
 * with its state made explicit, and `anchorOf` derives one from a note that has
 * only the old field — so every existing todo, and the e2e fixtures that
 * exercise them, keep working untouched. Read-forward, write-forward: new
 * writers set `anchor`, every reader can answer from either.

 * Content nodes a note is ALSO about, without being attached to them.

 *
 * The ask carried two features in one sentence — *"be attached to nothing or
 * show attachment to content node**s** based on relationships"*, plural — and
 * the owner settled which one it is:
 *
 * > **One primary + declared secondaries.**
 *

 * attached*, one place or none. Everything a consumer of `targetLabel` does
 * keeps working untouched, which was the point of choosing this over making
 * the block anchor a list.
 *
 * ## The badge counts PRIMARIES, and that is what keeps R6 true
 *
 * R6: *the badge's count SHALL be the cardinality of the query the panel
 * renders.* {@link notesAt} returns both sets from one pass so the count and
 * the panel cannot be computed from different things — and the badge is
 * `attached.length`, because the panel is *"the notes attached here"*. A badge
 * that silently included secondaries would be a number disagreeing with the
 * list under it, which is the exact defect the owner asked to design out.
 *
 * ## A secondary is a LINE, not an attachment
 *
 * What it buys on the board is the edge the ask asked for: a note placed at
 * its own position, with a line drawn to each node it is also about. It does
 * not move the note, it does not appear in that node's panel, and it does not
 * make the note belong anywhere.
