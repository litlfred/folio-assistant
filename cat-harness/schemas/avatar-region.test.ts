/**
 * `avatarRegion` — declared per image, square in pixels, and checkable.
 *
 * Bean `603s`, first slice. The navbar avatar is a theme's card art CLIPPED to
 * the cat, not the card scaled down, and the cat sits somewhere different in
 * every composition — so the box is authored data beside `textRegion` rather
 * than a literal in a stylesheet.
 *
 * Two of the first seven boxes landed on scenery rather than on the cat, and
 * only a render caught it. Nothing here can catch that; what it CAN catch is
 * the failure that is invisible in a render too — a box that is not square,
 * which stretches the subject by `w/h` rather than framing the wrong thing.
