/**
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * An image placed on a page of an ingested document — bean `d5f1`.
 *
 * ## Why a verdict is not enough
 *
 * The bean asks for a narrative description of every image. Measured on this
 * corpus 2026-09-20, that would be wrong six times out of seven: of 164 placed
 * images, **140 are page scans** — one near-full-bleed image per page, which is
 * the page itself, not a figure in it — against **24 candidate figures**.
 *
 * | document | pages | images | coverage | what they are |
 * |---|---|---|---|---|
 * | `WHO_PUB_TPS_93.1` | 121 | 121 | 0.998, one per page | page scans |
 * | `milnorlink` | 20 | 20 | 19 full-bleed | page scans |
 * | `9789241548960_eng` | 179 | 2 | ~0.50 | figures |
 * | `WPR-RDO-2020-003-eng` | 33 | 21 on 7 pages | median 0.013 | figures |
 *
 * So every entry carries a {@link ImageRole}. And it carries the **basis** for
 * that role, not only the role: `coverage` and `imagesOnPage` are the two
 * numbers the verdict was computed from, stored so the next reader can check
 * it rather than believe it.
 *
 * That is the `nso8` discipline, and this bean has already been burned by its
 * absence: `library/milnorlink/structure.json` carried a conclusion ("this PDF
 * carries no embedded outline") whose reason was false and unverifiable, and
 * it cost a full investigation under bean `8shg` before anyone could tell.
 *
 * ## The third state is `undetermined`, and it is not `scan`
 *
 * A role is only ever `page-scan` or `figure` when the geometry was actually
 * read. A backend that could not place an image yields `undetermined`, never a
 * default — an image wrongly filed as `page-scan` is silently dropped from
 * every description pass, which is the expensive direction to be wrong in.

/**
 * What an image IS, as distinct from what it depicts.
 *
 * - `page-scan` — the rendered page. Describing it produces "a scanned page".
 * - `figure` — content of the document: a chart, a table, a diagram.
 * - `chrome` — interface furniture placed by the CAPTURE rather than present in
 *   the document: a navigation icon, a copy button, a search glyph, a cookie
 *   control. Not content, and not describable — see {@link CaptureBasisSchema}.
 * - `logo` — an organisational or publisher mark. Furniture, not content.
 * - `decorative` — a photograph or ornament carrying no information the prose
 *   does not. Describable for accessibility, but not a figure of the document.
 * - `undetermined` — nothing could be determined. Never rendered as any other.
 *
 * ## Why `figure` alone was not enough
 *
 * Geometry gives exactly one bit: is this image the whole page, or something
 * on it. Measured 2026-09-20, the 24 images the geometric rule called
 * `figure` across this corpus were:
 *
 * | | |
 * |---|---|
 * | real data figures | **2** |
 * | organisation logos (JSTOR, MSF ×2, FAO ×2, UNDP ×2, ILO, WHO ×4) | **12** |
 * | photographs — 7 of them the same picture at seven sizes | **8** |
 * | unreplaced template text reading "SAMPLE TITLE" | **2** |
 *
 * Describing "every figure" would have produced twelve logo captions and
 * seven descriptions of one picture, against two about the document. No
 * measurement of the placed rectangle can tell a WHO emblem from a chart —
 * only looking can, which is why {@link InspectionBasisSchema} exists.

 * capture basis adds is evidence that is NOT a rectangle: a browser printed
 * this page, so the small images on it are the browser's own furniture.
 *
 * ## Why the producer string is evidence rather than a guess
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-21 across all 18 PDFs in this repository, the two fields
 * partition the corpus with no overlap in either direction:
 *
 * | class | producer | creator | n |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | browser print | `Skia/PDF m152` | `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh…)` | 11 |
 * | arXiv | `pikepdf 8.15.1` | `arXiv GenPDF (tex2pdf…)` | 3 |
 * | other | `(none)` ×2, `Atypon Systems`, `Pixel Translations` | — | 4 |
 *
 * BOTH are required by {@link isCapturePrint}, not either. Skia is Chromium's
 * graphics library and reaches well past printing — Android and Flutter emit
 * it too — so it alone says "a Chromium-family renderer", not "a browser
 * printed a web page". The user-agent in `creator` is what says the second
 * thing. Requiring both also fails SAFE: a capture missing one field is not a
 * rung, so its images stay `figure` and merely keep blocking, which is
 * today's behaviour rather than a silent reclassification.

/**
 * ONE PLACEMENT of an image on a page.
 *
 * ## Why this exists — bean `j820`, issue #1234
 *
 * `pdf-images.py` emitted one entry per PLACEMENT, so an image used many times
 * became many images. Measured 2026-09-24 across every `images.json` in the
 * tree: **383 placements of `arxiv-2510.21603v1` are 50 distinct images**, and
 * page 3's 335 are 22, each placed about fifteen times. `9789241509510-eng`
 * is 161 → 102, `9789241511766-eng` 99 → 44, `arxiv-2312.07755v1` 84 → 28.
 *
 * That was diagnosed first as a composite figure shattered into fragments, and
 * that reading was WRONG — the pieces are whole clip-art icons, placed
 * repeatedly. The correction is on `doc-researcher.md`, kept rather than
 * deleted, because it was a description asserted from file sizes instead of
 * from looking.
 *
 * ## The narrative splits in two, and the corpus said so before this did
 *
 * Collapsing duplicates looked destructive until the narratives were read. Of
 * 49 duplicate groups, 5 carried differing text — and every one differs the
 * same way. `9789240010567-eng` has seven byte-identical copies of the
 * Principles for Digital Development logo whose descriptions open with the
 * SAME clause verbatim and then each name the principle on their own page:
 *
 * > *"…used as a recurring header graphic for principle 8, 'Build for
 * > sustainability'."* / *"…for the principle 'Reuse and improve'."*
 *
 * So a description does two jobs: **what the image IS**, which is one fact and
 * belongs on the image, and **what THIS copy serves**, which is per placement
 * and is genuinely lost if the copies are merged. Hence {@link note}.
 *
 * It is also a QUALITY CHECK nothing else performs. `9789240081949-eng` has
 * five byte-identical QR codes described as if each encoded a different
 * category — one image, five incompatible claims. Byte-identical images with
 * materially different descriptions is a findable error class, and dedup is
 * what finds it.
