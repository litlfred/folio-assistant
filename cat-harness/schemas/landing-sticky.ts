/**
 * The landing page, as a board of sticky notes.
 *
 * @module schemas/landing-sticky
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * The owner's ask, 2026-09-20: *"i want the landing page to be a sticky note …
 * it creates an empty folio (if none exists) and attaches to the folio a sticky
 * note with grumpy cat background that adds content of the intiatized harness'
 * description"* — the description **and the four onboarding links**, confirmed
 * the same day. Then, refining it: *"each intiator should create its own
 * sticky."*
 *
 * ## The set is COMPOSED, not enumerated here
 *
 * This module shipped the board as a fixed set of three — `landingSticky()`,
 * `catHarnessSticky()`, `subgraphsSticky()` and a `LANDING_STICKY_IDS` constant
 * listing them. That was a list this repository owned, and the second ask
 * inverts the ownership. What is left here is the **node type and one
 * projection**: {@link stickyFromContribution} turns a layer's declared
 * {@link StickyContribution} into a sticky. The layers declare; this builds.
 *
 * Where each sticky comes from now, and why that file rather than this one, is in
 * `schemas/sticky-contribution.ts` — including why a declaration beats a code
 * registry (bootstrap holds no TypeScript and may not import the layer composed
 * on top of it) and why the text itself belongs in the declaration
 * (`AGENTS.md`: subject matter in this repository *"belongs in the folio as
 * data"*, and a sticky's words are subject matter).
 *
 * ## Why this is a note and not a todo
 *
 * `5oai` proposed the landing panel as a **`ThemedTodo`**, and that was the
 * right shape when the only themed thing was a sticky on a board. It is the
 * wrong one here: a landing description is not a task. It has no status to
 * advance, nothing to check off, and nobody completes it. Filing it in the
 * `todos` graph would put a page's furniture in the store that answers *what is
 * being worked on* — the same conflation the owner's *"beans no anchor"* rule
 * refuses one level over, and that `theme.ts` already refuses when it keeps
 * themes in the harness layer while their todos stay in `todos/`.
 *
 * So it extends {@link CarriedNoteSchema} directly — the general "note somebody
 * carries, attached to the graph" — which is what `TodoNodeSchema` also extends.
 * Everything that reads a carried note keeps working; nothing has to pretend
 * this is a unit of work.
 *
 * ## The anchor is NARROWED, not merely set
 *
 * `CarriedNote.anchor` is optional across three states. Here it is
 * `PageAnchorSchema` and required, because a landing sticky is **definitionally**
 * page-global: there is no block for it to sit on. `note-anchor.ts` was written
 * with this exact case as the argument that settled its design —
 *
 * > the landing page is to carry a page-global sticky, **and the landing page
 * > has no block to point at.** There is nothing for a sentinel to stand in for.
 *
 * Narrowing states that in the type rather than in a comment, so a landing
 * sticky carrying a block anchor does not parse. Leaving it optional would
 * admit the two states that cannot be true of this object and push the check
 * to whatever reads it.
 *
 * ## The geometry constraint DISSOLVES here, and that is worth knowing
 *
 * Bean `alox` measured the declared text region at **53% × 28% of the laptop
 * crop** — a few lines — with overflow *rendered rather than clipped*, which is
 * why the four onboarding links live below the panel today rather than in it.
 * That looks like a reason this object cannot carry them. It is not:
 *
 * > **A sticky note is not a thought cloud.**
 *
 * `textRegion` exists because the description is composited into the quiet
 * interior of the cat's thought-cloud, and that interior is a fixed shape in a
 * fixed crop. Once the landing page **is** the sticky, the sticky is the
 * container and the art is its background. A sticky sizes to its content.
 *
 * **So nothing here reads `textRegion`, deliberately.** Carrying it over would
 * reimpose the geometry the change removes, and the failure would be quiet —
 * words clipping or spilling against a box nobody meant to keep. The field stays
 * declared in `harness.json` for the old composited path and for any instance
 * that still wants it.
