/**
 * What a repository IS — the markers it carries, as a resolvable set.
 *
 * @module schemas/content-type
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## The question nothing could answer
 *
 * `getting-started.md` asked it like this:
 *
 * ```sh
 * test -f harness.config.json && echo isFolio=true
 * ```
 *
 * One filename, one boolean, and no type behind it. A repository cannot be two
 * things that way, and `smart-base` already is two — a DAK *and* a SUSHI
 * project — so the boolean is wrong about the first repository anybody asks it
 * about. Bean `79t3`.
 *
 * ## A repository is a SET, and the marker is the assertion
 *
 * **A repository declares itself an instance of a content type by carrying a
 * file named after that type.** The filename is the assertion; the type's IRI
 * is the resolvable reference to what the assertion MEANS. Several markers
 * coexist, so the answer is a set rather than a value, and each marker stays
 * owned by whoever defined it — `sushi-config.yaml` is SUSHI's and is
 * not ours to rename. `dak.config.json` IS ours (bean `cz17`), and was renamed
 * from `dak.json` on 2026-09-22 for consistency with `<name>.config.json`; the
 * claim that it was WHO's and unrenameable stood here until then.
 *
 * That is why this is a registry rather than an enum, and why each entry
 * carries its own `filename`: the owner's rule, 2026-09-20 —
 * **each type declares its own filename** — recorded in
 * `skills/folio-core/directory-conventions.md`.
 *
 * ## Deliberately the same shape as `GraphKindRegistry`
 *
 * Open, seeded with a base table, `register` refusing a conflicting redefinition
 * and tolerating an identical one (a diamond reaches the same type twice). A
 * layer that owns a type registers it at load time, exactly as
 * `folio-graph-kind.ts` registers `folio` rather than the harness declaring a
 * kind it cannot serve.
 *
 * A second registry shape would be a second set of rules about redefinition,
 * lookup and diamonds — all of which this one has already been through.
 *
 * ## Reported, never resolved
 *
 * Two markers may state the same fact differently — both naming a
 * `canonicalUrl`, say. {@link describeRepository} REPORTS the disagreement and
 * resolves nothing. That is `79t3` question 2, and the bean's own "Done when"
 * had already answered it: *"a disagreement between two markers **reported
 * rather than silently resolved**"*. Ranking the markers or letting ours win
 * would make one repository's truth depend on which layer happened to load.

/**
 * A content type a repository can assert it is an instance of.

 * `type` asserts membership of something un-dereferenceable, which is the

   * convention that claimed to cover the set would still be false on arrival —
   * one marker in the set belongs to somebody else — so there is no
   * convention, there is this field.
   *
   * ## A FUNCTION where the name is the instance's, not the type's
   *
   * `folio` was the one fixed name that stopped being fixed: a harness config
   * is `<instance>.config.json` as of 2026-09-20, so the marker's spelling is
   * a property of the repository rather than of the type. It still DECLARES
   * its filename — the owner's rule is untouched — it just declares how to
   * compute it. `undefined` from the function means "this repository has no
   * name to compose one from", which is not-a-member rather than an error.
   *
   * Every other type stays a plain string, because every other type really
   * does own its spelling.
