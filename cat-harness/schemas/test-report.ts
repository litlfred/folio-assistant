/**
 * A TEST REPORT — the verdicts one run of one plan reached against one system
 * under test. STRAWPERSON (bean `ygzh`, arc `3fva`).
 *
 * @module schemas/test-report
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * Proposal §3.2: *"`test-report/v1` has per-case verdicts plus a per-plan
 * rollup. It is written to `qa-reports` under `tests/<plan-id>/<sut>/<run-id>/`.
 * A signed certification is a separate node."* So this is a RECORD of what was
 * found, never the decision taken on it: certification is a Decision by an
 * accountable role, applying the DMN the plan's `exitCriteria` names.
 *
 * ## Per-case verdicts are the block-qa entry shape
 *
 * `{result, reviewer{kind,id,…}, reviewed_at}` — the shape `block-qa/v1` uses
 * for a criterion, with the same `result` spellings (`pass | fail | warn |
 * n/a`). Bean `py74` found `n/a` spelled `na` in one family and `n/a` in
 * another; a sixth spelling of not-applicable is the one thing this module
 * must not add. It adds ONE value, `skipped`, because a test process needs a
 * distinction QA does not: `n/a` says the case does not apply to this system,
 * `skipped` says it applies and was not executed — and §3.2's audit criterion
 * is that every case was *executed or explicitly skipped with a reason*. So a
 * `skipped` entry must carry its `reason`.
 *
 * Several entries per case are allowed, as in block-qa (a script verdict, then
 * a human override). The CURRENT verdict is the last entry.
 *
 * ## A rollup per plan, never a total across plans (`py74`)
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-21: *"Separate family panels, never one total."* A plan
 * is the test-side family: each one supplies its own criteria, and a pass on
 * `crdm-detect` case 4 is not the same kind of fact as a pass on a FHIR IG's
 * profile check. So:
 *
 * - a report names exactly ONE plan, and there is no field to name a second;
 * - the top level and the rollup are STRICT, so a `total` or `plans` key is
 *   refused rather than silently dropped;
 * - {@link rollupPanels}, the one aggregation offered, returns one panel per
 *   report grouped by plan and computes nothing that spans plans. Its test
 *   asserts the ABSENCE of a total, the discipline `QaGraphIndex` uses.
 *
 * ## Three things enforced structurally, mirroring `qa-report.ts`
 *
 * 1. **The rollup may not disagree with the cases it counts.** A count
 *    authored apart from the list it counts can lie about itself, invisibly.
 * 2. **`running` is never a pass.** `completed_at` is present exactly when the
 *    status is terminal, and {@link testReportVerdict} returns `unknown` for a
 *    running report even when every case so far passed.
 * 3. **The system under test never wrote its own verdict** (§3.2's last audit
 *    criterion). Decidable from the file — a reviewer whose `actor` or `id` is
 *    the SUT's actor — so it is refused here rather than left to a checker.
 *
 * What needs the PLAN as well as the report — that every plan case has a
 * verdict, and no verdict names a case the plan lacks — is
 * {@link checkAgainstPlan}, since a schema cannot read another file.
