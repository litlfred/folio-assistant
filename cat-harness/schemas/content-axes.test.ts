 * on 2026-09-22 — interactivity (O1) and visualiser (O2) — are declared in
 * two DIFFERENT layers, and these tests pin the properties that distinguish
 * all four rather than merely asserting their contents.

 * A test that only listed each tuple's members would pass on a repository
 * where every axis had silently become a synonym for the others.
