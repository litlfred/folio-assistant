/**
 * The todo graph — what `todos/` is, rather than where it happens to be.
 *
 * @module schemas/todo-graph
 *
 * Deliberately the same shape as `bean-graph.ts`, reusing
 * `ContentDirectorySchema` and the same open kind registry. A second spelling
 * of "a directory and what it holds" is the drift this repository keeps paying
 * for, so this file carries only what is SPECIFIC to the todo graph.
 *
 * ```jsonc
 *  // todos/todos.json
 * {
 *   "name": "my-folio",
 *   "directories": [
 *     { "id": "items",    "path": "items",    "graphs": ["todo-items"] },
 *     { "id": "feedback", "path": "feedback", "graphs": ["todo-feedback"] }
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## It is content, and the folio owns it
 *
 * This is the one real difference from the bean graph, and it decides who may
 * write here. `beans/` is the AGENT work plan and lives in every instance.
 * `todos/` records what **people** have outstanding, so it belongs to the
 * folio — the platform ships the kind and the schema and declares no directory
 * of its own. This repo carries no folio, and declaring an absent directory is
 * the bean `dh4f` defect, where a consumer scans nothing and reports a clean
 * run over it.
 *
 * ## Paths resolve against the graph root
 *
 * As in the bean graph: a node's `path` is relative to the directory holding
 * `todos.json`, so the whole graph relocates by moving one folder, and a path
 * that is absolute or escapes its root is rejected. A store outside the graph
 * is not a node of it.
 *
 * ## Three states
 *
 * - **Absent** → `undefined`. A folio with no todos has no graph file; this is
 *   ordinary, not an error, and not the same as an empty graph.
 * - **Present but unreadable** → **throws**. A graph nobody can parse leaves
 *   every consumer guessing.
 * - **Unknown node kind** → rejected, never accepted and ignored. A node whose
 *   kind nothing understands is a store nothing will read.

   * The theme a todo takes when it does not choose one — an id from `THEMES`.
   *
   * ## Why the DEFAULT is declared here rather than picked at render time
   *
   * Bean `5y4b`, and the owner's ask was *"todos need grump cat themeing based
   * on content too. used jugement"*. A theme chosen by keyword-matching a
   * summary in JavaScript is a rule nobody can see, review or override, and it
   * changes silently when somebody rewords a todo. So the theme is **data on
   * the todo**, and this is the value it falls back to.
   *
   * ## Why a DEFAULT at all, rather than requiring every todo to choose
   *
   * Because **a wrong theme is worse than no theme.** A plain card says
   * nothing; a card themed `operations` says *"this is operations work"* about
   * a todo that may be nothing of the sort. A default that is the instance's
   * own theme makes no claim — it says "this belongs to this folio" — so it is
   * safe to apply to everything, which is exactly what a clever guess is not.
   *
   * ## Why it lives on the GRAPH and not in the code
   *
   * A folio's own theme is the folio's to choose, and a literal in the
   * generator would be this repository's answer imposed on every downstream
   * instance. Absent means **no default**: a todo that chooses nothing renders
   * as a flat card, which is today's behaviour and a determined state rather
   * than a failure.

 * Two nodes rather than one, because the two already exist separately and the
 * difference is real: an `items` todo is raised about anything, while a
 * `feedback` todo is typically raised against a specific block and carries the
 * submitter's identity. Same split, and the same reasoning, as `bean-defs`
 * against `workflow-state`.
 *
 * **That difference is a filing convention, not a schema distinction, and the
 * wording above used to claim otherwise.** There is one `TodoNodeSchema`, and
 * the kind is a property of the DIRECTORY a note lives in rather than of the
 * note itself. Both halves of the description are merely *available* to both
 * kinds — the block anchor (`targetLabel`, and {@link NoteAnchorSchema} since
 * 2026-09-19) and `identities[]` are declared on `CarriedNoteSchema`, which
 * `TodoNodeSchema` extends. So nothing requires a `feedback` todo to name a
 * block or a submitter, and nothing stops an `items` todo from doing both.
 *
 * Saying so matters because the old wording was read as evidence that the
 * relation was *enforced*, and then, separately, as evidence that it did not
 * exist at all — bean `5oai` opened by asserting `schemas/todo.ts` "carries no
 * block field", having grepped that file and not the base it extends. A
 * comment that describes a convention in the voice of a constraint invites
 * both mistakes. If the distinction should be enforced, that is a refinement
 * on the node schema keyed by kind, and it does not exist today.
