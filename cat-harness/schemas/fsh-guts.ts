/**
 * A node of the trashcan — what `fsh-guts/` holds, and what may leave it.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-19: *"jsonld accessible via `<base-url>/fsh-guts.jsonld`."*
 * This is the shape that document serialises.
 *
 * ## The two properties that are not obvious from the shape
 *
 * **It is reachable BY NAME and never by an edge.** `UNPUBLISHED_GRAPH_TYPOLOGIES`
 * strips `fsh-guts` from every other published graph, so a consumer may fetch
 * this document deliberately and must never ARRIVE at it by following a link.
 * That is the owner's rule — *"references to fsh-guts stripped out of KG
 * before sending to publication"* — and it is why this is a separate
 * document rather than a subgraph of the main export.
 *
 * **Logs are inside `fsh-guts/` and must NOT be in it.** Owner, on the
 * activity log: *"dont get published"*. `fsh-guts/logs/` is git-ignored, so a
 * CI checkout happens not to contain any — which is luck, not a property.
 * {@link isFshGutsNode} therefore admits a file only if it DECLARES itself
 * `folio-fsh-guts/v1`, so a log entry is excluded because of what it says it
 * is, not because of where the build ran. Same contract the sweep uses when
 * it refuses to delete a non-log, pointed the other way.
