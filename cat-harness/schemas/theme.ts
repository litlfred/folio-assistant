/**
 * A sticky theme — named colour roles plus the three layouts, as a graph node.
 *
 * @module schemas/theme
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## Why a theme is a node and not a stylesheet
 *
 * The owner's ask, 2026-09-19: *"try to use named css assets in KG rather than
 * hardcoded colors so themeing is easier."* The reason that matters here is
 * measurable rather than aesthetic — `folio-assistant/docs/assets/css/docs-ui.css`
 * carried **106 hardcoded hex colours against 22 custom properties** when this
 * was written, so changing a theme meant a find-and-replace across the file.
 * That is how one state keeps the wrong shade: the hover, the dark-scheme
 * variant or the focus ring is missed, and nothing reports it.
 *
 * A theme declaring **named roles** fixes the failure rather than the symptom.
 * A rule says `var(--fa-sticky-surface)`; what that resolves to is the theme's
 * business. A rule naming `#8fa58b` has hardcoded a decision at the point of
 * use, where the next person cannot see the other twelve places that made the
 * same one.
 *
 * ## A theme lives in the harness layer, its todos do not
 *
 * The owner, confirming 2026-09-19: cat-harness is *"a layer/home of content"*.
 * So the **type and the themes** are harness-layer nodes, while the todos that
 * reference them stay in the `todos` graph. Moving todo content under the
 * knowledge graph to get it themed would conflate the work plan with the
 * knowledge graph — two stores with one vocabulary is the drift this repository
 * keeps paying for.
 *
 * ## All three layouts, or the theme is invalid
 *
 * The owner: *"themes need all three layouts to be defined to be considered
 * valid."* The three are `laptop`, `mobile` and `card`, which is not a new
 * vocabulary — it is exactly the set `harness.json`'s `images[].layout` already
 * uses, where each carries its own `textRegion` because the crop genuinely
 * differs.
 *
 * **Missing a layout is invalid, never degraded.** There is deliberately no
 * fallback to another layout's geometry: a theme that renders wrong on a phone
 * is worse than one that refuses to load, because the first ships and the
 * second is noticed. Same reason `resolveGraphKind` refuses an unknown kind
 * rather than guessing.
 *
 * ## One EXCEPTION, and it is a convention rather than a derivation
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20: *"each harness hould have its own unique theme (by
 * convention)"*, and then the assignment itself: *"cat-harness=gumpy hoddie.
 * test=engineer. bootstrap coming."*
 *
 * That does not reopen what the section below closes, and the difference is
 * exact:
 *
 * | | |
 * |---|---|
 * | **refused** | deriving a theme from a ROLE, process, skill or graph kind — a note's appearance would depend on which lane happened to be reading it |
 * | **this** | a HARNESS picking one theme and keeping it, written in that harness's own declaration |
 *
 * A harness is a fixed thing that owns its declaration, not a lane an actor
 * steps into, so "this harness looks like this" is a choice made once by an
 * author and recorded — which is what the rule below asks for. **Nothing
 * computes it**: `harness.json` still names an id, and no code maps a harness to
 * a theme. The convention lives in the declarations and in this comment.
 *
 * **A THEME IS REQUIRED; ART IS NOT.** The owner, 2026-09-20: *"who-voice-styess
 * and iris, will have its own theme (eaech harness gets one, but maybe not
 * avatar)"*. `backdrop` is already optional, so a palette-only theme is a
 * COMPLETE theme rather than an unfinished one — it names the harness's colours
 * and carries no cat. That is the right default for a layer whose art has not
 * been drawn, and it is not the same state as a theme whose backdrop is
 * declared but whose crops are missing, which `resolveThemeBackdrop` refuses
 * wholesale.
 *
 * Today: `grumpy-cyborg-agents` (the sage hoodie on a sled pulled by robot cats) is
 * cat-harness's, `grumpy-cat` (the plain sage hoodie) is folio-assist-core's,
 * `bootstrap` (the cowboy in the desert) is bootstrap's, and `engineer` is
 * reserved for testing surfaces.
 *
 * ## Choosing a theme is an AUTHORING judgement — there is no mapping
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20: *"no formal role/theme mapping per se. that is
 * authoring (human/agentic) decision/judgement."*
 *
 * So a theme is picked by whoever writes the note, and **nothing derives one**
 * from a role, a process, a skill or a graph kind. `ThemedTodoFields.theme` and
 * the landing sticky's required `theme` are the whole selection surface: an id,
 * set by an author.
 *
 * **This is a rule, not a gap**, and it is worth saying so because the absence
 * reads like one. It did to this agent twice: shipping the `library` and
 * `analyst` themes, I recorded that "no per-role, per-process or per-kind theme
 * SELECTION exists" and pointed at two beans as the mechanism that would supply
 * it. There is no such mechanism to supply.
 *
 * Three reasons the mapping would be wrong rather than merely absent:
 *
 * 1. **A role is a swimlane, not a property of a thing.** `role-model.md`:
 *    nothing *is* a reviewer; somebody *acts as* one for the duration of a lane,
 *    and the same actor is a different role in another diagram. A theme keyed on
 *    role would make one note's appearance depend on which process happened to
 *    be reading it.
 * 2. **It makes the choice unarguable and invisible.** With a table, "this one
 *    should look different" requires editing something that governs everything
 *    else; without one, it is a field on the note and the argument is local.
 * 3. **It is the conflation this file already refuses.** Themes live in the
 *    harness layer while the todos referencing them stay in `todos/`, and the
 *    owner's *"beans no anchor"* rule keeps a rendering position out of the work
 *    plan. A role→theme table would put presentation back into the role graph.
 *
 * The optional `theme` on {@link ThemedTodoFieldsSchema} already encodes this:
 * absent means *nobody has chosen*, which is a statement about an author rather
 * than about a lookup that failed.
 *
 * ## What the palette may NOT be asked to carry
 *
 * The sticky CSS already records the constraint, and a theme must not break it:
 *
 * > The priority stripe is the only per-card differentiator, and it is a WIDTH
 * > as well as an opacity — colour alone would carry the whole signal, which
 * > SC 1.4.1 forbids and a monochrome reader cannot see at all.
 *
 * So a theme sets the stripe's **hue**; it never sets its width to zero, and
 * {@link ThemeSchema} has no field with which to try. A theme is a palette and
 * a geometry, not a licence to remove a non-colour channel.

 * What KIND of surface a theme dresses.
 *
 * ## One node, not three, and the reason is the palette
 *
 * `schemas/theme.ts` exists because 106 hardcoded hex colours were replaced by
 * 22 named custom properties. Three separate theme node types would reintroduce
 * exactly that, one level up: three spellings of "accent colour", free to
 * disagree about what an accent IS. So the palette vocabulary is shared across
 * every kind and only the GEOMETRY varies — bean `j66n`, and the owner's
 * "one node with a kind discriminator rather than three node kinds".
 *
 * ## The geometry has to vary, and that was MEASURED rather than assumed
 *
 * A sticky theme's three layouts are `laptop | mobile | card`. The WHO
 * publication style guide (`wpr-rdo-2020-003-eng`, page 18, "Frequently used
 * formats and specs") states three PRINT formats instead — A4 21×29.7 cm, A5
 * 14.8×21 cm, A5 landscape 21×14.8 cm — and states **no** column widths and no
 * page margins anywhere in its 66 sections.
 *
 * So a publication theme cannot honestly fill `minWidth` ("before the grid
 * reflows"), and calling an A4 page a `laptop` would be a name that lies. The
 * requirement is untouched — three layouts, or invalid — and only their names
 * and fields follow the medium. Owner's ruling, 2026-09-20: *"Layouts vary by
 * kind; palette stays shared."*
 *
 * `webpage` shares the sticky geometry deliberately: both are screens, and
 * inventing a third viewport vocabulary for the same three breakpoints is the
 * duplication this file was written to end.

/**
 * Artwork behind a sticky's ink, named by the image ROLE it resolves from.
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-19: *"a note can hold the image as part of its theme."* So
 * the image is the **theme's**, not the note body's — a note references a theme
 * by id and gains the art for free, which is why the 2026-09-20 ask for a
 * *"sticky note with grumpy cat background"* needs no new field on the note.
 *
 * ## A ROLE, never a path — and this is the load-bearing decision
 *
 * The obvious version declares `src: "docs/assets/img/harness/landing-laptop.webp"`
 * on the theme. It was written first, and it is wrong, because **this module is
 * platform code that a downstream folio inherits.** `landing.html` already
 * states the consequence it was guarding against:
 *
 * > a downstream folio should not inherit a grumpy cat it did not choose.
 *
 * A literal path would give every folio depending on this platform a theme
 * pointing at three `.webp`s that exist only here — a guaranteed 404 in any
 * instance that did not happen to copy them, and the *same* defect class as
 * bean `blv9` (link-shaped values nothing checks resolve).
 *
 * Naming a role instead inverts it. The theme says *"my backdrop is whatever
 * this instance declares as its `landing` art"*; `harness.json` says what that
 * is. An instance with its own art gets its own; an instance with none gets no
 * backdrop and renders palette-only, which is an already-tested state rather
 * than a broken one. `5oai` resolved exactly this before the field existed:
 * *"reuse `images[].role` rather than invent an avatar vocabulary … a new
 * parallel field would be two spellings of one concept."*
 *
 * ## `scrim` is REQUIRED, and it is the accessibility mechanism
 *
 * Ink on a flat `surface` has a contrast ratio anybody can compute. **Ink over
 * a photograph does not** — it varies pixel to pixel, so no theme carrying art
 * can state its contrast, and a check over the palette alone would pass a
 * sticky that is unreadable across half of its own background.
 *
 * A scrim is what makes the question answerable again: it sits between art and
 * ink, so the ink's effective ground is the scrim over the art's worst case
 * rather than the art. Requiring it means a themed backdrop **cannot** be
 * declared without the thing that makes it legible — not optional, precisely
 * because "we will add a scrim later" is how the unreadable version ships.
 *
 * Same shape as the constraint this module already records for the priority
 * stripe: a theme may set a hue; it may never remove a non-colour channel.
