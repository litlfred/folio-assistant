/**
 * The direction counts are PINNED — bean `j79e`'s columns, `1xhc`'s gap.
 *
 * `wdir` and `undet` were added to the report on 2026-09-23, two days after
 * the owner ruled what the sidecar pins. Nobody went back, so for three days
 * `kg:detangle --check` compared nine fields and the two that answer "is the
 * layering inverted" were printed and dropped. In that window
 * `cat-harness/schemas/intake.ts` began importing `folio-assistant-core` and
 * the check stayed green, because the field it would have had to compare was
 * not in the file.
 *
 * These tests pin the FIELD LIST rather than a measurement. A test asserting
 * "wrongDirection is 1" would go red the day somebody fixes the edge, which
 * would teach the next agent to delete it. What must not regress is that the
 * number is recorded at all.
