  /**
   * Labels of **immediate EDITORIAL dependencies** — the blocks a
   * reader must already have in hand to follow this one. Rendered as
   * `\uses{}` in the LaTeX blueprint.
   *
   * ## This is the editorial relation, not the formal one
   *
   * `uses[]` answers an **expository** question: "what does a reader
   * need to have read first?" It is **agent/human maintained** — a
   * deliberate editorial judgement about narrative order, and part of
   * the authored content.
   *
   * It is NOT the formal dependency graph. The formal relation — what
   * a proof actually depends on — is **machine-derived** from the
   * `lean.ref` sibling declaration and its Lean dependencies. It is
   * never hand-written and never stored here.
   *
   * The two relations genuinely differ, in both directions:
   *
   * - A proof may formally invoke a lemma that needs no exposition
   *   (a `simp` set, a Mathlib instance). Formal edge, no editorial
   *   edge. That is correct and must not be "fixed".
   * - A block may depend editorially on a definition it never formally
   *   cites — motivation, notation, a worked example the argument
   *   reads against. Editorial edge, no formal edge. Also correct.
   *
   * **Do not populate `uses[]` from Lean.** Copying formal dependencies
   * in here destroys the editorial signal and inflates every ordering
   * metric that reads it. Tooling that surfaces formal-vs-editorial
   * divergence (`uses-formal-coverage`) is advisory only: it flags a
   * possible *exposition gap* for a human to judge, and never edits
   * `uses[]` or fails a build.
   *
   * Consumers that want the whole picture (impact analysis, blast
   * radius, triage ordering) take the **union** of both edge sets via
   * `content/pipeline/content-graph.ts` — see `ContentGraph`, where
   * every edge carries an `EdgeKind` provenance tag. Read that graph
   * rather than this field directly whenever the question is "what
   * breaks if this changes?" rather than "what must a reader read
   * first?".
   *
   * ## Form
   *
   * List only direct neighbors — not the full transitive chain.
   * If A→B and B→C, then A lists only B; C is derived by walking
   * the graph. Run `bun run pipeline/prune-transitive-deps.ts` to
   * enforce this. (Transitive pruning is sound on the editorial
   * relation, where reading-order is genuinely transitive; it is NOT
   * applied to formal edges.)
   *
   * Within the same paper: bare label (e.g. "def:quantum-universe").
   * Cross-paper (same folio): qualified "paper-dir:label"
   *   (e.g. "unital-groebner-bases:cor:pbw").
   * Cross-folio (external): full URL
   *   (e.g. "https://folio.example.org/papers/foo#def:bar").

  /**
   * Labels this block points DELIBERATELY forward to — a foreshadow, a
   * preview, or an explicitly deferred result the exposition promises to
   * return to (the surreal-number thread is the archetype).
   *
   * Where `uses[]` answers *"what must a reader have read first?"* and is
   * backward-looking by construction, this answers the complementary
   * question — *"what will the reader meet later, if they want more?"*
   *
   * ## Independent of `uses[]` (changed 2026-08-10)
   *
   * This field was originally a strict **subset** of `uses[]`: an annotation
   * marking one dependency edge as deliberately deferred. That could not
   * express the case it was most wanted for — a chapter overview (§0) naming
   * results it previews but does not depend on — because recording such a
   * pointer first required asserting a dependency that is not real.
   *
   * An entry may now be either:
   *
   * - **also in `uses[]`** — a genuine prerequisite the paper states later on
   *   purpose ("we will need X, proved in chapter 9"). The edge stays in the
   *   dependency graph; listing it here exempts it from the ordering-COST
   *   metrics only.
   * - **not in `uses[]`** — a pure forward pointer, asserting no dependency.
   *   It never enters the dependency graph at all.
   *
   * ## Zero cost, in both cases
   *
   * A foreshadow carries no ordering cost: it is skipped by
   * `detangler-no-forward-ref`, `detangler-graph-energy`, and both sides of
   * `detangler-block-tanglement`. Pointing a reader forward is a service, not
   * a tangle — the prose has told them the material is coming and does not ask
   * them to go now.
   *
   * ## Choosing between the two fields
   *
   * The exemption is from the ordering **cost**, not from the **edge**. A
   * foreshadow that is also in `uses[]` still counts for cycle detection,
   * dependency cones, chain depth, and PageRank — a cycle is a logical
   * impossibility rather than reader burden, so no declaration hides one.
   *
   * The authoring question is *"must the reader have this in hand to follow
   * the block?"* If yes it belongs in `uses[]`, and a forward-pointing
   * `uses[]` edge means the **block order is wrong** — the fix is the order,
   * not the field. If no, it belongs here.
   *
   * Getting that choice wrong costs reading-order accuracy, which is what
   * these fields are for; it does not affect whether anything is *true*. The
   * formal content of a block is carried by its `lean.ref` sibling and gated
   * by the Lean build, entirely independently of this graph.
   *
   * Each entry remains a claim that the prose actually frames the reference as
   * deferred. Everything not listed stays a finding.
   *
   * ## Form
   *
   * Same reference forms as `uses[]` — bare label within a paper,
   * `paper-dir:label` cross-paper, full URL cross-folio. Targets must resolve
   * (`foreshadows-resolve`), and a block may not foreshadow itself
   * (`foreshadows-not-self`). Unlike `uses[]`, this list is **not**
   * transitively pruned: pointers are individually chosen editorial gestures,
   * not a reachability relation.

   *    depth-first, looking for matching PO files in each dependency's
   *    `translations/<locale>/` directory

   * (no fallback). This is useful when a block needs translations from a

   * Each PO source is loaded in array order; later entries override earlier
   * ones for the same msgid, so the most specific source should be last.

 * than restating it.
 *
 * ## They used to restate it, and restating is how they kept losing fields
 *
 * Each was a standalone interface listing its own field set, and the set was
 * always a little behind. The record is in the field comments this change
 * replaces: `EquationBlock` was the only member of the `Block` union with
 * neither `uses` nor a base supplying it; `tags` was in the Zod schema and
 * not the type; then on 2026-08-24 `authorNotes` had to be granted to all
 * four by hand (bean `folio-assistant-5nle`), after qou #5115 found five
 * real author notes being discarded.
 *
 * That grant fixed the field it was about and left the mechanism in place.
 * Measured after it, `defines` was still absent from all four, and `cites`,
 * `simulator` and `computation` from three. A Zod object is non-strict, so
 * each of those was accepted at authoring time and silently stripped.
 *
 * `defines` is the one that bites: AGENTS.md §4c requires every glossary
 * term to be declared in `defines[]`, and the `defterm-declared` rule reads
 * that array — so a `table` or `prose` block introducing a term could not
 * declare it at all, and the omission looked like an authoring choice.
 *
 * The identical defect has a scar two hundred lines down: see `BLOCK_KINDS`,
 * where `algorithm` and `table` reached the union and never reached five
 * hand-maintained copies of it, excluding 461 qou blocks — 13% of the corpus
 * — from every sweep. Restating a set that already exists is the shared
 * cause, and `_blockKindsAreExhaustive` is the fix that was applied there.
 *
 * Extending is the same fix here: a field added to `BlockBase` now reaches
 * these four, and cannot be forgotten one at a time.
