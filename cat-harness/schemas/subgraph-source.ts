/**
 * WHERE A DECLARED SUBGRAPH GETS ITS CONTENT — one concept, several kinds.
 *
 * @module schemas/subgraph-source
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * The owner, 2026-10-03, verbatim:
 *
 * > *"It's the same pattern. One of them is mounting the directory while one
 * > of them is mounting a branch. Another mount type could come in the future.
 * > A sub graph declares where it's getting its content.. It could also be a
 * > graph database in the future. That same information can be overwritten by
 * > the harness instance config."*
 *
 * So a "declared directory subgraph" and a "declared branch subgraph" are not
 * two things. Both are a declared Subgraph; they differ in their SOURCE, and
 * the source is a discriminated union on `kind`:
 *
 * | kind | content comes from | the entry's `path` is |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `directory` (the default) | the checkout, at `path` | the content itself |
 * | `branch` | a declared repository branch, keyed by `commit` or `tip` | where a mount of it lands |
 * | `family` | a family of branches, one per key | where a mount of ONE member lands |
 * | `remote` | another repository's tree, at a pinned 40-character commit | where the remote mount lands |
 *
 * A third kind (a graph database) is a new MEMBER of the union — an additive
 * change every `switch` on `kind` is then forced by the compiler to answer —
 * never a reinterpretation of an existing field.
 *
 * ## How the older fields map onto it
 *
 * `storage: { branch, keyedBy }` (arc `3fva`, #1764; `keyedBy: "tip"` added by
 * #1937) is EXACTLY `source: { kind: "branch", branch, keyedBy }`. It stays
 * as the LEGACY spelling: the resolver reads it and reports the answer as
 * `declaredIn: "storage"`, the presence checks ask {@link contentIsOffCheckout}
 * (which honours both), and an entry carrying both is refused, because two
 * answers to one question is the defect this module exists to remove.
 * `qa-store.ts` and `branch-store.ts` still read `storage` directly; moving
 * them onto the resolver is their owners' change (#1957 takes `branch-store`'s
 * `mount`/`push` onto it), not this module's. The DECLARATION is the only
 * source of a branch's name (bean rva2, owner 2026-10-04: special-branches.json
 * leaves infrastructure). The resolver attaches no table row any more, and a
 * branch no directory declares is a health finding (`state:drift`), not a
 * resolver failure.
 *
 * ## Overridable by the instance config, matched on id
 *
 * `<instance>.config.json` → `subgraphSources: { "<dir-id>": <source> }`. The
 * declaration says what the subgraph IS; the config says how THIS
 * instantiation is set up, and where a subgraph is mounted from is that kind
 * of fact (an IG folio may mount `fsh-guts` from a branch while a fresh clone
 * reads it from the checkout). Matched on the entry's `id`, never its `path` —
 * the override rule `resolveDirectories` already applies to whole entries.
 *
 * ## One resolver
 *
 * {@link resolveSubgraphSource} is pure: entry + optional override in,
 * resolved source out. Every consumer — the KG export's Subgraph node, a
 * publisher's container node, `branch-store mount`/`push` — asks it, so the
 * precedence (config, then `source`, then legacy `storage`, then the
 * `directory` default) is stated once.

 * `Invalid option: expected one of "commit"|"tip"`, measured on
 * `main@12b916e9a5`. The declaration said yes and the resolver said no, about
 * one field, and nothing compared them.
 *
 * **Widening an enum is SILENT where widening the union is loud.** The union
 * below documents that "a new kind is a new member here and a compile error at
 * every consumer that has not decided what to do with it". A new VALUE gets no
 * such help: every consumer guarding `keyedBy !== "tip"` kept compiling and
 * silently took its else-arm. That is why this change is four consumers wide and
 * not one line.
 *
 * What each value means, and why `route` is not a synonym for `tip` (the
 * difference is whether a write carries `expect`), is in
 * `DirectoryStorageSchema`'s docblock — one place, because the meaning is one
 * fact even though the enum is now read in two.

 *

 * as a separate `z.literal("family")` arm of the storage schema — a second

 * ## `route-family`, and why its reasoning is HERE
 *
 * One entry per MEMBER of a family under a directory's path, the member
 * supplied at publish time rather than declared — the `STAGING/<slug>/`
 * previews on `gh-pages`, one per open branch. Bean `xp5j`.
 *
 * A fourth keying rather than a flag on `route`, because `route` must not carry
 * two write contracts for the same reason it is not a synonym for `tip`. Three
 * things differ, each a decision rather than a detail:
 *
 * 1. **The member key is UNTRUSTED** — it derives from a branch name, and
 *    `.github/workflows/feature-staging.yml` states a branch name is
 *    attacker-controlled on a fork PR. {@link RouteMemberSchema} is the
 *    validation.
 * 2. **Source and destination differ.** A declared `route` is published FROM
 *    the declared path; a family member is built into a local directory and
 *    published to a route named at publish time, so the two cannot be one field.
 * 3. **A member can be REMOVED.** `route`'s contract has no case for it — "a
 *    generator that stops emitting a page must stop publishing it" — but a
 *    member's branch can be deleted, and `feature-staging.yml` already deletes
 *    `STAGING/<slug>` on PR close.
 *
 * Like `route`, a `route-family` write carries NO `expect`: a member is a
 * rendering authored by nobody, so the newer generation wins.
 *
 * This text sits beside the enum rather than on
 * `DirectoryStorageSchema.keyedBy` in `cat-harness.ts`, and that is `1j3q`'s
 * rule applied to prose: the keying has ONE definition, so it gets one
 * description. It also keeps this branch out of a file `main` edits constantly
 * — the earlier arrangement put 67 lines there and `merge-main-bot` refused
 * every sweep on it.
