/**
 * A sticky is a CONTRIBUTION from a layer, declared by that layer.
 *
 * @module schemas/sticky-contribution
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * The owner's ask, 2026-09-20: *"each intiator should create its own sticky.
 * bootstrap sticky will have link back to the source code + ghpaghes for boot
 * strrap."*
 *
 * ## What this replaces, and why it is a change of shape
 *
 * `landing-sticky.ts` shipped the board as a **fixed set of three**, returned by
 * `landingStickies()`. That is a list this repository owns, and the ask inverts
 * the ownership: the set is **composed from the layers present** rather than
 * enumerated in one place. `folio-graph-kind.ts` already states the principle —
 * *a layer owns what it can serve, and the layer above does not enumerate it.*
 *
 * ## Why a DECLARATION and not a code registry
 *
 * The obvious design is `registerStickyContributor()`, matching
 * `registerFolioGraphKind`. It cannot work here, and the reason is the one that
 * motivates the whole change:
 *
 * | | code registry | declaration |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | bootstrap can contribute | **no** — `bootstrap/` holds no TypeScript, and `bootstrap/harness.json` declares an instance that *may not import from the layer composed on top of it* | yes |
 * | a downstream folio can contribute | only by shipping code | yes |
 * | inheritance | hand-wired | already resolved, `resolveDirectories`-style |
 * | expressiveness | arbitrary | the fields below, and no more |
 *
 * The first row settles it. CatBootstrap contributing its own sticky is the
 * requirement, and a registry it cannot call is not a seam it can reach. The
 * cost is the last row — a declaration needs a small vocabulary for *"my
 * description"* and *"the four onboarding links"* instead of running code — and
 * that cost is paid deliberately below, kept as small as it can be.
 *
 * It is also the more correct home for the words. `AGENTS.md`: *"If you are
 * about to write subject matter here … you are writing something that belongs in
 * the folio as data."* A sticky's text is subject matter, and it was living in
 * `schemas/`.
 *
 * ## WHEN a sticky is minted, and the RTFM link it must carry
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20: *"all sticky notes should be at end of initiation
 * process for that harnes and provife links to that harness's docs
 * (RTFM=...)"*.
 *
 * Two rules, and only one of them is fully structural today:
 *
 * 1. **A harness's sticky is its initiation's last act.** That is already true
 *    of the contribution — each layer declares its own card in its own
 *    `harness.json`, so nothing above it decides what it says. What is NOT yet
 *    split is the MINTING: `scripts/ensure-landing-sticky.ts` runs at the end of
 *    cat-harness's initiation and writes every layer's card, because pre-split
 *    (issue #223) cat-harness's initiation is the one that runs last and the
 *    only one with TypeScript to run. After the split each harness mints its own
 *    at the end of its own initiation, and `contributingRoots` already takes a
 *    LIST of roots rather than walking one, so that change is a caller change
 *    rather than a rewrite.
 *
 *    Stated rather than left to be inferred, because "bootstrap's card is
 *    written by cat-harness" looks like a layering violation until you know it
 *    is a pre-split accommodation with a named end.
 *
 * 2. **Every sticky links to ITS OWN harness's docs.** Not to the composing
 *    instance's — bootstrap's card points at `bootstrap/README.md` on the forge,
 *    because this site is cat-harness's and bootstrap has no site of its own
 *    yet. A card that sent a reader to the wrong layer's documentation would be
 *    worse than one with no link, since it looks like it worked.
 *
 * ## Why this module is HARNESS and not CORE
 *
 * `schemas/cat-harness.ts` is classified `agentic-harness` and
 * `schemas/landing-sticky.ts` is `folio-assist-core`. The declaration field that
 * carries these lives on `CatHarnessDeclarationSchema`, so defining the shape in
 * `landing-sticky.ts` would make the harness import core — a **wrong-direction
 * edge**, which `check:partition:edges` reports and which is the falsifier this
 * design was measured against. `repo-partition.ts` therefore classifies this
 * module `agentic-harness`, on the same test it applies to `note-anchor.ts` and
 * `front-matter.ts`: it is declaration vocabulary, it imports only `zod`, and it
 * carries no part of the content model.
 *
 * {@link StickyLinkSchema} moved here from `landing-sticky.ts` for that reason
 * and is re-exported there, so nothing that imported it has to change.

/**
 * One link a sticky offers.
 *
 * ## `href` must be site-root-relative or absolute — never bare-relative
 *
 * The one validation here that is about a defect rather than a shape. Bean
 * `blv9`'s entire subject is **link-shaped values that resolve by luck**, and it
 * carries seven instances. The site is a *project* Pages site with
 * `baseurl: /folio-assistant`, so:
 *
 * | form | what happens |
 * |---|---|
 * | `/guides/index.html` | correct — the template adds the baseurl with `relative_url` |
 * | `guides/index.html` | resolves against **whatever page is rendering**, and works only by position |
 * | `https://…` | correct — and must NOT be passed through `relative_url` |
 *
 * The middle form is the trap, and it was live in the file the sticky board
 * replaced: `docs/index.md` carried `[Install](installation.html)` written bare,
 * beside four siblings that went through `relative_url` properly. Those worked
 * because `index.md` declares `permalink: /`, which is *position-safe rather than
 * baseurl-safe*. Refusing the form here means a link moved into a sticky cannot
 * inherit that luck.
 *
 * `external` is DERIVED rather than declared, and the derivation is exact rather

 * How a sticky places and sizes its own words.

 * `landing-sticky.ts` said outright that **nothing reads `textRegion`** —
 * *"a sticky note is not a thought cloud"* — on the reasoning that once the
 * sticky IS the container, it should size to its content and a fixed interior
 * would reimpose geometry the change removed.
 *
 * The owner, 2026-09-20, having looked at one:
 *
 * > i want stickys to be the same fixd size … dispalyed content matches layout
 * > ratios. placemetn of markdown and scaling/size can be adjusted (in schema)
 * > to allow more control. default is centered in the various clouds positions
 * > of the default grump cloud (across three layouts)
 *
 * So a sticky is a **fixed shape** whose aspect is its crop's aspect, and the
 * words default into the cloud — which is what `textRegion` has always
 * measured, per layout, and which the three declared regions on the `landing`
 * role already give: laptop `0.33, 0.25, 0.53 × 0.28`; mobile
 * `0.13, 0.225, 0.72 × 0.225`; card `0.30, 0.255, 0.58 × 0.235`.
 *
 * **The old objection was real and is answered by `scale` rather than by
 * refusing the box.** Text that does not fit a fixed interior used to clip or
 * spill silently. A sticky that needs more room now says so — it shrinks its
 * words, or widens its box — and that is a visible authoring choice rather
 * than a quiet overflow.
