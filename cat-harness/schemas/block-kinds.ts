/**
 * The block kinds, as a runtime value — in a leaf module so anything can
 * read it.
 *
 * This list used to live in `types.ts`, which is where its consumers
 * mostly are. But `types.ts` imports schemas from `constraints.ts` at
 * module scope, so `constraints.ts` could not import back without a
 * runtime cycle — and its `appliesTo` arrays are built during module
 * initialisation, exactly when a cycle leaves the import undefined.
 *
 * That is why `constraints.ts` spelled its kind lists out by hand, and
 * why several of them ended up narrower than the rule they gated: a
 * kind missing from `appliesTo` is skipped by `validate.ts` without a
 * word. This module imports only leaves (the filesystem scan, the node
 * schema, and `types.ts` for a TYPE, which is erased), so there is no
 * reason for any list of kinds to be written out anywhere — and since bean
 * riit, step 2, none is: the kinds are DISCOVERED from the `block-kinds/`
 * graphs their owning harnesses declare.
 *
 * `types.ts` re-exports `BLOCK_KINDS` and `BlockKind`, so existing
 * importers are unaffected. The compile-time proof that a list and the
 * `Block` union cover each other is gone with the list: `BlockKind` IS
 * `Block["kind"]`, and the runtime half (every typed kind discovered, every
 * discovered kind typed) is `block-kind-nodes.test.ts`.
 *
 * @module schemas/block-kinds

/**
 * The **profiles** of the `paper` adapter's vocabulary.
 *
 * A profile is a *restriction* of one adapter's kind set, and is a different
 * axis from {@link CONTENT_ADAPTERS} — which is a disjoint partition of
 * namespaces. Getting those two confused is easy and costly, so the
 * distinction is worth stating plainly:
 *
 * | | adapter | profile |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | relation between members | disjoint | nested |
 * | a kind belongs to | exactly one | one or more |
 * | answers | "whose vocabulary is this word from?" | "may *this* folio use it?" |
 * | consumed by | QA criterion scoping ({@link adapterForKind}) | folio validation ({@link kindsOutsideProfile}) |
 *
 * `adapterForKind` therefore stays total and unambiguous: every kind below is
 * still a `paper` kind, and no QA criterion's scope changes because a profile
 * exists. A DAK kind is in no profile at all — it is a different adapter, not
 * a narrower paper.
 *
 * ## Why the split is where it is
 *
 * A *document* is the general case: policy guidance, a report, a standard, a
 * chapter of prose with tables and figures. A *paper* is that plus blocks
 * whose assertion is a formal mathematical claim, carried by a `.lean`
 * sibling. That is the whole difference — the tree of chapters and sections,
 * the `uses[]` editorial graph, QA sidecars, the HCI validation gate and the
 * publication pipeline are common to both, which is why they are one adapter
 * with two profiles rather than two adapters.
 *
 * The dividing line is machine-checkable at its sharpest point: `definition`
 * is the one kind whose `lean` field is **required** rather than optional
 * (`DefinitionBlock.lean: LeanRef` in `types.ts`), so a document folio cannot
 * contain one without failing schema validation. A test pins that, so the
 * partition cannot drift away from the type that motivates it.
 *
 * The theorem-like kinds join it for a reason that is editorial rather than
 * structural: their `lean` is optional, so a document *could* hold a
 * `theorem` with no formalization — but a theorem whose proof nothing checks
 * is the failure mode the paper profile exists to prevent, and offering the
 * kind in a folio with no Lean toolchain invites exactly that. `example`,
 * `remark`, `algorithm` and `proof`-free prose keep their optional `lean` and
 * stay in the document profile; a document folio simply never populates it,
 * which {@link DOCUMENT_FORBIDS_LEAN} states and validation enforces.

//
// Issue #764 §1 tabulates THREE axes and warns that conflating any two is the
// defect; the owner then settled a fourth on 2026-09-22 (O1). All four are
// declared here, together, because the thing a reader most needs is to see
// that they ARE different questions:
//
//   adapter        whose vocabulary is this word from?      DISJOINT
//   profile        may THIS folio use that word?            NESTED
//   visualiser     how is it shown, and what can be done?   NOT HERE
//   interactivity  is the content static or interactive?    CROSS-CUTTING
//
// THREE OF THE FOUR LIVE HERE, and the fourth's absence is the point rather
// than an oversight. `VISUALISER_KINDS` is declared in `cat-harness.ts`,
// because the owner's sentence is *"folio is the only visualizer provided by
// CAT-HARNESS"* — a visualiser is something the HARNESS provides, while an
// adapter, a profile and an interactivity are facts about CONTENT.
//
// `check:partition` is what settled it: this module is folio-assist-core and
// `cat-harness.ts` is agentic-harness, so the harness may not import the
// content vocabulary. The first draft put all four here and the gate refused
// the edge. Reading the refusal as a classification error rather than an
// obstacle is what produced the better placement.

// question and are not. Splitting these four across four files would make

 * FOURTH AXIS on 2026-09-22 (issue #764, O1).
 *
 * ## Why not a profile, which is what it looks like
 *
 * Profiles NEST and only ever narrow — `document` ⊃ `paper`, and
 * `profile-check.ts` rests on that. "A document plus interfaces" is a
 * WIDENING, so expressing it as a profile would mean breaking the invariant
 * every profile check is written against. It is not an adapter either:
 * adapters partition by VOCABULARY, and a webpage's words come from the same
 * vocabulary as a document's.
 *
 * ## `undetermined` is a VALUE, and that is the whole point
 *
 * The owner ruled in advance that the boundary is judgement. So the axis has
 * to be able to say **could not determine** — reported, never resolved to a
 * default — and a profile has nowhere to put that.
 *
 * It is a value rather than merely an absent field because ABSENT and
 * UNDETERMINED are different answers, the same distinction
 * {@link CatHarnessDeclaration.needs} already draws:
 *
 *   absent          nobody has said
 *   "undetermined"  somebody looked and could not decide
 *
 * Folding the second into the first loses exactly the fact the owner asked

 * could-not-determine as clean, which this repository forbids everywhere
 * else and forbids here for the same reason.
