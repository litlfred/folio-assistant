/**
 * The agent activity log — what an agent did, when, and in which process.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-19: *"an agent whenever it starts or ends a task or has a
 * log message, they should add an entry to a log entry in the trash […] by
 * default commit audit log to git data store is turned off."*
 *
 * Entries live under `fsh-guts/logs/`. That placement is the whole reason
 * they are safe to write freely: `fsh-guts` is stripped from every published
 * graph (`UNPUBLISHED_GRAPH_KINDS`, bean `folio-assistant-uv09`), so a log
 * cannot leak into the folio's linked data however verbose it gets.
 *
 * ## Persistence is OFF by default, and that is not the same as "no log"
 *
 * `fsh-guts/logs/` sits inside the repository, so writing there would be
 * committing unless something stops it. The default is **write locally,
 * ignored by git**: the agent can read back what it wrote this session, and
 * nothing reaches the data store until a workflow or the config asks for it.
 *
 * **The state must be reported, never assumed.** A logging system that
 * silently keeps nothing is worse than none, because the agent believes it
 * has an audit trail and acts accordingly. `LogCapture` is therefore a
 * three-valued answer rather than a boolean — see below.
 *
 * ## Why a schema at all
 *
 * The same contract every other store here uses: a directory says what to
 * EXPECT and the files declare what they ARE. Without `$schema` on the file,
 * a log entry would be told apart from a discarded proposal by its directory
 * alone, which is the "coincidence of the current layout, not a contract"
 * problem `#263` named and the bean and workflow stores already fixed.
 *
 * @module schemas/log-entry
 * @graphNode schema

 * would be the `dh4f` defect one level down: an instance that puts its
 * trashcan elsewhere gets a writer that creates a second one beside it and a
 * reader that reports a clean run over the real one.

 * What a log entry can POINT AT.

 * Owner, 2026-09-19: *"log should be rich schema including references to

 *
 * **The `etc.` is the specification, not a trailing-off.** A closed list would
 * be wrong within a week: the interesting thing to reference is whatever the
 * work touched, and nobody can enumerate that in advance. So `kind` is an
 * OPEN string with these as the known values, checked by a lint rather than
 * by the parser — a new kind must not require a schema change, a release and
 * a migration before an agent can record what it actually did.
 *
 * That openness is the same call `folio-fsh-guts/v1`'s `kind` makes, and for
 * the same reason: the trashcan does not get to be fussy about what is thrown
 * into it, and neither does a log.
 *
 * (`cmn` was read as **command**. There is no CMMN in this codebase — the
 * process standards here are BPMN and DMN — and "execution logs" pairs with a
 * command. If CMMN was meant, it arrives as `kind: "case"` with no schema
 * change, which is exactly what the open list is for.)
