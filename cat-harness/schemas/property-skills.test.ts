/**
 * The edit-skill map is TOTAL (issue #1146). Owner: *"it is a QA in and of

 * and so does a row naming a skill that does not exist.
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (resolves skills that
 * the content instances above cat-harness hold) live in
 * `test/property-skills-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it.
