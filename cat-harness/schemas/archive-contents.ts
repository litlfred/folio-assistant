/**
 * An archive's entry list, as data — bean `twqe`.
 *
 * A tar or zip in `uploads/` is opaque to every grep in the corpus: a search
 * for a filename inside one finds nothing, and that absence is
 * indistinguishable from the file not being there. `contents.jsonld` is the
 * listing that closes the gap, one shape whatever the container format, so a
 * consumer reads archives without knowing whether it was tar or zip.
 *
 * ## An archive entry is not a different kind of thing from a loose file
 *
 * `bytes`, `sha256`, `mtime`, `mimetype_sniffed`, `mimetype_source` are the
 * vocabulary `_tech_meta.py` defines for a file on disk (bean `nso8`), reused
 * verbatim. The mimetype is sniffed from the entry's OWN leading bytes and
 * never from its name, for the reason it is sniffed outside an archive too:
 * the name is a claim by whoever built the archive.
 *
 * ## Three entry states, not two
 *
 * A `directory` carries no size and no digest — it has neither, and a zero
 * would be a measurement nobody made. An entry that could not be read carries
 * `mimetype_source: "unreadable"`, which is NOT the same as an empty file, and
 * a `symlink` or `special` is listed with its kind rather than dropped:
 * silently omitting them makes the listing wrong, and an archive of empty
 * directories would become indistinguishable from an empty archive.
 *
 * @module schemas/archive-contents
 * @graphNode schema
