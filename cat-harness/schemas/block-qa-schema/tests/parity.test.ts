/**
 * The Zod half and the Pydantic half accept and reject the SAME documents.
 *
 * ## Why this is the test worth having
 *
 * This package's whole promise is in its own description: a *"cross-language
 * interchange schema"*. It ships three representations of one contract — the
 * canonical JSON Schema under `schema/`, Zod for TypeScript consumers, and
 * Pydantic for Python ones. A test that merely asked "does Zod work" would
 * pass forever while the two halves drifted apart, which is the only failure
 * that actually breaks the package.
 *
 * So every case here MIRRORS a case in `tests/test_python.py`, named for its
 * counterpart. If a behaviour is changed on one side and not the other, one of
 * the two suites goes red.
 *
 * ## What was here before
 *
 * Nothing. `package.json` declared `"test": "vitest run"` and vitest reported
 * *"No test files found, exiting with code 1"* — so the script had **never
 * passed**, and the only test in the package was the Python one, which CI does
 * not reach either (its job globs `cat-harness/scripts/tests/*.test.py`).
 * Bean `rsi6` found the package unbuildable; this is the half of it that was
 * scoped out at the time.
