/**
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * What was decided when a minted glossary term and an authorised terminology
 * DISAGREE. This is leg 1 of bean `2i5f`, under `5yhm`.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-02 (issue #1836): *"split: build leg 1 now as a skill + an
 * outcome schema."* The skill is
 * [`term-disagreement`](../skills/library/library-core/term-disagreement.md).
 * It says when a disagreement needs a decision and how to choose between the
 * outcomes. This file says what each outcome WRITES and WHERE, and refuses a
 * record that cannot be acted on.
 *
 * ## Which disagreement this is, and which it is not
 *
 * `2i5f` names two disagreements, and they stay apart:
 *
 * 1. **The extractor and the terminology disagree.** The corpus uses a word
 *    the authorised vocabulary spells differently, or does not carry at all.
 *    That is a CONTENT decision, and it is this file.
 * 2. **Two judges disagree about a mapping.** That is
 *    [`adjudication`](../skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/adjudication.md) plus
 *    [`untainted-verification`](../skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/untainted-verification.md),
 *    and it is NOT built. The owner's ruling keeps it waiting until
 *    something maps. Rejecting an automated match as wrong is a judgement
 *    about a mapping, so it belongs to leg 2 and has no outcome here.
 *
 * ## The subject: a DETERMINED disagreement, as the check reported it
 *
 * A record names the candidate `(scheme, term)`, the `target` it was checked
 * on, and the `exact` / `concept` pair `check:term-mapping` reported when the
 * decision was taken. Two pairs are disagreements:
 *
 * | observed | what it means |
 * |---|---|
 * | `exact: unmapped`, `concept: mapped` | the right concept under a label that is not its authorised one |
 * | `exact: unmapped`, `concept: unmapped` | the vocabulary carries no such label |
 *
 * `exact: mapped` is agreement, so there is nothing to decide. `undetermined`
 * is refused: a terminology that could not be reached has said nothing, and
 * deciding against its silence is bean `dh4f` in a new place. The observed
 * pair is kept so a reader can tell when the record has gone stale. When the
 * check later reports something different, the decision was taken against a
 * state that no longer holds.
 *
 * ## Three outcomes, each saying what is written and where
 *
 * {@link OUTCOME_WRITES} is the table, as data, so the skill and a test read
 * one copy. In short:
 *
 * - `change-prose`: the source asset is edited to the authorised label. The
 *   candidate is re-extracted, and the next check reports `exact: mapped`.
 * - `local-term`: an AUTHORED term is written to a glossary, with the reason
 *   the authority's concept does not serve. Where it is related to that
 *   concept, the term carries the SKOS mapping a person chose, so that
 *   mapping lands in the default graph rather than the automated one.
 * - `vocabulary-wrong`: nothing in the corpus changes. The record itself is
 *   the finding: this vocabulary is not authoritative for this domain.
 *
 * `local-term` may not use `exactMatch`. If the authority's concept IS the
 * term, the outcome is `change-prose`. A local term that is exactly somebody
 * else's concept is the duplicate `vocabulary-authority` exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## Where a record lives
 *
 * In a `*.term-adjudications.json` file beside the glossary schemes that
 * `check:term-mapping` reads. That check validates every such file and fails
 * on one that does not satisfy this schema. No file exists yet: a record is
 * written when somebody decides, never seeded.
