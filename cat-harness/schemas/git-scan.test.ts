/**
 * `xd1g` — the corpus rule, stated once so it is not re-implemented eleven
 * times.
 *
 * ## What `gitScan` has to get right, and the two ways it could be wrong
 *
 * It must EXCLUDE what git ignores — that is the defect. `ramz`: 145 ignored
 * documents counted as repository content. `biz4`: 233 nodes read as 1443 from
 * residue a clean `git status` cannot show.
 *
 * And it must LOSE NOTHING ELSE. A conversion that quietly narrowed the
 * pattern would look like a success — the count goes down, which is what was
 * wanted — while dropping real files. So every case below asserts the SET,
 * never the size.
 *
 * "check-source-licence's corpus, over this repository" reads THIS checkout's
 * corpus — every instance's `library/` — so it lives in the checkout's root
 * test home, as `test/git-scan-repo-root.test.ts` (owner, 2026-10-06:
 * "Throwaway repository, plus moving the real-repo checks"). The fixture
 * repositories above are what assert `gitScan`'s logic.
