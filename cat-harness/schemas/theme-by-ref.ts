/**
 * A theme by REFERENCE — `{instance?, themeId}` — resolved against the
 * instance that owns it, not only against the platform's own table.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/schemas/theme-by-ref
 * @graphNode none — a resolver over theme nodes declared elsewhere; it defines no schema of its own
 *
 * Bean `v8n5`. #1168 B8 (owner, 2026-09-30: *"migrate to ThemeRef"*) gave
 * every theme reference an `instance`, so *"a cross-instance theme now says
 * whose theme it is"* — and every consumer then went on reading `themeId`
 * alone and looking it up in {@link THEMES}, the platform's table. A who-iris
 * card citing `{instance: "who-iris", themeId: "iris-web"}` therefore resolved
 * to nothing, and the harness surfaces rendered on the avatar's hue instead of
 * the theme who-iris measured off its own sources.
 *
 * ## The platform finds an instance's themes; it never holds them
 *
 * `who-iris/themes/themes.ts` says why its palette is not in
 * `cat-harness/schemas/`: *"a palette read off a WHO style guide is subject
 * matter."* So nothing here names who-iris or copies a colour. The owner is
 * found by its declared `name`, its themes by the directory it declares with
 * graph typology `themes`, and the module there by one convention: a `themes.ts`
 * exporting `INSTANCE_THEMES`, already resolved. That is the same shape as
 * the tool groups — the harness loads a layer by what its declaration says,
 * rather than importing it, which is what keeps the harness able to build
 * alone.
 *
 * ## Absent is not the platform's
 *
 * A reference with no `instance` means the CITING instance's own
 * ({@link ThemeRefSchema}). The platform table is the answer only when the
 * owner is the platform itself or nobody is named — which is every reference
 * that existed before B8, so nothing that resolved yesterday stops resolving.
