/**
 * A tile's declared count, and the third state that is the whole point.
 *
 * Issue #856, bean `tis1`. The owner ruled for a badge over greying an empty
 * tile out, and their reason is the one these tests are shaped by: a badge
 * also makes a WRONG count visible, where a dimmed tile only ever answers
 * "empty or not".
 *
 * **The assertions that matter are the ones about ABSENCE.** A count that
 * renders is easy to test and hard to get wrong. The failure mode this design
 * exists to prevent is a reader that answers `0` for a question it could not
 * read — `dh4f`, scanning nothing and reporting it clean — and every such test
 * below is written so that a `?? 0` anywhere in the reader turns it red.
