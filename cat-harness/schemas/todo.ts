/**
 * A TODO — one human actor's work state, as a knowledge-graph node.
 *
 * @module schemas/todo
 *
 * ## What a todo is, and why it is content
 *
 * A todo records that a **person** has something outstanding. That is not the
 * agent work plan: `beans/` is the agent work plan, and `AGENTS.md` is emphatic
 * that no second store may be stood up beside it. A todo is the other thing
 * `AGENTS.md` already carves out beside beans — *"the content-review feedback
 * workflow … a separate domain feature, not the agent work-plan"* — and it is
 * **content**, authored and owned by the folio, not by the harness.
 *
 * ## It carries the four coordinates of the role model
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` states the model in one sentence, and every word of it is a
 * distinct declared object:
 *
 * > **An actor performs a task in a process as a role, using that role's skills.**
 *
 * A todo is a piece of that sentence left unfinished, so it is tagged by the
 * same four things: who ({@link ExternalIdentity}), acting as what
 * ({@link TodoTags.roles}), in which process ({@link TodoTags.processes}), on
 * which task ({@link TodoTags.tasks}). Tagging it any other way invents a
 * second vocabulary for facts the knowledge graph already names.
 *
 * ## A task reference carries its process
 *
 * A BPMN activity id is unique only **within** its process — `A_Implement`
 * names one thing in `crdm-requirements` and could name another anywhere else.
 * So {@link TaskRef} is a pair, never a bare string. The same lesson the
 * subprocess interpreter learned: a step id without its phase is not an
 * address, and resolving one by guessing is how a token lands in the wrong
 * diagram.
 *
 * ## An identity is provider-qualified
 *
 * `litlfred` is not an identity; `github:litlfred` is. A bare handle cannot be
 * compared across systems, and two providers' namespaces are free to collide.
 *
 * The link to a declared {@link ActorDefinition} is **optional on purpose**.
 * Somebody who comments on a pull request is a real person with a real
 * outstanding item whether or not `.claude/skills/actors/` has heard of them,
 * and refusing to record the todo until they are declared would lose exactly
 * the feedback that arrives from outside. `actor: undefined` means **not
 * linked**, which is a third state — never "anonymous", and never silently
 * resolved to a default actor.
 * @graphNode schema
