/**
 * The navbar icon row — WHICH icons, and whose answer it is.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-22, on where the list lives: *"should be in each harness
 * config which are shown (so some could show none, but make this default in
 * cat-harness that is inherited)."*
 *
 * That sentence names THREE states, and this file exists because two of them
 * look alike in every shape that gets written by accident:
 *
 * | declaration | means | resolves to |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | absent | *this instance has not decided* | whatever its `needs` chain, or the floor, decided |
 * | `[]` | *show none* — the owner asked for it by name | `[]`, and the walk STOPS |
 * | a list | *this instance's own answer* | that list |
 *
 * A guard written as `if (own)` collapses the middle row into the top one, and
 * the resulting page is indistinguishable from an un-migrated instance's. The
 * implementation guards on `!== undefined` for that reason; the tests below are
 * what stops it drifting back.
 *
 * The row shipped in #959 with NO test at either layer — a measurement taken
 * after the fact, not a suspicion — so this covers the resolver and
 * `navbar-row.e2e.ts` covers what the page does with its answer.
 *
 * @module schemas/navbar-icons.test
