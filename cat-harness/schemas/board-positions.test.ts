/**
 * The positions layer sits on top of notes, and its order is a function of its
 * contents.
 *
 * Bean `6lb8`, on the owner's ruling. Three properties carry the whole design
 * and each is easy to lose silently:
 *
 * - **the arrow runs one way** — a note knows nothing about a board;
 * - **the order is deterministic** — the mergeability the ruling rests on is
 *   worthless the moment a writer emits in iteration order;
 * - **one position per note per board is STRUCTURAL** — the owner's Q2 ruling
 *   of 2026-09-20. It was enforced by `place()` alone and asserted "through
 *   this path", which is exactly what a second writer, a hand edit or a merge
 *   walks around. The tests below now assert the type refuses it.
