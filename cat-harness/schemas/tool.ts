/**
 * What a Tool is.
 *
 * A **skill** states a capability generically; a **Tool** is one concrete way
 * to exercise it, and names the skills it satisfies. That separation is the
 * SOP in `skills/folio-core/skills-and-tools.md`; this is the schema that makes
 * it something a machine can check rather than a convention prose asserts.
 *
 * ## Authoritative, and the only authority
 *
 * Zod here, JSON Schema and JSON-LD generated from it — the carrier decision in
 * `skills/kg/kg-core/directory-conventions.md` §"What lives in the `schemas`
 * graph". The TypeScript type is `z.infer`, never declared alongside, because
 * two declarations of one shape drift and the drift is invisible until
 * something reads the stale one.
 *
 * ## Three constraints the strawperson did not have
 *
 * The version in `docs/architecture/cat-harness-minimum.md` flagged two
 * fields as too loose to build on. Both are tightened here, and a third
 * constraint fell out of writing the first real Tools.
 *
 * **1. `invoke` must offer an arm the harness can run.** `agentic-harness`
 * assumes no MCP server, so a Tool whose only invocation is `invoke.mcp` is not
 * usable by the layer that defines it — and would also make the MCP projector
 * emit a server that proxies itself. The refinement below rejects it at parse
 * time rather than leaving it to a reviewer.
 *
 * **2. `io.*.schema` is an absolute IRI**, not a bare string. A relative
 * reference resolves differently depending on where a consumer fetched the
 * Tool, so two consumers can disagree about what a tool accepts. Absolute or
 * nothing — the same rule `kg-export` follows for `@id` and
 * `harness-schema-export` for `$id`.
 *
 * **3. `satisfies` must be non-empty.** A Tool that satisfies no skill is a
 * mechanism nothing asks for. Whether the named skills *exist* is not something
 * a schema can know — that is `scripts/check-tools.ts`, which resolves them
 * against the real skill locations.
 *
 * @module schemas/tool
 * @graphNode schema

 * process (dependences = stall QA)"*. A downstream tool's failure was

 * ## Why this is not `maintains`
 *

 * artefact present" and "did the run that keeps this output current succeed
 * against the current inputs".

 * ## `judgedAt` — the third state, named
 *
 * `checkout`: the Tool writes a `folio-tool-run/v1` record and the audit
 * compares its input fingerprint with the current one. `published`: the output
 * exists only in an assembled site (the search index Jekyll writes), so from a

 *
 * Sharing a skill is not enough, and the declared field existed because of
 * that: measured 2026-09-20, most skills with several Tools have COMPLEMENTARY
 * ones — `workflow-start` and `workflow-next` are two steps of one skill, not
 * two ways to do one step. What separates them is the signature: steps take
 * and give different things. Measured 2026-09-30 over 118 Tools, the rule
 * recovers every pair that had been declared by hand and nothing else, once
 * three Tools whose inputs were typed more loosely than what they read were
 * given the precise type.
 *
 * An empty signature is excluded because it says nothing: two Tools that
 * declare no ports would otherwise be interchangeable by default.
 *
 * Symmetric by construction, so there is nothing to keep in step.
