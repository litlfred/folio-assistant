/**
 * A published static site, as a graph: what a CDN serves, at which routes.
 *
 * @module schemas/site
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * Two kinds, one per capability tier (owner, 2026-10-05, bean `lehh`):
 *
 * - **`basic-cdn-site`** — a CDN that serves files by path and nothing else:
 *   no MIME-type mapping, no redirects, no headers. GitHub Pages is one (its
 *   `gh-pages` Tool says so: *"Pages cannot serve server-side redirects or
 *   custom headers"*).
 * - **`cdn-site`** — the same, plus the three a real CDN adds. Declared now so
 *   a downstream instance's CDN deployment (beans `l9v6`, `xies`) has a kind to land in
 *   rather than widening this one later.
 *
 * ## A site is an archive with routes
 *
 * The owner: *"gh-pages is almost like an archive (e.g. zip, tgz) for which
 * we have a schema"*. So a site's files are {@link ArchiveEntrySchema}
 * entries, picked up rather than restated, and what a site adds over an
 * archive is the ROUTE layout: the release root, where staging previews sit,
 * and the per-instance sub-sites.
 *
 * ## Where a site comes from, and where it goes
 *
 * A site is `derived`: it is built from the renderable graphs its directory's
 * `derivedFrom` names, by a build Tool (locally, `site-build-local`; in CI,
 * `pages-publish` — two Tools, one skill), and put on its CDN by the Tool its
 * `storage.tool` names (`gh-pages`). Generators are code, not graphs, so the
 * build Tools are reached by the skill they satisfy, never by `derivedFrom`.
