/**
 * The headless PDF path WAITS for a client-built region, and REFUSES over one
 * that failed.
 *
 * ## Why this spec exists at all
 *
 * `skills/ui/ui-core/ui-accessibility.md` §"A rendering built client-side owes
 * two things the static one gave for free", owner 2026-10-02: *"print/pdf
 * needs to wait until loaded/rendered before printing"*, and *"a PDF is not
 * re-checkable after the fact the way a web page is"*.
 *
 * Interactive print cannot be made to wait — `beforeprint` is synchronous, a
 * `fetch` cannot be awaited inside it, and no browser lets a script hold the
 * print dialogue open. `docs-ui.css`'s `@media print` rules cover that case by
 * making a premature print say so on the paper. **So `scripts/dak-pdf.ts` is
 * the only place in this repository where the obligation is actually
 * enforceable**, which makes it the only place a claim about it can be
 * falsified. A refusal that nothing exercises is a refusal that silently stops
 * refusing.
 *
 * ## All four outcomes, because three of them look alike from outside
 *
 * | page state | what must happen |
 * |---|---|
 * | no `data-fa-render` at all | **emit** — the page declares no dynamic region, so there is nothing to wait for. `dak-pdf` assembles its own HTML today and is exactly this case. |
 * | `ready` | **emit** |
 * | `failed` | **refuse**, naming the attribute |
 * | still `pending` at the deadline | **refuse**, naming the timeout |
 *
 * The first row is the one a narrower test would get wrong. "Never asked" is a
 * third state, and a wait that treated an absent attribute as `pending` would
 * hang the current, correct caller for the full timeout and then refuse it.
 *
 * ## Why Playwright rather than a unit test with a fake page
 *
 * `waitForFunction` is Playwright's, and its behaviour on a document that
 * never changes is the thing under test. A stub that resolved or rejected on
 * command would be a test of the stub — and the attribute is read from a real
 * `document.documentElement`, which is the join between this script and
 * `kg-render.js`.
 *
 * `RENDER_WAIT_MS` is 30 s in production and that is deliberate (the cost of
 * waiting is seconds; the cost of not waiting is a PDF that looks finished and
 * is not). These tests therefore drive the timeout through the exported
 * constant's own mechanism rather than waiting 30 s: the `pending` case is
 * given a page that will never settle and the spec's own timeout budget is
 * what bounds it, so a regression that removed the wait entirely would fail
 * here by RESOLVING rather than by hanging.
