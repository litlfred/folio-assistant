/**
 * A scoped library viewer renders ITS SUBJECT's entries.
 *
 * ## Why this exists — the absence of it let a false finding stand
 *
 * Bean `yag0` reported `/cat-harness/library/who-iris/` as "a shell" holding
 * none of who-iris's three corpus entries. It was wrong, and it was wrong in a
 * way nothing could catch: the finding came from grepping the COMMITTED HTML
 * for the entry names, and this viewer is **client-rendered** — it fetches
 * `assets/library/index.json` at runtime and filters by
 * `inScope(x) { return !SCOPE || x.instance === SCOPE }`. The names are
 * necessarily absent from the static file whether the page works or not, so
 * that test could not have returned anything else.
 *
 * The inverse is the reason to keep this: a viewer that genuinely rendered
 * nothing — a broken `DATA_HREF`, a `SCOPE` that matches no `instance`, a 404
 * on the data — would pass every existing gate. `gen-library-viz.ts` exits
 * clean and reports the subject pages it wrote; writing a page is not the same
 * as that page having content, and nothing asserted the second.
 *
 * ## What it asserts, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * ## The expectations come from the DECLARATIONS, never from the viewer's data
 *
 * The first version of this test derived the subjects it checked from
 * `assets/library/index.json` — the viewer's own data. It passed against a
 * fixture with who-iris's entries deliberately removed, because deleting a
 * subject's entries also deleted the assertion about them: no key, no loop
 * iteration, green.
 *
 * That is the defect it is written against, one level up — a check that learns
 * its expectations from the artefact it audits reports a clean run over a loss.
 * So the subjects come from the repository: every instance declaring a
 * `library` graph whose directory actually holds entry directories. That list
 * cannot be emptied by the failure being looked for.
 *
 * `pageerror` and console errors are listened for, per `rendered-verification`
 * §"Listen for `pageerror`, or a crash reads as a missing feature": a viewer
 * that throws before rendering looks identical to one with nothing to show.
