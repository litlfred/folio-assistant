/**
 * A badge has THREE outcomes it can reach by fetching, and none of them may be
 * mistaken for a pass.
 *
 * The generated page used to carry the verdict: `gen-docs-pages.ts` wrote the
 * state class, the glyph and `"0 fail, 0 warn, 10 pass, 0 n/a"` straight into
 * `docs/*.md`. Bean `d2kp` measured what that costs — twelve pages stale on
 * `main`, one of them because the graph got BETTER, and a published page
 * telling readers a knowledge-graph check FAILED on `publication-workflow.md`
 * when it passed. A document carrying a measurement does not go stale loudly;
 * it goes stale by lying.
 *
 * So the page now says only what the corpus STRUCTURE says, and `docs-ui.js`
 * paints the verdict from the page's `qa-index.json`. This spec is about the
 * painting, and specifically about the three states it must keep apart:
 *
 *   - **determined** — a row with a verdict: `fail` / `warn` / `pass`;
 *   - **determined-empty** — swept, and every criterion came back `n/a`;
 *   - **could-not-determine** — the index would not load, or holds no row for
 *     this badge. Rendered `unknown`, never as either of the above.
 *
 * Two more are INERT, and since bean `4l4d` the index decides them too, not
 * the page: the committed page carries one uniform placeholder whatever the QA
 * corpus says, so that it is the same with `test/results/` fetched or absent.
 *
 *   - **not swept** — the key is in the index's `unswept` list: no sidecar,
 *     nobody has ruled. "Nobody checked" and "somebody checked and nothing
 *     applied" are different facts and this repo has paid for collapsing that
 *     kind of pair before;
 *   - **not available in this build** — the index says `corpus: "absent"`:
 *     the build had no QA results, so whether anything was swept is unknown.
 *
 * **The markup is the generator's own, lifted out of `docs/process/publication-workflow.md`.**
 * The verdicts are NOT the corpus's: `qa-badge-fixture.ts` sets them, and
 * throws by name if a node the spec addresses has left the page. A test whose
 * fixture is a live corpus verdict is the very defect this PR is about, and
 * `test/support/qa-fixture.ts` already records `main` going red once because
 * a content fix was correct.
