/**
 * The site index is FETCHED, and the page says whether it finished rendering.
 *
 * ## What changed, and what it bought
 *
 * `#fa-translation-index` was a `<script type="application/json">` island in
 * the `<head>` of every page. Measured 2026-10-02 on a local build of this
 * repository's docs site: **2356 pages carried it, 9482 B each, 22.34 MB in
 * total, and ONE distinct payload** (sha1 over the payloads). It is now
 * published once at `assets/harness/site.json` and fetched by `docs-ui.js`.
 *
 * `docs/concepts/architecture/folio-board-requirements.md` §R4 forbade that while it
 * required a rendering be "reachable without JavaScript"; the owner relaxed
 * that to "reachable without XSS" on 2026-10-02. The obligations the
 * relaxation came with are in
 * `skills/ui/ui-core/ui-accessibility.md` §"A rendering built client-side owes
 * two things the static one gave for free", and they are what most of this
 * file asserts.
 *
 * ## Why these tests and not a snapshot of the navbar
 *
 * `nav-locale.e2e.ts` already covers what the translation index DOES — which
 * nav items are swapped, in which locale, in both directions. It feeds the
 * ISLAND, and it still passes unchanged, which is itself one of the facts here
 * (the island wins where there is one, so nothing that carries one changed
 * behaviour). What is new and therefore untested is the TRANSPORT and the four
 * states it introduces, so that is what these assert:
 *
 *   - the fetch path produces the same result the island did;
 *   - the island still wins, so a fixture and a non-Jekyll page keep working;
 *   - a `translations: null` document is READ — a determined "no translation
 *     data", which must not look like a failure;
 *   - a fetch that FAILS says so, rather than rendering as "no translations";
 *   - a region that never registers is `failed`, not `ready` — the `dh4f`
 *     guard, falsified in the direction that matters;
 *   - a page that declares no region carries NO attribute, because "never
 *     asked" is a third state and not a value of the other two.
 *
 * ## `data-fa-render` is asserted on `<html>`, never inferred from a timing
 *
 * Every wait below is on the attribute. A test that waited a fixed number of
 * milliseconds would pass on a machine that was fast enough and would be
 * asserting the machine.
