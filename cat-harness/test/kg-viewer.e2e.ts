/**
 * Bean `tac5` asked whether a cross-tallied facet can hide a button that is
 * still filtering — the `l4zi` shape, *an action whose inverse is not
 * reachable is not a toggle*.
 *
 * **These assert the INVARIANT, not the defect**, because driving the page
 * could not produce the defect and reading the source says why: `kind` and
 * `sub` are written in exactly two places, both `onPick` handlers, and
 * `drawGroup` wires `onPick` only to buttons it rendered. A button exists only
 * for a non-zero tally, so every pick leaves the two selections with a
 * non-empty intersection — and a non-empty intersection is precisely the
 * condition for both buttons to be re-rendered.
 *
 * A test that reproduced nothing would be worth little; these pin the property
 * that makes the defect unreachable, so a future change that breaks the
 * invariant fails here rather than shipping the bean's scenario for real.
