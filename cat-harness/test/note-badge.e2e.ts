/**
 * A badge that can disagree with its own panel is the defect to design out.
 *
 * Bean `folio-assistant-1rta`, R5 + R6 of issue #602.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists when the behaviour was already right
 *
 * R6 — *the badge's count SHALL be the cardinality of the query the panel
 * renders* — was **already true** in `mountPageStickies` and protected by
 * nothing. It is a regression requirement: it needed a test, not an
 * implementation. The implementation moved one step further while this was
 * written, so the count is now read off the panel's own children and there is
 * no second number to go out of step.
 *
 * ## The trap this file is built to avoid
 *
 * *"A test that FAILS if the count is computed from anything but the rendered
 * set"* is not the same test as "the badge says 2 and the panel has 2 items".
 * The second passes for two independent computations that happen to agree, and
 * agreeing is what they do until the day they do not.
 *
 * So the fixture is built so that a DECOUPLED implementation would give a
 * different number:
 *
 * - `sec:one` has TWO attached notes and one SECONDARY (`alsoAbout`). A count
 *   over "notes mentioning this label" says 3; the panel renders 2.
 * - `sec:two` has a note that is attached here AND names itself in
 *   `alsoAbout`. A union says 2; the panel renders 1.
 * - `sec:three` has three attached notes and one secondary. A union says 4.
 *
 * A page with no secondaries at all would pass for an implementation that
 * counted them, which is why every block here has one.
