/**
 * The left-hand navbar shows the SELECTED locale, and nothing else.
 *
 * Reported by the owner, 2026-09-19:
 *
 *   "i have english selected, but i see the translated pages in LHS navbar.
 *    the fr/ ru/ etc. sub-dirs need to be explicitly labeled as translated
 *    content in the graph and not shown in navbar unless that locale is
 *    selected. (if not present, fall back to source language)"
 *
 * ## Why this is a harness page rather than the built site
 *
 * `_config.yml` uses `remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs`, UNPINNED and
 * fetched at build time, and the site cannot be built here. The same
 * limitation `docs-ui.js`'s own header states applies: these tests cover the
 * behaviour against the markup just-the-docs emits, reproduced here, and NOT
 * the integration with whatever that theme emits next month.
 *
 * What is NOT reproduced is the half of the fix that is not JavaScript:
 * `nav_exclude: true` keeps the translated pages out of the static nav in the
 * first place. That is Jekyll's to honour and is checked in the unit tests
 * instead (`content/pipeline/translation-index.test.ts`), which walk for pages
 * declaring a non-source `lang` and fail if any has stopped carrying it. A
 * harness that hand-writes the nav, as this one does, could "verify" that rule
 * by simply not putting the French item in — so it does not try.
 *
 * ## Geometry, not textContent
 *
 * `textContent` is DOM order and says nothing about what is on screen: an
 * element hidden by CSS still reports its text. Every visibility assertion
 * below is `toBeVisible()` or a `boundingBox()`, and every absence assertion
 * names the item it expects gone rather than counting what is left.

/**
 * A nav item with no translation in ANY locale — the fallback case.
 *
 * **This fixture was `getting-started`, and it did exactly what its own
 * docblock promised.** That note read: *"a real page of this site that has
 * never been translated. If it ever is, this test starts failing loudly rather
 * than silently verifying nothing, which is the correct direction to fail in."*
 * On 2026-09-26 bean `t8g3` translated it into six languages and the test
 * failed. The design was right; only the fixture had expired.
 *
 * ## What the illegible failure cost — TWO sessions, independently
 *
 * The failure surfaced as `element(s) not found` on a locator, which says
 * nothing about why. A sibling session paid *"three environments and a bisect
 * against `origin/main`"* to learn the page had simply been translated; this
 * one paid a full local e2e run and a comparison against main's latest CI.
 * Two people paying the same toll for the same missing sentence is the
 * argument for the assertion in the test below, not the docblock's word for
 * it — **main's copy of this file promises that sentence and its test body
 * does not contain one**, which is how a fix gets believed and not made.
 *
 * ## Derived, not named
 *
 * `HOME` and `GUIDE` above are looked up in the real index; this was the one
 * of the three still named by hand, which is why it is the one that rotted.
 * Two cases:
 *
 * 1. An indexed page carrying no translations. Preferred, because it is a page
 *    the generator has actually seen, and it self-heals: the moment such a page
 *    exists this stops depending on any name at all.
 * 2. When **every** indexed page is translated — true since `t8g3`, all seven
 *    of them — no such entry exists. The index only records pages that HAVE
 *    translations, so "untranslated" then means *absent from the index*, and
 *    the fixture is a real page of this site the index does not list.
 *
 * ## Case 2 is DERIVED now too, because naming it expired twice
 *
 * `architecture` was the hand-picked case-2 fixture, chosen over
 * `agentic-harness` on the reasoning that main's copy wins a merge. Bean `t8g3`
 * then translated **both** — batch 4 on 2026-09-26 — so the name rotted inside
 * the same day, for the third time in this fixture's life and the second for the
 * same reason. A fallback that has to be re-chosen every time the corpus grows
 * is not a fallback; it is a scheduled failure with a comment on it.
 *
 * So case 2 scans the site directory for a real page the index does not list:
 * top-level, carrying a `title:`, not `nav_exclude: true`, first in sorted order
 * so two runs agree. `index.md` is excluded because it IS indexed, under the
 * empty key, and only its filename says otherwise.
 *
 * And it THROWS rather than falling back when the corpus has no such page. That
 * state is real news — every page of the site translated — and it must not reach
 * the browser half as a locator that mysteriously misses, which is precisely the
 * illegible failure the two sessions above each paid for once.
