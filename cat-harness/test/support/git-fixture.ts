/**
 * A throwaway git repository with KNOWN facts, for a test of logic that reads git.
 *
 * ## Why a test needs one (owner, 2026-10-06: "Throwaway repository, plus moving
 * the real-repo checks")
 *
 * A dozen tests asked THIS checkout's git for the input to the function under
 * test — its `origin` remote, its `HEAD`, a remote-tracking ref — and so passed
 * only where the checkout happened to have them. Standing alone
 * (`check:cat-harness-standalone`), cat-harness is a fresh clone with no
 * `origin` and one commit, and every one of them failed on a missing input
 * rather than on a defect: a failure that looks exactly like a regression.
 *
 * The function under test was never about this checkout. Address derivation,
 * the upload-URL shape, a commit IRI, resolving a short sha: each is logic over
 * WHATEVER repository it is handed. So it is handed this one, whose every fact
 * is set here and therefore known, and the assertions stay exactly as strict.
 *
 * A check that THIS repository is configured right is the other case, and it
 * does not use this: it keeps its assertion verbatim and moves to the
 * checkout's declared test home, `test/` at the root (`kg-separation`).
 *
 * @module test/support/git-fixture
