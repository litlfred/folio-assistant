 * Make a temp directory a real INSTANCE, so its config is resolvable.

 *
 * The config filename is `<instance>.config.json` as of 2026-09-20, derived
 * from the `name` in the instance's own `harness.json`. A bare temp directory
 * has no declaration, so it has no name, so it has no config filename — and
 * `resolveHarnessConfigPath` correctly answers `undefined` rather than
 * guessing a global one back into existence.
 *
 * Twenty fixtures wrote a config into a directory that declared nothing.
 * Adding the declaration is the honest fix rather than the expedient one: a
 * directory pretending to be a configured instance ought to say that it is
 * one, which is this repository's own declaration-over-location rule applied
 * to its test material.
