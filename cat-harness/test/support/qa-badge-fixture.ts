/**
 * Derive a badge e2e fixture from the GENERATED page, without inheriting the
 * corpus's verdict.
 *
 * @module test/support/qa-badge-fixture
 *
 * ## Two rules, pulling in opposite directions
 *
 * **Shape is worth reading from disk.** A hand-written `<button class="fa-qa-badge …">`
 * can agree with `docs-ui.js` while `docs-ui.js` disagrees with what
 * `gen-docs-pages.ts` really emits — which is how a badge ships broken with a
 * green suite. So the markup here is lifted verbatim out of `docs/<page>.md`.
 *
 * **A verdict is not.** `test/support/qa-fixture.ts` already records what
 * happens otherwise: `qa-panel.e2e.ts` read a sidecar straight off disk, #302
 * correctly adjudicated the failure it asserted on, and `main` went red
 * because the CONTENT got better. That is bean `d2kp`'s own subject one level
 * down, and reintroducing it in the tests for the fix would be a poor joke.
 *
 * So: markup off disk, index rows set by the caller, and **throw by name** if
 * a node the spec addresses has left the page. Defaulting the other way is the
 * failure mode — every assertion downstream would silently test whichever
 * badge happened to be first.
