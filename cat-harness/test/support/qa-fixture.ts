/**
 * Derive an e2e fixture from a real QA sidecar, without inheriting its verdict.
 *
 * @module test/support/qa-fixture
 *
 * ## The failure this exists to stop
 *
 * `test/qa-panel.e2e.ts` read
 * `test/results/witnesses/crdm-methodology/what-is-not-built-yet.block.json` straight
 * off disk and asserted the panel's first row was a **failing**
 * `voice-status-leak`. Its header argued for exactly that — read the corpus,
 * so "nothing here can drift from what the generator produces".
 *
 * Then PR #302 adjudicated all 26 `voice-*` findings to zero. Correctly: the
 * block is titled "What is not built yet" and `**Not yet implemented:**` is
 * the heading over its inventory of gaps. The sidecar became 48 criteria with
 * no failure, the first row became the first alphabetical *passing* one, and
 * **`main` went red** — on a content change that was right.
 *
 * ## Shape is worth reading from disk. A verdict is not.
 *
 * The header's argument is sound about **shape**: a hand-made fixture can
 * agree with the code while the code disagrees with what the generator really
 * writes. It does not hold for **verdicts**. A verdict is content, content is
 * supposed to change, and a clean sweep is the QA system working. A gate that
 * goes red when the corpus gets cleaner punishes the thing it exists to
 * encourage.
 *
 * So: take the shape off disk, set the verdict under test, and **throw** if
 * the criterion named has left the file. Defaulting the other way is the
 * failure mode — every assertion downstream would silently test whichever row
 * sorted first instead, which is exactly what happened.
 *
 * `qa-panel.e2e.ts` had already reached this conclusion once, one fixture
 * down: `STALE_JSON` carries a comment recording that it *was* served from the
 * corpus, that re-running the sweep cleared it, and that rendering that state
 * "must not depend on the corpus happening to hold an out-of-date verdict on
 * the day the suite runs". Bean `folio-assistant-iumj`.
