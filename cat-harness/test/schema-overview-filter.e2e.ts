/**
 * The schema viewer's overview panel follows the filters — all of them.
 *
 * Bean `whbf`, the live-filtering item. Before this, `render()` honoured
 * search, kind and module while `diaModel()` honoured module ALONE, so a
 * reader who typed into the search box watched the list narrow and the
 * picture sit still. The bean records that as deliberate — the overview shows
 * SCOPE, not filter — and as a design that is defensible. As an *experience*
 * it is not, because nothing on the page said so, and an undisclosed
 * deliberate choice is indistinguishable from a bug to the person looking at
 * it.
 *
 * ## Why these assertions are over a rendered page rather than the generator
 *
 * The panel's whole behaviour lives inside a template literal as browser
 * JavaScript, so a unit test over `viewerHtml()` can pin that the WIRING is
 * present and cannot pin that it WORKS. This repository has already paid for
 * that distinction: `qttr` found 12 of 67 modules rendering their 10px font
 * at under 5px — the worst at 1.60px — and every gate was green across it,
 * because the generator's output looked right. Only a rendered page showed
 * it. The sibling unit tests in `schemas/viz-generators.test.ts` cover the
 * cheap half; this file covers the half that catches the `qttr` shape.
 *
 * ## What must not regress
 *
 * `whbf`'s closing line: *"a reader can return to the static arrangement, and
 * the undrawn-edge count survives every mode."* The second clause described a
 * mechanism that had been DELETED — `ovModel`'s intra-module counter went
 * with the ring when the layered diagram replaced it in `3f629d42b`, and
 * nothing replaced the contract. Live filtering restores it for the one loss
 * the current layout actually has: a relationship between two faded context
 * boxes, where both boxes are on screen and the line between them is not.
