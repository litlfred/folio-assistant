/**
 * The accessibility gate.
 *
 * Bean `gjli`: "ALL UI MUST FOLLOW ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES." A rule with no
 * check is an assertion, and the bean's own finding was that nothing here was
 * checkable — no a11y gate existed in this repository.
 *
 * ## Why axe alone is not the standard
 *
 * axe-core is necessary and it is not sufficient, and this suite exists in two
 * halves because of a measured fact rather than a principle.
 *
 * Baselined against the knowledge-graph viewer on 2026-09-19, axe found two
 * defects — insufficient colour contrast and undersized targets — and **none
 * of the four found by reading the markup against the rule**. The worst of
 * those four was a one-hop neighbourhood diagram whose every node was a bare
 * `<circle>` with a click handler: unreachable by keyboard, while the same
 * edges in the table beside it were fine.
 *
 * axe could not flag it. A `<circle>` with an `onclick` is not *recognised* as
 * interactive, so there is no control there to find a fault with. An automated
 * pass over a control the checker cannot see is not evidence about that
 * control.
 *
 * The complement holds too, which is the honest other half: making those nodes
 * real buttons introduced an ARIA contradiction — `role="img"` on the SVG,
 * which is a leaf in the accessibility tree, wrapped around focusable children
 * — and **axe caught that immediately** where a human reading the diff had
 * not. Neither half of this file replaces the other.
 *
 * ## Why the thresholds are above the floor
 *
 * This instance's declared interaction profile is low-dexterity
 * (`interaction/interaction.json`). WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 asks for 24x24 CSS pixels;
 * a target that is barely legal is a target that is hard to hit. The page aims
 * at 32px for list and facet rows and 28px for inline edge controls, and the
 * assertion below holds the 24px line so a regression is caught even if the
 * comfort margin is spent.
 *

 * other from a single declaration — measured at 5.97:1 light / 2.19:1 dark.
 * The sticky CSS is written as neutral overlays over `currentColor` precisely
 * so it cannot have that shape; this is what says so rather than assuming it.
 *
 * The board is checked OPEN and with a sticky PINNED, because a hidden region
 * has no contrast to measure and an empty float layer has no card in it. An
