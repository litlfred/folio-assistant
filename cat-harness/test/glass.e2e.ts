/**
 * THE GLASS — R25's pull-down folio, on a page that is not folio-assistant's.
 *
 * Owner: *"the user in visualization should be able to pull down their
 * folio"*, and *"pulling down folio panel = glass/window on which stikcy
 * notes/avatrs of materialized assets … are visualized."*
 *
 * ## The fixture is a REPLICA page, and that is the whole test
 *
 * `jpjt` measured the gap on `who-iris`: `docs-ui.js` 0, boards 0, tiles 0.
 * The cause was not that anything was broken but that the glass was created
 * INSIDE `mountTodoBoard`, behind two guards that belong to a board —
 * `fetchTodoIndex`'s `items === null` and `mountTodoBoard`'s `!main`. So the
 * folio existed only where a just-the-docs page had already put a `<main>`
 * and an index, and a reader browsing a library carried nothing.
 *
 * The page below therefore has **no `<main>`, no `.main-content`, no sidebar
 * header, and its todo index 404s** — every condition a `who-iris` replica
 * page meets. A fixture that kept any of them would be testing the board's
 * host, not the glass, and would pass just as happily with the defect in
 * place. That is the `check-invocation-parity` lesson: *a matcher proven only
 * against fixtures is proven against its author's idea of the file.*
