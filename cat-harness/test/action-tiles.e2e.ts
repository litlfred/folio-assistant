/**
 * The header's four buttons became one launcher over a grid of action tiles.
 *
 * Bean `1le7`, from the owner: *"that navbar is getting crowded. will need to
 * make expandable set of icon tiles that build out to the size of the QR code.
 * use that as kind of the template size for action icons, settins opens into
 * that tile with poppouts from there if neede, same for languages, smae for
 * this KG graph veiwer and src. light dark mode icon is tile under settings."*
 *
 * The motivating fact is that **the knowledge-graph viewer had no entry point
 * at all**: it publishes at `<base>/kg/` and nothing on the site linked to it.
 * Adding it, plus the source link, to a header row that already held four
 * buttons and the site title would have made the stated problem worse.
 *
 * ## What is asserted here, and why each of it
 *
 * The placement property — a panel not clipped by the theme's height-capped
 * header — belongs to `sidebar-panels.e2e.ts` and stays there. This file is
 * about the launcher itself: that every action is REACHABLE, that the two new
 * ones point where the site config says rather than at a hardcoded URL, and
 * that the whole thing is operable by someone who cannot use a mouse.
 *
 * The accessibility half is not decoration. This instance's declared
 * interaction profile is low-dexterity (`interaction/interaction.json`), and the
 * standing rule is `skills/ui/ui-core/ui-accessibility.md`. A tile that is
 * barely 24px is a tile that is hard to hit, so the floor is checked and the
 * page aims well above it.
