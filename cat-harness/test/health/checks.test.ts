/**
 * Every check is shown FIRING, not merely returning clean.
 *
 * **A checker that returns `[]` for everything passes a corpus test.** Run the
 * registry against a healthy repository and a function that does nothing is
 * indistinguishable from one that works, so "the live repo is green" proves
 * nothing about any of these. Each check therefore gets fixture evidence
 * chosen to breach each of its thresholds, and the assertion NAMES the finding
 * rather than counting them — a count passes when the wrong finding fires.
 *
 * The three states get the same treatment: a determined empty and a
 * could-not-determine are asserted separately, because collapsing them is the
 * defect the whole family exists to refuse.
 *
 * @module test/health/checks.test
 *
 * The tests here that read the aggregate repository's own root
 * (`.github/workflows/feature-staging.yml`) live in
 * `test/health-checks-workflows.test.ts` (bean
 * `ho66`): standing alone, cat-harness has no such root to read.
