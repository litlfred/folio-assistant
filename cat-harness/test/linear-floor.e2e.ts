/**
 * The tile listing is the artefact; the board is an overlay over it.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-21: *"this dymanic moving state is overlayed, its an 'extra'.
 * on stndard folio just simple tile based listing"*, and from the original
 * ask, *"but ALWAYS collapsable to linearly rendablee/just the docs."* Bean
 * `folio-assistant-0jtj`.
 *
 * ## What was actually wrong
 *
 * Measured on `main`, 2026-09-21: every note on an ordinary page was built by
 * `docs-ui.js` from a `fetch` of `assets/todos/index.json`. With JavaScript
 * off a reader got **nothing** — no note, no count, no hint that notes exist.
 * That is not a degraded board, it is an absent artefact, and it is why the
 * floor had to be built rather than merely asserted.
 *
 * ## Why these run against `renderTodoListing` rather than a fixture
 *
 * The bean asks for the assertion to be against the SERVED HTML rather than a
 * DOM the board built, and a hand-written fixture is neither: it can agree
 * with the test while the generator disagrees with both. So the page these
 * serve is the output of the same function `gen-docs-pages.ts` writes into
 * `_includes/generated/todo-listing.html`.
 *
 * **The limit, stated rather than hidden**: Jekyll still wraps that fragment
 * in a layout and resolves one Liquid `relative_url` call inside it. These
 * tests prove the listing is in the served bytes and readable without
 * JavaScript; they do not prove Jekyll's `baseurl` resolution, which is
 * `site-links.test.ts`'s job.
