  **What an actor may DO — may this party perform this action, here?** Use it
  when a grant or a refusal has to be written down so a machine can evaluate
  it: who holds an action, scoped to a process, a task or a role, and which
  broader action it falls under. It answers *permit*, *deny* or *nobody has
  said*. It does NOT answer who is involved in an activity (`raci`), which
  lane an actor may act in (`role-model`), or how a decision is reached
  (`kepner-tregoe`, `dmn`). It is not used here for source licences, which
  are recorded as SPDX ids in each library entry's `licence.json`.

# ODRL 2.2: permissions as rules over a declared action graph

**Adopted 2026-09-23** (issue #1180), on the owner's choice of permission
language: *"W3C ODRL 2.2 and W3C PROV-O for logging"* — quoted from the
docblock of `schemas/odrl.ts`. This node was written after the fact, against
the held Recommendation, so the platform's subset could be checked against the
standard rather than against its own description of it.

## Its sources: what is held, what is not

| source | held | what this node takes from it |
|---|---|---|
| ODRL Information Model 2.2 (W3C REC, 2018) | ✅ `library/w3c-2018-odrl-model-2-2` | the model, its classes and every MUST quoted below |
| ODRL Vocabulary & Expression 2.2 | ❌ not held | the Common Vocabulary actions (`display`, `modify`, …) and their `includedIn`; the JSON-LD context. **The `includedIn` values in `ODRL_ACTIONS` are not verified against it here** |
| post-REC errata | ❌ not held | none |

**A caution on section references.** The held sections were split by PDF
page, so a section file's body often begins with the tail of the previous
section. References below use the section numbers printed *in the text*, not
the file names.

## The load-bearing idea, in the standard's words

> "The ODRL Information Model represents Policies that express Permissions,
> Prohibitions and Duties related to the usage of Asset resources. The
> Information Model explicitly expresses what is allowed and what is not
> allowed by the Policy" — §2.

Its terms (§1.3): a **Policy** is *"A group of one or more Rules"*; an
**Action** *"An operation on an Asset"*; a **Permission** *"The ability to
exercise an Action over an Asset"*; a **Prohibition** *"The inability to
exercise an Action over an Asset"*; a **Duty** *"The obligation to exercise an
agreed Action"*; a **Party** *"An entity or a collection of entities that
undertake Roles in a Rule"*; a **Constraint** *"A boolean/logical expression
that refines an Action and Party/Asset collection or the conditions applicable
to a Rule"*.

Three mechanisms carry the method, and the platform uses all three:

- **Actions inherit through `includedIn`.** *"a Permission or Prohibition of an
  encompassing Action is inherited by all Actions with an includedIn
  relationship"*, and every action other than `use` and `transfer` *"MUST have
  one includedIn property value"* (§2.4).
- **Constraints conjoin.** *"When multiple Constraints apply to the same Rule
  ... they are interpreted as conjunction and all MUST be satisfied"* (§2.5).
- **Conflicts are resolved by a declared strategy:** *"perm: the Permissions
  MUST override the Prohibitions; prohibit: the Prohibitions MUST override the
  Permissions; invalid: the entire Policy MUST be void"* (§2.10).

And one that makes extension legitimate: a policy may *"Use an ODRL Profile
that declares the supported vocabulary"* (§2.1), and new actions are made by
creating *"an instance of an Action and define its includedIn parent Action"*
(§3.3).

## What this platform adopts — class by class

| ODRL | here | where |
|---|---|---|
| **Policy** (`Set`, `Offer`, `Agreement`), `uid`, `profile`, `inheritFrom`, `conflict` | adopted; both live policies are `Set`s with `conflict: odrl:prohibit` | `OdrlPolicySchema`, `policies/*.jsonld` |
| **Permission** | adopted: one rule per (actor, action), migrated from the old per-actor lists | `policies/folio-defaults.jsonld`, `policies/http-gateway.jsonld` |
| **Prohibition** | adopted in the schema and the evaluator; **no live policy states one** — both files' `prohibition` is `[]` or absent | `permits()` in `schemas/odrl.ts` |
| **Action** + `includedIn` | adopted: the folio profile's actions each name a broader action, ending at ODRL's `odrl:display`/`modify`/`annotate`/`derive`/`translate`/`execute` under `odrl:use` | `skills/permissions/permissions.json`, `ODRL_ACTIONS`, `broaderOrSelf()` |
| **Party** — `assignee`, `assigner` | adopted as the `assignee` of each rule, an actor id from `scenarios/actors/`, plus the profile party `cat-harness:anyone` for an unauthenticated reader | `OdrlRuleSchema`, `ANYONE` |
| **Asset** — `target` | adopted as an optional `target` string | `ruleApplies()` |
| **Constraint** | adopted for three profile `leftOperand`s — `cat-harness:process`, `cat-harness:task`, `cat-harness:role` — and four operators `eq`, `neq`, `isAnyOf`, `isNoneOf`, conjoined | `OdrlConstraintSchema`, `constraintHolds()` |
| **Profile** | `profile` is required; the action half of the profile is `permissions.json` | `OdrlPolicySchema` |

The evaluator is the question every caller asks — the BPMN task gate
(`src/workflow/authorize.ts`, action `perform-task`), the HTTP routes
(`src/core/rbac.ts`), and the `auth_whoami` tool (`src/tools/auth.ts`) — all
through `decide()`, over policies loaded by `src/core/access.ts`.

## What it refuses or departs from, with reasons

Each item is a place where the code differs from the held text. **They are
stated so nobody reads `@conformsTo w3c-odrl` as full conformance.**

1. **Duty, obligation, consequence, remedy — refused.** No reader exists, and
   `.strict()` rejects the keys *"because a rule that silently means less than
   it says is exactly the failure a permission file must not have"*
   (`schemas/odrl.ts`). A Permission carrying an unfulfilled duty would be read
   as unconditional, which is worse than refusing it.
2. **Refinements, AssetCollection, PartyCollection, LogicalConstraint,
   `rightOperandReference`, `dataType`, `unit`, `status`, `implies`, `partOf`,
   `hasPolicy`, `transfer` — refused**, for the same reason: no reader.
3. **`target` is optional; ODRL requires it.** §2.6.1: *"A Permission MUST
   have one target property value of type Asset"* (Prohibition likewise,
   §2.6.2). Here an absent target means the instance's whole graph. Every live
   rule omits it.
4. **The default conflict strategy is `prohibit`; ODRL's is `invalid`.** §2.10:
   *"If the conflict property is not explicitly set, the default of invalid
   will be used."* The code names this as *"OUR rule rather than claimed as
   ODRL's"*; both live policies set `odrl:prohibit` explicitly, so the
   difference does not fire today. **Kept by owner ruling, 2026-10-01**
   (bean `jcet`): an unstated clash denies rather than voiding the policy —
   a deliberate profile departure, not an oversight; `odrl.test.ts` pins it.
5. **Across policies, any `deny` wins.** `decide()` evaluates each policy and
   lets a prohibition in one beat a permission in another. ODRL's merge rule
   is different — inherited conflict values are replicated and *"If a Policy
   has multiple conflict property values ... then the entire Policy MUST be
   void"* (§2.10). Only the child's `conflict` is read by `permits()`.
6. **A circular `inheritFrom` is tolerated, not refused.** §2.9: *"Inheritance
   MUST NOT be circular."* `effectiveRules()` walks with a visited set, so a
   cycle terminates silently instead of failing. (Cycles *are* deliberately
   allowed in the **action** graph — the owner's *"doensnt necc need to be
   rooted acyclic graph"*. That sits uneasily with §2.4, which calls
   `includedIn` transitive, says *"the Actions form ancestor relationships"*,
   and requires every action to reach `use` or `transfer`; a cycle among
   profile actions is a departure, not a reading.)
7. **No-match answers `unknown`, a third value.** This node found no held text
   that defines the outcome when no rule matches; `unknown` — never permit,
   never deny — is the platform's rule (`Decision` in `schemas/odrl.ts`), so
   `task-authorization` can report it as a finding.
8. **Role eligibility is added on top.** `permits()` denies a permitted request
   whose `cat-harness:role` the actor is not eligible for. That is
   `role-model`'s separation of what a lane needs from what an actor may do;
   it is not ODRL.
9. **Cardinalities not enforced:** an empty policy validates (§2.1: *"MUST have
   at least one permission, prohibition, or obligation"*); an `Offer` needs no
   `assigner` and an `Agreement` needs no policy-level `assignee` (§2.1.2,
   §2.1.3); and the profile IRI is never checked, although §3.2 says a
   processor that *"does not recognise the ODRL Profile identifier(s) ... MUST
   stop processing"*.
10. **The profile is not published as RDF.** §3.3 asks that new terms *"must
    also be defined as a skos:Concept"*; `permissions.json` is plain JSON with
    `id`, `title`, `description`, `includedIn`, and the profile IRI
    `https://litlfred.github.io/folio-assistant/ns/folio-odrl` is not shown to
    resolve.

## What ODRL is not used for here

- **Not for source licences.** ODRL's own subject is content usage, and the
  natural reading would be a library entry's licence as an ODRL Offer. That is
  not what happens: `licence.json` records a `status` and an SPDX `id`, checked
  by `bun run check:source-licence` (`scripts/check-source-licence.ts`).
- **Not for identity.** Which login is which actor is GitHub's answer
  (`src/core/github-auth.ts`), never a policy's — `policies/README.md`.
- **Not for logging.** That is PROV-O (`schemas/prov.ts`), chosen alongside it.

## Where it runs

Schema and evaluator `schemas/odrl.ts` (tests `schemas/odrl.test.ts`);
policies `policies/` (graph typology `policies`, validator registered in
`schemas/graph-typology-registry.ts`); the action profile
`skills/permissions/permissions.json`; external-schema entry
`external-schemas/w3c-odrl.json`; the design
`docs/proposals/odrl-prov-actor-model.md`. How it is applied — actors,
permissions and lanes — is in
[`role-model`](../skills/process/process-core/role-model.md) and
[`task-authorization`](../skills/process/process-core/task-authorization.md);
this node is the method, and those skills name it rather than restate it.
