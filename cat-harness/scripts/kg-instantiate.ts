/**
 * INSTANTIATE a harness a subscription chose: write `<harness>.config.json` at
 * the instantiation root, and the state directories the harness declares, so
 * the harness reaches the navbar.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/kg-instantiate
 * @covers cat-harness, substrate-snapshot
 *
 * Issue #1719, epic bean `fnx4`, slice 7 of
 * `docs/proposals/kg-subscriptions.md` — the third verb, after subscribe
 * (slice 4, `kg-subscribe.ts`) and materialise (slices 5–6).
 *
 * ## What it reads, and why nothing is fetched
 *
 * The harness's declaration is the substrate snapshot `kg:subscribe` cached at
 * the subscription's pin. Instantiating reads that snapshot and nothing else:
 * the pin was judged once, its bytes carry a digest, and reading the network
 * again here would be a second, unpinned answer to "what does this harness
 * declare". So a missing or edited snapshot is refused rather than refetched.
 *
 * ## The refusals, each with its reason
 *
 * - **not chosen**: the harness is not in the subscription's `harnesses`.
 *   Choosing is the subscriber's act, recorded in the declaration; instantiating
 *   something unchosen would put a harness in the navbar that no declaration
 *   asked for.
 * - **not declared**: the snapshot does not list it among the substrate's
 *   harnesses at the pin.
 * - **a need unmet**: every name in the harness's `needs` must be an instance
 *   in this checkout, or a substrate some subscription here holds the snapshot
 *   of. The missing ones are named.
 * - **a name taken**: a local instance already carries the harness's name. Two
 *   declarations under one name is the ambiguity `disambiguate` reports, and
 *   the config file would bind to the wrong one.
 *
 * ## Three answers, never two
 *
 * `could-not-determine` is its own result and is never clean: a snapshot that
 * is absent or will not parse, an unreadable declaration in the checkout while
 * a need is still unresolved, or a directory whose graph typologies this registry
 * does not know, so whether it is a STATE directory cannot be said. Creating
 * it might write a directory the harness's processes never use; skipping it
 * might leave out one they write. Either guess is `dh4f`, so the run stops and
 * names the kinds to register.
 *
 * ## Where the state directories go
 *
 * Under `<instantiation root>/<harness>/`, at each directory's declared path,
 * with a `.gitkeep` so an empty directory survives a commit. The harness has no
 * local declaration (its declaration is the snapshot, on purpose: see
 * `schemas/substrate-snapshot.ts`), so `<harness>/` is where its local bytes
 * live; no scanner reads it as an instance because it carries no declaration.
 *
 * ## Idempotent, and the config is never overwritten
 *
 * State directories are written first and the config last, so a config on disk
 * means the directories were made. A run that finds the config reports it as
 * already instantiated and leaves it byte for byte; it still creates any state
 * directory that has gone missing, which is the one thing a re-run can repair
 * without overwriting anything.
 *
 * ## How it reaches the navbar
 *
 * `harness-tiles.ts` draws a tile for every chosen harness whose config sits
 * at the root and that no local instance names, from its snapshot
 * (`subscribedTile` in `subscribed-harnesses.ts`); `check-instance-config.ts` counts a chosen
 * harness's config as claimed rather than orphaned. Run `bun run
 * docs:harness` afterwards to regenerate `docs/_data/harness.json`.
 *
 * `check:instance-render` judges instances that have a local tree to render.
 * A subscribed harness has none until its subgraphs are materialised, so that
 * gate says nothing about it yet: a limit, reported here rather than implied.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run kg:instantiate <subscription-id> <harness> [--instance <dir>] [--dry-run]
