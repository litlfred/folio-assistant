/**
 * The merge queue's ORDER, as a command — the entry point `merge-queue.ts`
 * was written for and never got.
 *
 * `merge-queue.ts` derives each candidate's facts, evaluates
 * `processes/sdlc/decisions/merge-priority.dmn` and orders the result. Its own
 * docblock calls it "a library the merge steward and the tile call". Measured
 * 2026-10-04: **nothing called it.** It is wired to no `package.json` script,
 * so the ordering a declared decision table exists to give could not be asked
 * for, and a steward ordered the queue by hand instead — clean-and-green in PR
 * number order, which is not any of the table's four inputs.
 *
 * That is the defect this file closes, and it is worth naming as a class: a
 * decision table with no caller is indistinguishable, from outside, from a
 * decision nobody takes. The table was not wrong; it was unreachable.
 *
 * This command READS and prints. It merges nothing and writes no queue entry,
 * because `merge-queue.ts` is explicit that what the steward acts on is
 * recorded by the steward and the facts stay GitHub's.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run merge:steward              # the ordered queue, as a table
 *   bun run merge:steward --json       # the same, machine-readable
 *   bun run merge:steward --base <ref> # order against a ref other than origin/main
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/merge-steward
 * @covers none — a steward's reader over GitHub and the bean store; it judges no declared graph
