/**
 * Which sessions have been working this repository, and where each one got to.
 *
 * Bean `ab3n`, measured 2026-09-20: **eight sibling sessions committed in one
 * four-hour window**, and the session API returned *not found* for all eight
 * lookups by id; its listing showed only the asking session. Nothing in
 * `AGENTS.md`, `bean-coordination` or `session-intent` said how to enumerate
 * the sessions working a repository — while *"watch all open PRs for incoming
 * insights"* and *"claim before you work"* both assume an agent can see who
 * else is here.
 *
 * ## That observation is DATED, and this tool is not the first resort
 *
 * **Re-measured 2026-09-21: the listing returned seven siblings**, with their
 * statuses and — for those waiting — the question each was holding, in plain
 * text. So *"the session API cannot see a sibling"*, which this file printed in
 * its own report until then, is a present-tense claim that had stopped being
 * true, and it is exactly what bean `8nzu` is about: a dated observation
 * welded to a capability claim outlives its evidence, and every reader after
 * that takes the claim.
 *
 * What is durable is narrower and still worth having: **a commit trailer
 * survives the container**, and a session's own id is not resolvable from
 * outside itself. So this remains the right tool for *what did each session
 * DO in this window* — it reads commits — and the wrong first question for
 * *who is here now*. An agent that can call the session API asks that first.
 *
 * ## The trailer is the identity, and that is not a workaround
 *
 * A session is an ephemeral container. Its id is not resolvable from outside
 * itself, and nothing about it survives the container — except what it
 * committed. `Claude-Session:` on a commit is therefore the only DURABLE
 * session identity this repository has, and a branch tip is the only durable
 * statement of where a session got to.
 *
 * So a session's state here is **inferred**, and the report says so rather
 * than presenting the inference as a lookup. What can be known: which commits
 * a session authored, when it started and stopped committing, and which
 * branches carry its work. What cannot: whether it is still running. A session
 * that has stopped committing may be thinking, blocked, or gone, and this tool
 * refuses to guess between them — the same three-state discipline the rest of
 * the sweep uses, at the one place an agent most wants a yes or no.
 *
 * ## Why a tool rather than a paragraph
 *
 * `ab3n`'s Done-when says "a one-command sweep exists (a Tool node, not
 * prose)". Prose describing how to grep a trailer is a procedure every session
 * re-derives slightly differently; the counts then disagree and nobody can
 * tell which sweep was wrong.
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run sessions --since 4h          # this window
 * bun run sessions --since 2026-09-20  # from a date
 * bun run sessions --json
 * ```
 *
 * @module folio-assistant/scripts/sibling-sessions
