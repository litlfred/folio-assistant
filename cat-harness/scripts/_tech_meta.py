"""Technical facts about an ingested file — one definition, shared by the rungs.

Bean `nso8`. `pdf-structure.py` already wrote a `source` block; `pdf-pages.py`
wrote none, so a document ingested ONLY through the no-outline rung carried no
technical metadata at all. Measured 2026-09-19: `library/milnorlink/` — the one
entry `pdf-structure` never touched — has `source` absent, while the other two
page-granularity entries have it only because `pdf-structure` ran on them first
and `pdf-pages` merges into the existing file.

Underscore-prefixed because a module with a hyphen cannot be imported; same
reason as `_pdf_doc_id.py` and `_pypdf_compat.py`. Importable rather than
copied for the reason `rlp5` records: three spellings of `slugify` existed
before that module, and a copy drifts.

## The mimetype is SNIFFED, and that is the point of it

An extension is a claim by whoever named the file; the magic bytes are what the
content actually is. A `.pdf` that is really HTML — an error page saved by a
download that failed — extracts to nothing, and every downstream verdict about
it is about the wrong document.

So {@link sniff_mimetype} reads the leading bytes and returns **None** when it
does not recognise them. It never falls back to the extension: a guess that
agrees with the filename is indistinguishable from a real sniff, which makes
the field worthless for exactly the case it exists to catch. "Could not
determine" is a third state here as everywhere else in this repository.
