/**
 * Publish a folio's `main` site at the root of its publish branch, so a
 * preview has a "before" side. Bean `5uuf`, epic `q4jm`.
 *
 * @module scripts/publish-main-site
 *
 * The visual diff pictures each changed block on the published main site, and
 * the review page links "view on main" to it. Until this script, nothing
 * published a folio's `main` at all: every before picture read "its page is
 * not in the published site" and every such link 404'd (found by `ojcx`'s real
 * run on litlfred/folio-test#6).
 *
 * ## It deletes only what it wrote
 *
 * The root of the publish branch is shared: `STAGING/` holds every open PR's
 * preview, `_render-log/` the render history, and a folio may keep files there
 * by hand (a `CNAME`, a verification file). Replacing the root wholesale would
 * delete all of it, which is the `plj1` failure. Overlaying without deleting
 * keeps pages `main` stopped producing, so a reviewer checking a removal is
 * told it did not happen (`85im`).
 *
 * So every publish writes a manifest, `_main-site.json`, listing the files it
 * put there, and the next publish removes exactly those before copying. A
 * file the manifest does not name is never touched. The first publish has no
 * manifest, so it removes nothing, and says how many files it found and left.
 *
 * It refuses a site that would write into a reserved path, before touching
 * anything.
 *
 * Usage: bun run cat-harness/scripts/publish-main-site.ts --site _site --pages pages
