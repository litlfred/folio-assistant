/**
 * Where the Jekyll-built documentation tree sits under the published site.
 *
 * @module scripts/docs-route
 *
 * ## The rule this implements, in the owner's words
 *
 * 2026-10-05 (issue #2188, bean `kc7k`): cat-harness's documentation pages
 * publish under `<base-url>/docs/cat-harness/<page>.html`, not at the site
 * root — *"we dont need redirects for old way. clean break/migration"*. The
 * root had become 108 entries mixing doc pages, instance mounts, graph-kind
 * directories, locale directories and JSON-LD exports, and `architecture` and
 * `skills` were each both a page and a directory there.
 *
 * It is the addressing rule of 2026-09-20 applied to the one instance it had
 * not reached: `<base-url>/<kind>/<instance>/`. who-iris's documentation was
 * already at `/docs/who-iris/` (`mount-instance-docs.ts`); the built
 * instance's is now at `/docs/<built>/` by the same rule, rather than being
 * the exception that owned the root.
 *
 * ## One answer, read rather than written down
 *
 * The route is the `docs` KIND and the built instance's declared NAME — the
 * same two facts `mount-instance-docs.ts` composes `/docs/who-iris/` from. A
 * literal `docs/cat-harness` in each workflow step would be a second answer to
 * "where are the docs", free to disagree with the declaration the day the
 * instance is renamed.
 *
 * The one place the route IS written as a literal is `_config.yml`'s
 * `baseurl`, because Jekyll reads nothing else. `docs-route.test.ts` checks
 * that literal against this function, so the two cannot drift silently.
 *
 * Usage (prints the route and nothing else, for `ROUTE=$(…)`):
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/docs-route.ts --built cat-harness
