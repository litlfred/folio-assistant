/**
 * Write or retire the `staging-preview` record for one preview.
 *
 * @module scripts/staging-record
 *
 * Bean `6pfo`. `feature-staging.yml` is the only thing that knows a preview's
 * pull request and issue, and it already fires at both ends of a preview's
 * life — `pull_request [opened, synchronize, reopened]` and
 * `pull_request_target [closed]`. This is what it calls at each.
 *
 * ## Why this is a script and not inline YAML
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-19, on where the write and remove logic belongs: *"that's
 * part of the behaviour of that node type."* The rules live in
 * `schemas/staging-preview.ts` — what a record carries, that retirement is a
 * state rather than a deletion, that retiring twice keeps the first
 * retirement. A workflow step that built the JSON with `jq` would be a second
 * copy of those rules, free to disagree with the first the moment either
 * changed. This file is a thin caller so that cannot happen.
 *
 * ## `create` is idempotent on purpose, and not by overwriting
 *
 * `synchronize` fires on every push to an open pull request, so `create` runs
 * many times for one preview. It REFUSES to overwrite a retired record and
 * otherwise preserves the original `builtAt`, because that field answers "when
 * did this preview first appear" — a value that walks forward on every push
 * answers nothing. The head commit IS updated, since that is the one deploy
 * fact that legitimately changes.
 *
 * ## Enrichment is deliberately absent
 *
 * Size, file count and liveness are the health sweep's knowledge, and
 * `health-check.yml` is `contents: read` DELIBERATELY — AGENTS.md: "It reports
 * and never acts", with bean `plj1` as the worked example of a reporting tool
 * that acted. Owner chose 2026-09-20 to drop enrichment rather than grant that
 * workflow write. So a record carries what the deploy knows and nothing it
 * would have to guess.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/staging-record.ts create --out FILE --slug S --branch B \
 *     --commit C [--pr N] [--issue N] [--host URL]
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/staging-record.ts retire --out FILE --reason "..."
