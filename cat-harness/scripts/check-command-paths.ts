/**
 * A path inside a **fenced command** still resolves.
 *
 * Bean `b963`. `AGENTS.md` line 3 is the cold-start line every agent runs
 * before anything else, and after the split it read:
 *
 * ```sh
 * scripts/install-beans.sh && export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
 * ```
 *
 * There is no root `scripts/` — the script moved under `cat-harness/scripts/`.
 * So a fresh container following the first instruction it reads got
 * *"No such file or directory"* and no work-plan CLI. Nine occurrences across
 * `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` and the onboarding guide, and **four more** in
 * `session-start-coord-sweep.sh`, which prints the same line for an agent to
 * copy. Bean `z9eb` is the same defect inside a skill: `session-intent`
 * step 1 was *"Open `STATUS.md`"*, and `ls STATUS.md` fails here.
 *
 * ## Why the two neighbouring checks both miss it by design
 *
 * | check | reads |
 * |---|---|
 * | `check:agent-entry-links` | markdown **links** out of the entry files |
 * | `check:agents-claims` | LOCATION claims — `symbol` in `module.ts` — and absence claims |
 * | `check:declared-paths` | path literals in **code** |
 * | *this* | paths inside fenced **commands**, and in the prose of a skill |
 *
 * A path in a command is not a link, not a claim about a symbol, and not a
 * literal in a `.ts` file. It sits in exactly the gap between them, which is
 * how one rotted in the file a newcomer reads first and stayed there. AGENTS.md
 * records the same defect for two generator commands "until 2026-09-20" — it
 * was fixed in one file and not in the other two, because nothing swept.
 *
 * ## What counts as a path, and why the rule is conservative
 *
 * A token is a candidate when it **contains a `/` and looks like a file or
 * directory**, or ends in a known script extension. It is checked only when it
 * is **repository-relative and static**: a token carrying `$`, `<`, `*`, `~`
 * or a URL scheme is a template or an example, and a check that guessed at
 * those would cry wolf until somebody deleted it.
 *
 * The conservatism is deliberate and is the whole design. A check over prose
 * has to be RIGHT rather than thorough, because its findings are read by a
 * person deciding whether to keep it. Everything it declines to judge is
 * COUNTED in the summary rather than disappearing, so the coverage is visible.
 *
 * Exit: 0 every checked path resolves, 1 one does not, 2 could not check.

 * A command a program PRINTS, or tells a reader to run in its own header.

 * `docs:harness:check` printed **while failing** read:
 *
 * ```
 * Run `bun run cat-harness/scripts/sync-docs-harness.ts` and commit the result.
 * ```
 *
 * There is no root `scripts/`. The instruction telling a reader how to fix the
 * failure named a path that does not exist — and neither of the two readers
 * above can see it: it is neither a fenced block nor a JSON `command` field,
 * but a string literal in a `.ts` file.
 *
 * ## Two signals, and the second is what makes it decidable
 *
 * The corpus overlaps `check:declared-paths`, which walks every literal here.
 * The question is what differs: not *does this path resolve* but **is this a
 * command somebody will type, written from the wrong place**.
 *
 * **First, a RUNNER VERB.** `scripts/x.ts` appears in this source two ways
 * that must not be confused, and both are the same string:
 *
 * | | example | correct relative to |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | a cross-reference in prose | ``see `scripts/known-skills.ts` `` | the INSTANCE — and it resolves |
 * | a command in a header or a message | `bun run cat-harness/scripts/lean-audit.ts` | the REPOSITORY — where a person stands |
 *
 * Only the second is wrong. `bun run`, `bunx`, `bash`, `npx`, `python3`,
 * `deno run` say a human is about to execute this, and nothing else does.
 *
 * **Second, the path must RESOLVE UNDER AN INSTANCE.** This is what the first
 * draft got wrong and it gutted the check: it reused {@link aboutThisTree},
 * which judges a path only when its first segment exists at the repository
 * root — and `scripts/` does not exist there, *which is the entire defect*.
 * The check declined the one case it was written for, and reported 43 paths
 * checked where a hand grep found 370 candidates.
 *
 * So the rule is inverted, and the inversion is the design:
 *
 * > **The path does not resolve from the repository root, but
 * > `<instance>/<path>` does.** That is not "a path that might be wrong" — it
 * > is a path that is wrong *and whose fix is known*, so the finding names it.
 *
 * A path that resolves nowhere is a folio's (`content/pipeline/qa-sweep.ts` is
 * correct in a folio and this repository carries none) and is COUNTED, never
 * failed. Instance roots are discovered as the directories carrying their own
 * `harness.json`, not listed here — a list would rot on the next split, which
 * is the defect this whole check exists for.
 *
 * ## Two stated limits
 *
 * **`node` and `sh` are not in the verb list.** They are ordinary words in
 * this codebase — "node" appears in nearly every graph module — and including
 * them matched prose like *"node resolves to its `.md`"*. Measured: four
 * findings, all four false. A verb that is also English is not a signal.
 *
 * **A bare invocation with no runner verb is not detected.**
 * `scripts/install-beans.sh && export PATH=…` has no verb in front of it.
 * Named rather than papered over: widening to "a line beginning with a path"
 * would match the prose class above, which is the larger one. Where such a
 * line is printed it usually sits in a fenced block or a hook command, which
 * the other two readers cover.

/**
 * The commands in `.claude/settings.json` — the ones nobody types.
 *
 * **This is the `b963` class at its most consequential, and it was found by
 * this check's own corpus NOT covering it.** On 2026-09-20 the `SessionStart`
 * hook read:
 *
 * ```
 * bash "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/scripts/session-start-coord-sweep.sh"
 * ```
 *
 * There is no root `scripts/`. So the hook that installs the `beans` CLI and
 * prints the work-plan sweep had been a **silent no-op for every session since
 * the split** — and a hook that fails is indistinguishable from a hook that ran
 * and found nothing to say, which is the `xom7` shape exactly.
 *
 * It needs its own reader because a hook command is not in a fenced block and
 * not in markdown: it is a JSON string field, so the whole corpus above walks
 * straight past it. `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is the repository root, so the path
 * after it is repository-relative and judged as one — the expansion is
 * stripped by {@link shellWords} like any other, which is why it is put back
 * here rather than left for the tokenizer to guess at.
