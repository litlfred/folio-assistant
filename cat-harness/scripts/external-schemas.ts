 * difference produced a FALSE FINDING pointing at the most load-bearing record
 * in the registry:
 *
 *     · 2 declared namespace(s) nothing uses — a record outliving its dependency:
 *         http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
 *         http://purl.org/dc/terms/
 *
 * Dublin Core is used 43 times. `dcterms:title` is in the glossary document's
 * own `@context` and on its scheme node. The remedy the finding offered —
 * delete the record — would have unpinned the edition of a vocabulary the
 * repository actively emits, and a gate whose remedy is wrong is worse than
 * one that says nothing, which is the argument the OWN-namespace block twenty
 * lines up already makes for a different case.
 *
 * The cause is that a vocabulary can be used in more than one syntax. BPMN
 * binds namespaces with `xmlns`; JSON-LD binds them in `@context`. A reader
 * that knows one syntax reports the other as absent — the same shape as the
 * `<bpmn:`-prefixed regexes that read a default-namespace diagram as empty.
 *
 * So the scan is by IRI STRING over the source tree, which is syntax-agnostic
 * by construction and cannot acquire a third blind spot the day somebody emits
 * a vocabulary in a form neither reader knows.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED, each for a different reason:
 *   - `external-schemas/` — every record names its own IRIs, so including it
 *     makes every record self-justifying and the check vacuous.
 *   - generated trees (`_kg/`, `docs/`) — an answer that depends on whether a
 *     generator has run is not reproducible on a fresh clone.
 *   - `node_modules/` — not this corpus.
 *
 * This feeds the UNUSED question only. `undeclared` still reads diagram
 * bindings, on purpose: widening it would demand a registry record for every
 * IRI mentioned anywhere — `owl:`, `rdfs:`, `schema:` — which is a different
 * and much larger decision. Filed rather than taken: bean `2j09`.
