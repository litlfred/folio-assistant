/**
 * The runtime half of the input-site audit — bean `f017`.
 *
 * @module scripts/input-trace
 * @graphNode none — a one-function hook called at `traced` input sites
 *
 * `input-sites.ts` audits a check's import closure STATICALLY, which
 * over-approximates: a `git ls-remote` inside a function that no check ever
 * calls still sits in the closure of every check whose imports reach its
 * module (an instance's `platform.ts` barrel makes that most of them). Such a
 * site cannot honestly be called `inert`, and leaving it unannotated makes
 * every one of those checks unskippable.
 *
 * So a site may instead be `traced`: the line directly above it calls
 * {@link inputSiteReached}. When `regen` or `gates` runs a check it may record,
 * it names a fresh trace file in {@link TRACE_ENV}; a run that REACHED a traced
 * site writes to it, and that run records nothing. A run that did not reach it
 * records as usual — and the next run on the same inputs takes the same path
 * (every other input it reads is hashed or audited), so it does not reach it
 * either. Child processes inherit the variable with the rest of the
 * environment.
