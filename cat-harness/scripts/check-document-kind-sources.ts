/**
 * check:document-kind-sources — a section's `computedFrom` names a graph its
 * instance can actually reach. Bean `qvxh`.
 *
 * `computedFrom` is how a document kind says *"this section is computable from
 * these assets"* (`schemas/document-kind.ts`). The schema says it names
 * DECLARED graph ids "so a reader can ask whether the graph exists rather than
 * take the prose's word for it" — and until this check nothing asked. A typo,
 * a renamed directory, or a graph that was never declared (the external
 * evidence a guideline cites, say) would read as a computable claim.
 *
 * An id resolves when it is a directory id declared by the kind's own instance
 * or by an instance it `needs`, transitively — the same `allowedFromNeeds`
 * direction `check:import-direction` and `check:process-bindings` use, because
 * an instance inherits its dependencies' directories and nothing above it.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-04 (qvxh, option 1): name what is not yet a graph rather than
 * fake one. A section whose content needs evidence nobody has ingested says so
 * in its description and carries NO `computedFrom` — an empty declared graph
 * would be the `dh4f` defect, a scan over nothing reported clean.
 *
