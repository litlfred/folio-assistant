/**
 * A milestone's progress, as the closure of the beans beneath it.
 *
 * @module scripts/milestone-rollup
 * @graphNode none — a pure function over the bean store
 * @covers none — it measures the work plan; the verdicts on it live in `check-bean-*`
 *
 * ## Why this is a module and not three implementations
 *
 * Three consumers need the same number: the terminal report
 * (`milestone-status.ts`), the committed projection the board fetches
 * (`gen-docs-pages.ts` writes `milestones` into `assets/beans/index.json`),
 * and the board itself, which therefore RENDERS the projection rather than
 * recomputing it. The alternative — the page deriving its own rollup from the
 * `items` it already loads — is a second answer to one question, free to
 * disagree with the first, which is what `kg:audit` and
 * `github-state-inspection` both say outright and what this repository has
 * paid for repeatedly.
 *
 * So: one definition here, one writer, and the page gets a number it does not
 * compute.
 *
 * ## The closure is TRANSITIVE, not two levels
 *
 * It is tempting to read the hierarchy as milestone → epic → task and count
 * the grandchildren. `check-bean-parents` rule 3 admits a parent whose `type`
 * is `epic` **or** `milestone`, and says nothing against an epic parented to
 * another epic — so the depth is whatever the store happens to hold, and a
 * fixed two-level walk would silently drop every bean below an epic nested
 * under an epic. Descent is transitive, with a visited guard: nothing in
 * `check-bean-parents` forbids a cycle among epics, and a cycle met by a naive
 * walk is a hang rather than a finding.
 *
 * ## `unclassified` is a THIRD bucket, never folded into either
 *
 * `OPEN_STATUSES` and `CLOSED_STATUSES` do not partition every string a
 * `status` field can hold. A descendant in neither set is counted on its own
 * and left out of both, because folding it into `open` inflates the work
 * remaining and folding it into `closed` reports progress that was never made.
 * A zero here is the normal case; a non-zero one is a finding about the store.
 *
 * ## The percentage is REPORTED, not graded — and it is bean-weighted
 *
 * `share` is `closed / classified`, which weights every bean equally: a
 * milestone whose remaining work is one large bean reads worse than one with
 * ten trivial ones. That is a real limit of counting beans, so the counts are
 * the answer and the share is a convenience derived from them. Nothing here
 * sets an exit code on it. The repository already draws this line —
 * `audit:coverage` reports its counts and deliberately does not grade the
 * share (bean `3yi4`).
 *
 * `orphanOpen` exists for the same honesty: open beans under no milestone at
 * all. If that number is large the per-milestone shares do not describe the
 * repository, and a reader cannot tell without being told.
 *
 * ## `coveredOpen` is SUMMED, never subtracted — and a duplicate id is why
 *
 * The obvious way to say how much the shares cover is `openTotal -
 * orphanOpen`. That is a different number from the sum of the bars, and the
 * first run of this module found out how: **two bean FILES share the id
 * `folio-assistant-t3n8`** (measured 2026-10-03 — 675 files, 674 distinct
 * ids), so a count over files and a count over ids differ by one, and the two
 * figures disagreed on a board that showed both.
 *
 * Both halves of that are fixed here rather than papered over. The counts are
 * taken over DISTINCT ids, because a bean is its id — it is what a commit, an
 * issue and another bean's `parent` reference. And `duplicateIds` is reported,
 * because the alternative is a module that silently absorbs a store defect no
 * gate currently catches: `check:bean-front-matter`, `check:bean-parents` and
 * `check:bean-bodies` are all green on it.
 *
 * Which of the two files keeps the id is a judgement about somebody's work and
 * belongs to its owner — and no bean is ever deleted here, so this reports and
 * changes nothing.
