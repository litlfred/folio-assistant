/**
 * The single way a steward lands a pull request.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/merge-guard
 * @covers none — a merge precondition over GitHub's live facts about one PR; it judges no declared graph
 *
 * Bean `uoob` (merge gate (f), epic `nok9`). Owner ruling 2026-10-03, option 1: build an ENFORCED merge
 * guard. Until this existed, the Merge Manager steward landed PRs with
 *
 * ```
 * gh api -X PUT repos/litlfred/folio-assistant/pulls/<n>/merge -f sha=<head>
 * ```
 *
 * under the owner's token, and nothing between "the steward decided" and "the
 * PR is on its base" asked whether the PR was finished. Three were not:
 *
 * | PR | what was wrong when it merged |
 * |---|---|
 * | #1937 | its base was `claude/quirky-davinci-ixuymr`, the head of #1764, which had ALREADY merged, so it landed on a dead branch; its head was newer than its `ready:` comment, and the commits in between were a hand merge and two claim commits, not bot merges; `needs-merge-human` was still on it; its own `pull_request` runs had failed and only a `workflow_dispatch` run was green |
 * | #1960 | no `ready-to-merge` label, no `ready:` comment, and its body still read `- [ ] CI green` |
 * | #1957 | the steward itself called `ready_for_review` and added `ready-to-merge`, 75 s before merging; there was no `ready:` comment at all |
 *
 * No workflow merges into a base (`merge-main.yml` merges `main` INTO PRs only),
 * the repository's rulesets are empty, and its branch protection could not be
 * read. So the only thing that could have stopped any of the three was the
 * steward's memory, and it did not.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```
 * bun run merge:guard <pr>                         # evaluate only
 * bun run merge:guard <pr> --merge --session <id>  # land it, only if every check passes
 * ```
 *
 * `--session` is the MERGING session (an id `session_…` or its URL). It is
 * required with `--merge`, because check 2 asks whether that session is the
 * one that marked the PR ready. `--no-merge-manager` lifts that separation
 * when no Merge Manager is active and the PR's own session merges (owner
 * ruling 2026-10-06); everything else is still checked. `--status` also posts the verdict as the
 * `merge-guard` commit status on the head, which is what the workflow does.
 *
 * ## The eight checks
 *
 * Every refusal names its check, by number and by id:
 *
 * 1. `base` — the base is `main`, the PR is open, and the base is not the head
 *    branch of a merged PR (#1937).
 * 2. `ready-for-review` — not a draft; and the latest `ready_for_review` event
 *    is attributable to the PR's OWN session, never the merging one (#1957) —
 *    unless `--no-merge-manager`: with no Merge Manager active, the own
 *    session IS the merging one (owner ruling 2026-10-06).
 * 3. `ready-marker` — a `ready: <sha>` comment whose session footer is the
 *    PR's own session, and `<sha>` is the head or every commit after it is a
 *    merge-main bot merge (#1937, #1960, #1957).
 * 4. `labels` — `ready-to-merge` present, `needs-merge-human` absent (#1937, #1960).
 * 5. `ci` — every `pull_request` run on the head is `success` or `skipped`,
 *    and every workflow owed for that event ran (#1937). One substitution: on
 *    a head that is a merge-main bot merge, a `pull_request` run GitHub held
 *    for approval (`NOT_EXECUTED`, bean `0qjq`) is judged by the latest
 *    `workflow_dispatch` run of the same workflow on the head — green counts,
 *    running is not-ready, red is a defect. Held with no dispatch: refused
 *    not-ready if `merge-main.yml` dispatches that workflow (it is still
 *    owed), reported "not judged" if it does not (preview-only), `unknown` if
 *    that file's dispatch line cannot be parsed. One exemption from WAITING,
 *    never from judging: a workflow in {@link NOT_WAITED_FOR_WORKFLOW_FILES}
 *    (Feature Staging, owner ruling 2026-10-05, bean `gnnj`) that is still in
 *    flight or has not started is not a refusal; once finished, red refuses.
 * 6. `checklist` — no unticked `- [ ]` item in the body (#1960).
 * 7. `open-question` — no comment newer than the ready marker asks the owner
 *    or the Merge Manager an open question. A heuristic; its limits are on
 *    {@link openQuestions}.
 * 8. `mergeable` — GitHub says the head still merges cleanly into its base
 *    (bean `vihx`). Check 5's runs tested the head merged with main AS MAIN
 *    WAS when the head was pushed; once main moves, a stale green head with a
 *    valid marker passed checks 1-7 while it conflicted (#1898, and two HTTP
 *    405 "merge conflicts" refusals on 2026-10-05). `mergeable: false` (or
 *    `mergeable_state: dirty`) refuses not-ready; `null` — GitHub has not
 *    computed it yet — is `unknown`, after {@link fetchSnapshot} re-asks a few
 *    times. `unstable` and `blocked` pass here: they are about checks, which
 *    check 5 judges.
 *
 * ## Exit codes
 *
 * | code | means |
 * |---|---|
 * | 0 | every check passed (and, with `--merge`, the PR merged) |
 * | 1 | refused: at least one check failed, and every check could be asked |
 * | 2 | could not determine: a fact could not be read, or bad usage |
 *
 * ## The commit status (`--status`)
 *
 * | verdict | status | when |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | pass | `success` | every check passes |
 * | refused, every refusal `not-ready` | `pending` | a draft, no marker, no label, an unticked box, CI still running, an open question, a conflict with main |
 * | refused, any refusal a `defect` | `failure` | a base that is not `main` or is dead, `needs-merge-human`, red CI, a marker or ready-flip by another session |
 * | unknown | `error` | a fact could not be read |
 *
 * `pending` exists so that every unfinished PR is not painted red, which
 * would teach readers to ignore red ({@link RefusalKind}). A required check
 * blocks the merge in every state but `success`, and the exit code is 1 for
 * both kinds of refusal.
 *
 * **Unknown is never a pass.** A check that could not ask returns `unknown`,
 * and an unknown anywhere makes the whole verdict `unknown` even when another
 * check refused. A guard blind on one check has not cleared the others.
 *
 * ## Why attribution goes through comments, not the event's actor
 *
 * Every session here acts with the owner's token, so every timeline event's
 * actor is `litlfred`: the actor login cannot tell the owning session from
 * the steward. The session IS recorded in the footer of what a session posts
 * (`https://claude.ai/code/session_…`). So a `ready_for_review` event is
 * attributed to the session of the nearest session-bearing comment within
 * {@link READY_WINDOW_MS}, and the rule the owning session follows is: **mark
 * the PR ready and post its `ready: <sha>` marker together.** `--actor` is
 * still compared, for the day a steward acts under its own login.
 *
 * ## What this does not stop
 *
 * It guards against a CARELESS steward, not a hostile author: a PR may edit
 * `.github/workflows/merge-guard.yml` in its own tree, and every check reads
 * text a session wrote. The workflow runs this script from `main`'s copy for
 * that reason, but a pull_request run still uses the PR's workflow file.
