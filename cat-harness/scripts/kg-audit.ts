/**
 * Audit the knowledge graph — processes, decisions, roles, skills — and write
 * one QA sidecar per audited node.
 *
 * The model it checks is one sentence: **an actor performs a task in a process
 * as a role, using that role's skills.** Every join in that sentence is a place
 * two independently-edited files can stop agreeing, and until now only one of
 * them was checked at all (`check-workflow-refs.ts`, on skill refs). This walks
 * the rest:
 *
 *   activity ──names──▶ skill          skill-ref-resolves
 *   activity ──sits in─▶ lane          activity-in-lane
 *   lane     ──is─────▶ role           lane-binds-role · role-ref-resolves
 *   role     ──carries▶ skill          role-carries-activity-skill · role-skills-resolve
 *   role     ──is-a───▶ role           role-inherits-resolves
 *   actor    ──takes on▶ role          role-has-actor
 *   gateway  ──computes▶ decision      decision-ref-resolves · decision-outcomes-used
 *
 * ## Why sidecars rather than a console report
 *
 * `check-workflow-refs.ts` prints and exits, so its previous answer is gone.
 * That makes "this lane has been unbound since the day it was drawn" and "this
 * lane broke in the commit under review" indistinguishable, and a reviewer
 * cannot separate a new defect from inherited debt. The sidecars are committed,
 * so the diff says exactly which findings a change introduced. Same argument,
 * and same file shape, as the block sweep's `*.qa.json` and the script sweep's
 * `*.script-qa.json`; schema in `schemas/kg-qa.ts`.
 *
 * ## Gate
 *
 *   bun run kg:audit            write sidecars, print a summary, exit 0
 *   bun run kg:audit --check    fail on a `critical` finding, or on a stale sidecar
 *   bun run kg:audit --strict   ...and on `major` too
 *   bun run kg:audit --json     the full report set, for a tool
 *   bun run kg:audit --instance ./bootstrap
 *                               audit ANOTHER declared instance from its own
 *                               root, writing its sidecars under its own
 *                               results directory (bean `bjzs`)
 *
 * A diagram that will not load records `unknown` against every criterion,
 * including the critical ones, so it fails `--check`. `unknown` is never
 * written as a pass.
 *
 * @module scripts/kg-audit
 * @covers processes, scenarios, skills, tools, cat-harness, attestations — the graph typologies
 *   `KG_SUBJECT_GRAPH_TYPOLOGIES` maps its seven subject kinds onto, plus the
 *   attestation store it reads and `--check`s (bean `2gst`)

/**
 * The instance under audit — `--instance ROOT`, defaulting to the auditor's own.
 *
 * ## Why one assignment rather than a thread through 78 call sites
 *
 * Everything this script reads derives from here: the nine `*_DIR` constants
 * below, `knownSkills(root)`, and `sidecarPath`'s
 * `dirname(join(root, subject.path))`. So pointing this one constant at another
 * declared instance moves the whole audit, its subject discovery AND its output,
 * with no change at any other site. Bean `bjzs` estimated this as *"`root` × 76
 * across 2344 lines plus 9 derived `*_DIR` constants"* and banked it as
 * expensive; measured, the cost is this assignment plus the auditor-hash split
 * above, because nothing needs a DIFFERENT root part-way through a run.
 *
 * ## Why the sidecars land correctly for free
 *
 * `kgQaSidecarPath(repoRoot, subjectDir, stem)` composes with `relative` and
 * handles an escaping subject explicitly — `escaped = rel.startsWith("..")`. So
 * bean `chq5`'s concern, that a `../` subject escapes the results tree, is
 * answered inside that helper rather than needing an answer here, and each
 * instance's findings land under its own results directory: an instance's audit
 * is an artefact OF that instance, the same way its glossary is.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It does not declare a nested instance's directories at the root. That is the
 * wrong fix established twice (`pve3`, `sa8y`) and guarded by
 * `instance-graph-isolation.test.ts` after a live 2026-09-19 leak in which
 * `findBpmnDirs` walked the filesystem and one export carried 88 references to
 * another instance's process. Per-instance means a separate RUN, not a wider
 * walk.
 *
 * Parsed here rather than beside `--check` at the bottom because the nine
 * derived constants are evaluated at module scope, immediately below.

 * diagrams moved into `processes/` that day (the owner's "dont bury sub-graph
 * assets"), the second declaration was dropped, and exactly one directory
 * holds `processes` now. So the by-kind lookup would no longer throw here.
 *
 * The id lookup stays, because the reason was never the count: a by-kind
 * lookup that happens to work while one directory exists is a call that starts
 * throwing the day a second is declared, and it would be asking the wrong

/**
 * One sidecar per Tool node, PROJECTING verdicts the dedicated checkers reach.
 *
 * ## Why this projects rather than decides
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-22, and it overturned the plan it was measured for. The
 * bean behind issue #853 called Tool nodes *"unaudited, 69 of them"*. They are
 * unaudited BY THIS SCRIPT; they are not unaudited. `check-tools.ts` and
 * `tools.test.ts` already decide `satisfies`, invoke paths, io IRIs, unsafe
 * args, alternatives and contracts, and `check-maintained-artefacts.ts`
 * decides every `maintains` claim against the assembled tree.
 *
 * A first attempt here added a `maintains` criterion of its own. That would
 * have been a **second answer** to a question `check-maintained-artefacts`
 * already answers, free to disagree with it — which is the defect the bean's
 * own "Do not" warns about, one step removed.
 *
 * So what is added is the REPORTING SURFACE, not a judgement: a committed
 * sidecar per Tool, which is what makes "unbound since it was drawn"
 * distinguishable from "broken in the commit under review". A printed verdict
 * cannot do that, and that is `AGENTS.md`'s own argument for sidecars.
 *
 * ## The two states that are not `pass`
 *
 * `n/a` where the property does not apply — a Tool with no derived
 * alternative has no choice to explain, and recording that as a pass would
 * count 100-odd non-answers as evidence.
 *
 * `unknown` for `tool-maintains-in-tree`, ALWAYS, from a checkout: the
 * artefact's presence is a fact about `_site/`, which does not exist here. The
 * finding names where the answer lives rather than pretending to be it.
 */
/**
 * The Tool nodes of the instance under audit — the repository's at the root.

 * **The third cross-instance leak, and the last of the three.** The other two
 * were a `scope` declaration (repo actors judged against one instance's roles:
 * 73 false criticals) and a one-line guard in `readSatisfiers` (repo
 * capabilities against one instance's requirements: 3 more). This one was
 * neither, because the criteria are RIGHT: the six `tool-*` criteria are
 * correctly `instance`-scoped, and what was wrong is the set they read.
 * `checkTools()` took no root at all, so `--instance ./bootstrap` audited
 * cat-harness's 119 Tools as bootstrap's. Fixing it by reclassifying the
 * criteria would have thrown away the legitimate instance half — the same
 * mistake avoided in `readSatisfiers`, and the reason both fixes are in the

 *    were the others. A hardcoded root scans the wrong tree the moment the
 *    layout moves, which it did on 2026-09-20.
 * 2. **A manifest AT a declared directory was invisible**, because the walk only
 *    looked inside subdirectories. `gen-skill-docs` already documents that two
 *    declared directories — `bootstrap` and `cat-harness-src` — "hold their
 *    skills DIRECTLY rather than in package subdirectories". So a manifest for
 *    those could not be found however correctly it was written, which is why

/**
 * The skills a REFERENCE in this instance may resolve to: its own, plus every

 *
 * ## Why resolution is wider than ownership
 *
 * A skill ref names a body an activity's performer must read, and a body in a
 * DEPENDENCY is one this instance may read — that is what depending on it
 * means. Resolving refs against `knownSkills(root)` alone made every such ref
 * dangle: measured 2026-09-27, `smart-base` reported `skill-ref-resolves`
 * **fail (9)** on nine activities of `diig-investment-path.bpmn`, all naming
 * the one skill `methodology-adoption`, which lives at
 * `cat-harness/skills/process/process-core/methodology-adoption.md` — four layers down
 * its own declared `needs` chain. Nine criticals against a diagram that is
 * correct.
 *
 * The auditor's own run already knew: `test/results/kg-qa/_external/smart-base/`
 * recorded `skill-ref-resolves` **pass (0)** for that same diagram, because from
 * here the skill is local. So the two runs disagreed about one file, and the
 * instance-scoped one was wrong. (That `_external/` copy was itself the
 * defect's enabler — two verdicts about one subject — and was deleted with the
 * other seven on 2026-10-01, Q-A PR 4; the owner's run now holds the only one.)
 *
 * ## This is the FIFTH cross-instance defect, and the only DOWNWARD one
 *
 * The other four leaked things an instance should not see (a repo's actors, its
 * capabilities, 119 phantom tool sidecars, 23 skills from `.claude/skills/`) and
 * were fixed by NARROWING. This one is the opposite polarity: an instance could
 * not see what is legitimately BELOW it. A narrowing fix cannot find it, which
 * is why it survived all four.
 *
 * ## Ownership stays narrow, deliberately
 *

 * The role IDS a REFERENCE in this instance may resolve to: its own graph's,

 * ## The same defect as {@link resolvableSkills}, one graph over
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-27, after the skill half landed: 11 of 13 nested instances
 * reported ZERO criticals, and the two that did not — `smart-base` and
 * `folio-assistant-core` — reported `role-ref-resolves` and
 * `raci-role-resolves`. Their diagrams name `business-analyst`,
 * `programme-manager` and `deep-researcher`, and **all three are defined in
 * `cat-harness/scenarios/roles.json`**, a transitive dependency of both. So
 * the refs are legitimate and the findings were not.
 *
 * ## IDS, not the graph — and that is the whole design
 *
 * Overlaying the `RoleGraph` OBJECT was considered and rejected on a
 * measurement. The audit emits one SUBJECT per role in the graph (the default
 * run reports "48 roles"), so an overlay would add bootstrap's four roles to
 * cat-harness's results as four new sidecars — for roles bootstrap's own run
 * already audits. That duplicates a dependency's subjects into its dependent,
 * which is the rule `instance-graph-isolation.test.ts` guards and this file's
 * own `root` docblock states: *per-instance means a separate RUN, not a wider
 * walk*.
 *
 * So resolution widens and SUBJECTHOOD does not — the identical `pve3` split
 * {@link resolvableSkills} applies. A set of ids answers "does this ref name
 * something that exists?" and cannot answer anything else, which is exactly
 * the question the two reference criteria ask.
 *
 * The five criteria that need role OBJECTS — `lane-binds-role`,
 * `role-carries-activity-skill`, `activity-fulfilment-kind` and the two RACI
 * shape checks — stay `unknown` for an instance with no graph of its own,
 * because judging carriage requires the definition and this instance does not
 * hold it. Their message is corrected rather than their verdict: saying only
 * "no role graph declared at scenarios/roles.json" reads as "these roles do
 * not exist", when they do, one layer down.

 * A sidecar whose subject MOVED follows it, instead of dying in place.

 * stranded at the old path, where the sweep below correctly reported it as
 * auditing a file that is not there. A verdict that has to be re-derived on
 * every relocation is a verdict nobody keeps.
 *
 * ## Why this is not the deletion the sweep refuses
 *
 * The sweep's own rule — REPORTED, NEVER DELETED — exists because an orphan
 * can mean the subject is temporarily UNDISCOVERED rather than gone, and
 * deleting on that evidence destroys a verdict to hide a declaration gap.
 * Nothing here deletes. A relocation PRESERVES the artefact and its history;
 * it moves the file to where its subject now lives, and an orphan that does
 * not match a moved subject is left exactly where it is, to be reported.
 *
 * ## The three conditions, and why each is required
 *
 * 1. `subjectExists === false` — CONFIRMED gone, never `undefined`. The third
 *    state is "could not read the sidecar", and a sidecar whose identity could
 *    not be read is precisely the one that must not be moved on a guess.
 * 2. The identity is `kind` + `id`, not the path and not the basename. The
 *    path is what changed; two packages can hold a same-named skill, so a
 *    basename match would move one package's verdict onto another's subject.
 * 3. Exactly ONE orphan and exactly ONE unwritten target per identity. Any
 *    ambiguity is left alone and reported: a verdict moved onto the wrong
 *    subject is worse than an orphan, because an orphan announces itself and
 *    a misfiled verdict reads as healthy.

  // ORPHANS FAIL, and they did not until the count reached zero.
  //
  // The sweep printed its findings to stderr and `orphans` appeared nowhere in
  // this expression, so `kg:audit:check` reported twelve and exited 0 — a
  // report nobody fails on, which is `xom7`: from inside a checkout that looks
  // exactly like a clean run. CI ran this command and was green over all of
  // them.
  //
  // Gating earlier would have been gating a backlog, which is how a check gets
  // switched off within a week. The repository's own precedent is the ruff
  // comment in `code-quality-gates.yml`: **a check is an error only once its
  // count is zero.** The twelve were cleared in the commit that added this
  // line — four whose subject had moved, eight written before
  // `isPartOfASkill` existed — so it starts at zero and any new one is a
  // regression rather than debt.
  //
  // Three further points, from a second session that reached this same change
  // independently and whose merge is where these were folded in:
  //
  //   · WHY the severity gate could not already see them: orphans are computed
  //     outside `reports`, so `worstSeverity` has nothing to rank. They are not
  //     findings ABOUT a subject — a stale sidecar is a verdict that has not
  //     caught up, an orphaned one a verdict about something this run did not
  //     judge — which is why they sit beside `stale` rather than inside the
  //     severity ladder.
  //   · ALL THREE orphan groups count, the UNREADABLE one included. `AGENTS.md`
  //     on this repository's own sweeps: could-not-determine "is never rendered
  //     as clean" and it "outranks a finding" — a sweep blind on one check has
  //     not cleared the others. Excluding the unresolvable case would put the
  //     third state back on the pass side.
  //   · Only `--check` gates. Bare `kg:audit` is the WRITER and still exits 0,
  //     or regenerating after a rename would fail the very command you run to
  //     fix it.
// A subject whose judgements could not be moved (ruling 2) was NOT written —
// the writer says so with its exit code too, or a script running it would
// read a refusal as a clean save.
