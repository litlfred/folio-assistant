/**
 * A turn that NAMES open decisions without their terms — the unguarded path.
 *
 * `interaction-modality` §4.1 has been STRICT since 2026-09-20 and carries
 * three enforcement layers. On 2026-09-26 the owner had to say, for the second
 * time in the same session:
 *
 * > *"You have yet again provided unanswered questions as blockers but have not
 * > provided exactly what the questions are pros cons recommendations and down
 * > steam impact"*
 *
 * The rule was not missing. §4.1 part 3 already required `downstream`;
 * §"More than one decision pending" already said **never a list of option
 * names**; and it already closed the obvious excuse — *"there is no 'just
 * listing what's open' exemption. A wrap-up that names a decision has handed it
 * over, whatever the framing sentence says."*
 *
 * ## Why three layers did not catch it
 *
 * Read their own stated limits, and the gap is structural rather than a lapse:
 *
 * | layer | keyed on |
 * |---|---|
 * | the skill | being read — "triggering is probabilistic" |
 * | `PreToolUse` → `ask-well.sh` | the `AskUserQuestion` **tool call** |
 * | `decision-request.ts` | decisions **rendered through it** |
 *
 * All three require the agent to CHOOSE to ask. The failure shape is the
 * opposite: a closing paragraph of an ordinary turn — "still yours: `bf5l`'s
 * layering ruling, task #26, the orphan branch, `e8m3`, `6ptx`, #951, #1340" —
 * which touches no tool and renders no schema. §4.1 predicted exactly this
 * surface (*"those are where it is most often broken, because they feel like
 * reporting rather than asking"*) and nothing guarded it.
 *
 * So this is a **fourth** layer, on `Stop`, where that paragraph has just been
 * written.
 *
 * ## It reminds and does not block, for the reason the owner already gave
 *
 * Bean `hajp` weighed blocking and the owner rejected it: a blocking hook that
 * misfires removes the escape hatch, leaving the agent unable even to report
 * that the gate is broken. That reasoning applies here with more force, because
 * this detector reads PROSE and prose is the thing a regex is worst at.
 *
 * ## The signal is narrow ON PURPOSE
 *
 * A turn legitimately names many ids while REPORTING finished work — "bean
 * `cjvs`, 190 dangling refs" is not a question. So the trigger is the
 * conjunction, not any part alone:
 *
 *   an outstanding-marker  ("still yours", "unanswered", "waiting on you", …)
 *   AND >= 2 identifiers   (4-char bean ids, `#1234`, task refs)
 *   AND no comparison      (no pro/con table, no "(Recommended)", no
 *                           "if you say nothing")
 *
 * Each alone fires constantly; together they are the forbidden shape. The
 * detector is exported so the fixtures below can be real turns from the session
 * that prompted it — a detector tested only on invented strings is a detector
 * tested on the author's idea of the defect.
