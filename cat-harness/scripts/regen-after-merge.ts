/**
 * Repair the generated artefacts a merge left wrong — by ASKING each gate.
 *
 * @module scripts/regen-after-merge
 * @graphNode none — a maintenance command over the gate set
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for
 *
 * Bean `lxpq`, measured on `main` at `3341108a`, 2026-09-22. Two branches
 * changed one committed generated file in NON-OVERLAPPING places:
 *
 *   main (`tis1`)  added `tile.voices.count` — a projection declares its count
 *   #827 (`26tu`)  added a sixth voice, `agent-skill-authoring`
 *
 * One touched the header, the other the array. Git merged them with **no
 * conflict** and produced a projection declaring `count: 5` while listing 6
 * voices — an artefact **neither side would ever emit**.
 *
 * **A conflict is a question; a clean merge is an assertion that the result is
 * correct.** That is why this is not bean `520m` and why
 * `qa:resolve-conflicts` cannot help: that command only ever inspects UNMERGED
 * paths, and here there were none.
 *
 * The general shape, which is not specific to voices:
 *
 * > A committed generated artefact can merge into a state no generator would
 * > produce, whenever two branches touch different parts of it. The only
 * > reliable check is to RE-RUN THE GENERATOR, never to read the diff — the
 * > merged file looks plausible from either side, which is exactly what let
 * > this one through.
 *
 * ## Why it asks the gates rather than regenerating everything
 *
 * "Regenerate everything declared" was the obvious repair and is the wrong
 * one twice over.
 *
 * **It would need a list, and the list is the defect.** `gates.ts` already
 * settled where the authority lives — *"the workflow is the authority, and
 * `package.json` is not"* — having measured that of the repository's `:check`
 * scripts, **21 appeared in no workflow at all**. A second list here, derived
 * from `package.json`, would run generators CI does not gate and would be a
 * guess that reads as coverage. So the gate set is loaded from the workflow,
 * through `loadGates`, and a `:check` CI does not run is not this command's
 * business.
 *
 * **And a blanket regeneration cannot tell repair from damage.** Running every
 * writer rewrites artefacts that were already correct, so the diff afterwards
 * says nothing about what the merge broke. Asking each check FIRST means the
 * output is exactly the set of artefacts the merge left wrong, which is the
 * question a person actually has after a merge.
 *
 * ## The three states, and the fourth that matters most
 *
 * | state | what happened |
 * |---|---|
 * | `current` | the check passed; nothing was run |
 * | `regenerated` | the check failed, its writer ran, the check now passes |
 * | **`unrepaired`** | the check failed, its writer ran, **and it still fails** |
 * | `no-writer` | the check failed and has no writer counterpart |
 * | `writer-failed` | the check failed, its writer EXITED NON-ZERO, and the check still fails |
 * | `no-browser` | as `unrepaired`/`writer-failed`, for a browser-job check on a machine with no Chromium |
 *
 * **`unrepaired` is the one this command exists to surface honestly.** A check
 * can fail for reasons that are not staleness — a real defect — and a tool
 * that ran a generator and then reported success would be claiming a repair it
 * did not make. Both it and `no-writer` exit non-zero and name the check.
 *
 * **`writer-failed` is a verdict about the TOOL, not the tree** — bean `i1q7`.
 * `translate-bpmn:bootstrap` printed "Nothing to do" and exited 2, and regen
 * reported `translate-bpmn:bootstrap:check` as "a real defect, not staleness"
 * while `--extract` fixed it in a second. A writer that refuses to run is not a
 * repair that failed; it is a writer that is not a writer, and saying so points
 * the reader at `package.json` rather than at the artefact.
 *
 * ## The whole gate set by default — bean `i1q7`, item 3
 *
 * This command asked only the FAST set (the jobs that install no browser),
 * borrowing `bun run gates`' inner-loop boundary. That boundary is about the
 * cost of `playwright test`, which regen never runs: it asks only verify/write
 * PAIRS, and outside the fast set there were exactly two — `render:bpmn:check`
 * (3.7 s) and `bat:sync:check` (0.1 s, and it needs no browser at all; it sits
 * in the e2e job by placement). `render:bpmn:check` was stale after every
 * merge that brought a process change, measured four times on 2026-10-01, and
 * every time the line saying so was the "NOT covered" footnote. So the default
 * is the whole set now, and `--fast` keeps the old scope for a machine that
 * wants it. A browser-job check that cannot be repaired on a machine with no
 * Chromium is reported `no-browser` — could-not-determine, never green, and
 * never a claim that the tree is wrong.
 *
 * ## Speed — bean `xpcu`
 *
 * Asked serially this took ~25 minutes on a shared 4-CPU box. Two things now
 * cut that, and neither changes a verdict:
 *
 * - **Input-hash skipping** (`input-hash.ts`). A pair whose declared inputs,
 *   outputs and script sources hash to what was recorded at its last green run
 *   is not asked again — it cannot answer differently. A pair with no
 *   declaration, or whose inputs cannot be determined, is ALWAYS asked. The
 *   cache is local (`build/regen-cache/`, ignored by version control) and is
 *   off under `CI`, so CI asks every pair exactly as before. Each check that
 *   RAN and passed in a settled run is also recorded on its own, which is
 *   what lets the `gates` run that follows skip it — and a check `gates` saw
 *   pass on these inputs is skipped here too (bean `f017`, `pairSkip`).
 * - **A worker pool** (`task-pool.ts`). A pair whose CHECK declares
 *   `outputs: []` (it only reads) is asked beside other such pairs. Every
 *   WRITER runs alone — no check reading and no other writer writing — and
 *   writers run in pair order. A pair whose check has no declaration is a
 *   barrier: it runs alone and in order, exactly as before. Per-pair lines
 *   (`--explain`) print in the original order.
 *
 * Why concurrency cannot change a verdict: a pass that ran a writer is always
 * followed by another, and the run is reported settled only after a pass in
 * which NO writer ran, or whose writers repaired nothing and left the tree
 * measurably unchanged — so the final verdicts were all read from a tree no
 * writer changed (bean `14ve`'s fixpoint does the work).
 *
 * ## Asking only what a change can have affected — bean `94zs`
 *
 * Two more cuts, both selecting by the same FOOTPRINT (`changed-paths.ts`):
 * a pair's declared input/output globs, its scripts' import closure, its
 * `package.json` commands and `bun.lock` — what the input hash covers.
 *
 * - **`--changed <base>`** asks, in the first pass, only the pairs whose
 *   footprint meets a path changed since `<base>` (`git diff <base>...HEAD`
 *   plus the working tree and untracked files). A pair outside it reads what
 *   it read at `<base>`, so its answer there is its answer here — an
 *   ASSUMPTION about `<base>`, reported as `not asked` and never recorded in
 *   the hash cache as a green run. `merge:main` passes the merge's fork point,
 *   for the reason on `regenArgs` in `merge-base.ts`. Unlike the cache it
 *   needs no earlier run on this machine, and it works under CI.
 * - **The narrowed fixpoint.** Each pass after the first asks only the pairs
 *   whose footprint meets a path the previous pass ACTUALLY changed —
 *   measured by snapshotting `git` status before and after the pass, never
 *   taken from a writer's declaration. A pair not re-asked keeps the answer it
 *   gave from a tree identical on its footprint, so "settled" still means a
 *   pass that ran no writer.
 *
 * Neither ever skips a pair with no input declaration, a `{tracked}` pair
 * when anything changed, or a pair whose footprint or change set cannot be
 * determined. **The limit, measured 2026-10-05:** the wall time is set by the
 * `{tracked}` pairs (`kg:audit:all:check`, `skill:register:check`,
 * `kg:audit:check`), which read the whole tree and so run after any merge and
 * after any writer. Narrow declarations in `task-io.ts` are what let these
 * two cuts skip anything; each must be read first.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run regen                # ask every gate; repair what is stale
 *   bun run regen --fast         # ...only the fast set (no browser-job pairs)
 *   bun run regen --dry-run      # report what is stale, change nothing
 *   bun run regen --jobs 3       # pool size (default: CPUs - 1)
 *   bun run regen --no-cache     # ask every pair; neither read nor update the hash cache
 *   bun run regen --explain      # say, per pair, why it ran or was skipped
 *   bun run regen --changed <base>  # ask only pairs whose inputs changed since <base>
 *   bun run regen --max-passes 8 # raise the fixpoint bound (default: DEFAULT_MAX_PASSES)
 *
 * `--all` is accepted and is the default.
 *
 * Exit (one decision, in {@link exitCodeFor}):
 *   0  every pair is current or was regenerated, and the run SETTLED
 *   1  at least one check is `unrepaired` or `no-writer` — not staleness
 *   2  the run did not reach a fixed point: COULD NOT DETERMINE, never clean

/**
 * How many passes a fixpoint run may take before it gives up — bean `g5kt`.
 *
 * ## Why it is not 3, which is what it was
 *
 * A pass is reported settled only when it ran NO writer, so a cap of N admits
 * at most **N − 1** writer-running passes. 3 therefore allowed two, and that
 * is below the measured need: the merge sweep of 2026-10-04 found
 * `skill:register` wanting a THIRD writer pass before its chain settled —
 * `skill:register` writes artefacts that other writers read, and
 * `skill-registration.md` records the chain being three deep. Under the old
 * default that run could not converge, and (bean `g5kt` defect 1) said so
 * while exiting 0.
 *
 * ## Why it is a bound at all, rather than "until it settles"
 *
 * Two writers can undo each other — `regen-after-merge.test.ts` has the case
 * — and an unbounded loop over that pair never returns. The bound is what
 * turns a hang into a reported refusal.
 *
 * ## Why this number
 *
 * It is a SANE BOUND, not a derived one, and saying so is the honest version.
 * The derivable bound is the longest chain of writer-reads-writer among the
 * pairs, which this tool cannot compute: `task-io.ts` declarations are
 * partial by design (a pair with no declaration is always asked), so a
 * computed depth would be an underestimate presented as a limit. 6 admits
 * five writer passes — twice the deepest chain ever measured here — and
 * `--max-passes` raises it for anyone who hits it. A run that needs more says
 * so and fails, which is the state this is allowed to leave behind.

/**
 * Passes until one runs NO writer — or a BARREN one, whose writers repaired
 * nothing and measurably changed nothing — at most `maxPasses` — bean `14ve`.
 *
 * One pass asks each check once, in workflow order. When writer B's output is
 * an INPUT to check A and A comes first, A reads current before B runs, B then
 * changes A's input, and A is stale when regen exits. Measured on #1530:
 * "60 current, 2 regenerated, 0 unrepaired", then `audit:coverage:require-all`
 * failed in CI.
 *
 * So a pass that ran any writer is followed by another. Each check's FINAL
 * outcome is its last pass's, except that `regenerated` in an earlier pass is
 * kept over a later `current`, because the repair happened. The cap keeps two
 * writers that undo each other from looping for ever. The last pass still ran a
 * writer, so its results are reported as they are, not as settled.
 *
 * The same argument is what makes the worker pool safe: the settling pass ran
 * no writer, so every verdict it reports was read from a tree nobody was
 * writing.
 *
 * The cap is {@link DEFAULT_MAX_PASSES}; `--max-passes` raises it. A run that
 * reaches it returns `settled: false`, and that is a REFUSAL, not a pass —
 * see {@link exitCodeFor}.

 * - **exit 1, `no-writer`** — a check with no writer counterpart is a

 *   `i1q7` split `writer-failed` out for exactly this reason: a verdict about
 *   the TOOL is not a verdict about the tree.
 * - **any other code, or a signal** — regen itself failed, and the message
 *   described that as a measurement.
 *
 * **The abort was right in every case; only the recorded reason was wrong.**
 * That is the same shape as commit `732c17f65`, whose resolution was correct
 * and whose stated reason ("the pins diverged") was measured in a shallow
 * submodule and false — and it is why this is a named function with tests
