/**
 * The directories a SUBSCRIBED harness declares, resolved to the tree this
 * checkout holds for each — the seam through which a site build (or anything
 * else that walks declared directories) reads an instance that is not in the
 * tree. Bean `g8jp`, GAP 1 of a staged instance's cutover.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/subscribed-trees
 *
 * ## Why it exists
 *
 * Every consumer that publishes an instance's pages — `mount-instance-docs.ts`,
 * `compose-docs.ts` — walked the repository's TOP-LEVEL directories for
 * declarations. That answers "which instances are staged here", and nothing
 * else: the day a staged instance leaves for its own repository and is read
 * back by subscription, the walk finds no `<instance>/`, and `/<instance>/` stops being
 * published with exit 0. A declared instance publishing nothing, silently, is
 * the `dh4f` defect.
 *
 * So the question is asked of the DECLARATION instead: each subscription names
 * a substrate at a pin and the subgraphs it CHOSE; the substrate's own root
 * declaration (cached by `kg:subscribe`) says what each subgraph is; and
 * `kg:materialize` says whether its bytes are held. A directory read through
 * here is an ordinary declared entry whose files live under the part's
 * `tree/` instead of under `<instance>/<path>`.
 *
 * ## Three states, never two
 *
 * - `held` — materialised, and the bytes still hash to the record.
 * - `referenced` — a DETERMINED absence: the subscriber's gates refused it, and
 *   the record says so. Nothing to publish, and that is an answer.
 * - `could-not-determine` — chosen but never materialised, a record that does
 *   not read, bytes that no longer match, or a snapshot that is missing or not
 *   the pin's. Never rendered as an empty pass: a caller that publishes pages
 *   reports these and fails.
 *
 * A subgraph the subscription did NOT choose is referenced by design and is
 * not listed at all — choosing is the subscriber's decision, not a gap.
 *
 * ## Shared, not per-consumer
 *
 * One function, so the site build and the navbar (`harness-tiles.ts`) cannot
 * disagree about which subscribed directories are held. A remote mount of a
 * declared directory pinned to a SHA (bean `0mpw`) lands at the same kind of
 * place — a tree for a declared entry — and reads through this seam.
