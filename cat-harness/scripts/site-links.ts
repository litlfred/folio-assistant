/**
 * Where the docs site's action tiles point — RESOLVED, never composed.
 *
 * Bean `udx8`, from the owner: *"in icon tile on top navbar, the graph view
 * icon does not work, goes to 404."* It did, and it had from the day the tile
 * was added.
 *
 * ## The defect, exactly
 *
 * `docs/_includes/head_custom.html` wrote the knowledge-graph tile's target as
 * `{{ '/kg/' | relative_url }}`, which on this site resolves to
 * `/folio-assistant/kg/`. **Nothing has ever been published there.**
 * `renderingPath` in `schemas/cat-harness.ts` says where an instance's
 * renderings actually land, and has said so since the layout moved off `kg/`:
 *
 * ```
 * <base>/<stub>.jsonld   the knowledge graph
 * <base>/<stub>/         the viewer
 * ```
 *
 * The href was a string somebody wrote by convention and checked against
 * nothing — the same defect `AGENTS.md` records against the README's chapter
 * PDFs, where all twenty-three links were 404 and always had been. A link
 * built by convention is a claim; only a link checked against the tree that
 * ships is evidence.
 *
 * So this module does two things and they are deliberately separate:
 *
 * 1. **`siteLinks()` computes the targets from the declaration** through
 *    `artefactStub` and `renderingPath` — the same functions the exporter and
 *    the workflow use, so the tile cannot disagree with what is published.
 * 2. **`verifySiteLinks()` checks each one against a BUILT TREE.** The
 *    generator is not trusted on its own; a path is `ok` because a file is
 *    there, not because the arithmetic looked right.
 *
 * ## "Could not determine" is a third state
 *
 * An absent or unreadable site directory yields `unknown`, never `ok` and
 * never `dead`. The CLI exits **2** for it, distinct from the **1** it exits
 * for a link it has positively established is broken. A checkout with no build
 * in it must not report a wall of dead links, and a watchdog that has gone
 * blind must not read as good news — the same rule `check-ci-health` and
 * `readme-links` already follow.
 *
 * An **external** link (the forge) is `unknown` too, always: nothing here
 * fetches the network, and reporting a URL as live because it is well-formed
 * would be exactly the composed-link claim this module exists to retire.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat-harness/scripts/site-links.ts                 # print the resolved targets
 * bun run cat-harness/scripts/site-links.ts --site _site    # ...and verify them against a build
 * bun run cat-harness/scripts/site-links.ts --json
 * ```
 *
 * @module scripts/site-links

/**
 * Anything whose destination can be checked against a built tree.
 *
 * **Split out of `SiteLink` so the CHECKER is not tied to the three navbar
 * tiles.** `verifySiteLinks` never reads anything tile-specific — it takes an
 * id, a target and a site directory, and answers `ok` / `dead` / `unknown`.
 * That is the general machinery this module exists to provide, and the
 * argument in the header ("a link built by convention is a claim; only a link
 * checked against the tree that ships is evidence") is not about tiles.
 *
 * The second caller proved the point and the type refused it: the QA
 * badges' `data-qa-index` and `data-qa-src` URLs are composed by the page
 * generator and were checked against nothing, and `scripts/tests/qa-results.test.ts`
 * could not verify them without inventing tile ids. `id` is a free-form label
 * here and stays a closed union on `SiteLink`, where it is a KEY that
 * `docs-ui.js` looks a tile up by.
