/**
 * Put each built page's OWN locale on its `<html>` element.
 *
 * Bean `zru7`. Measured 2026-09-27 by building the site rather than by reading
 * front matter: **70 of 70** translated pages were emitted as
 * `<html lang="en-US">`, and **none** carried a `dir` attribute — including the
 * Arabic ones. The source pages declare `lang: ar`, `lang: zh` and so on
 * correctly; nothing carried the declaration into the served document.
 *
 * That is WCAG 3.1.1 (Language of Page). A screen reader applies English
 * pronunciation to Chinese and Russian text, and `lang` is also what a browser
 * reads to choose fonts and hyphenation.
 *
 * ## Four locally checkable causes
 *
 *   1. The pinned theme's default layout emits
 *      `<html lang="{{ site.lang | default: 'en-US' }}">` — **`site.lang`, not
 *      `page.lang`** — and no `dir` attribute anywhere in its layouts or
 *      includes. Verified by downloading the gem the `remote_theme` pin names
 *      and reading it; `page.dir` appears nowhere in it.
 *   2. This repository has no `docs/_layouts/`, so nothing overrides that.
 *   3. `docs/_config.yml` declares no `lang:`, so `site.lang` is undefined and
 *      the `en-US` default wins for every page in the site.
 *   4. `docs/assets/js/docs-ui.js` sets `lang` and `dir` on `<html>` at `init()`
 *      — but only INSIDE its RTL branch. So `ar` is repaired at runtime while
 *      `es`, `fr`, `ru` and `zh` are never repaired at all.
 *
 * So the damage was not uniform, and the split is the point: 14 Arabic pages
 * were eventually right and wrong until `init()` ran, while 56 others were
 * permanently wrong, JavaScript on or off.
 *
 * ## Why a post-build pass and not a layout override
 *
 * **This repository has already decided this class of question**, and the
 * reasoning is written on `strip-preview-seo.ts`: the tag lives in the REMOTE
 * theme's layout, *"suppressing it at the source would mean vendoring that file —
 * which is the upstream-coupling hazard each folio's Jekyll config pins the theme
 * to avoid. A pass over the emitted tree couples to nothing."*
 *
 * `docs/_config.yml` says the same thing from the other side at length: the pin
 * exists because an upstream rename *"degrades a shipped feature silently rather
 * than loudly"*, and moving it is a whole documented process with a person in it.
 * A forked `_layouts/default.html` would be a hundred lines of somebody else's
 * file going stale the next time that pin moves, for the sake of two attributes.
 *
 * Widening the runtime patch was the other candidate and is rejected on the
 * bean's own grounds: JavaScript cannot fix first paint, and cannot fix a reader
 * who has it switched off. The language has to be in the served bytes.
 *
 * ## It reads the page's own declaration, so it couples to nothing at all
 *
 * Every page already carries a `fa-translation-meta` JSON block — the pipeline
 * emits it and `docs-ui.js` reads it — whose `lang` is the page's own locale.
 * This pass reads that and rewrites the `<html>` tag. No index, no URL-to-file
 * mapping, no knowledge of the theme: a page states its language and this makes
 * the document say so.
 *
 * A page with no meta block is LEFT ALONE and counted. Most of the site is not a
 * translation, and rewriting a page that has not declared a locale would be
 * inventing one.
 *
 * Idempotent: a second run finds every tag already correct and writes nothing.
 *
 * `tools` is the graph typology this audits — the subject is the emitted site, which
 * is harness output rather than any folio's content. Declared rather than
 * inferred, per `3srh`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/set-html-lang.ts --site ./_site
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/set-html-lang.ts --site ./_site --check
 *
 * @covers tools
 * @graphNode tool
