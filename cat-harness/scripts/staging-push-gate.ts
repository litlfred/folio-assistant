/**
 * Rate-limit staging-preview pushes to `gh-pages`, so a push never lands while
 * the Pages build it would cancel is still running.
 *
 * @module scripts/staging-push-gate
 * @covers none — a GATE the deploy waits on, not an audit: it decides when the stage job may push, and judges nothing else
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat-harness/scripts/staging-push-gate.ts gate --dir pages --queued-at "$QUEUED_AT"
 * bun run cat-harness/scripts/staging-push-gate.ts comment --state queued --dir pages --out body.md
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why this exists — issues #1868 and #1956, bean `j27s`
 *
 * GitHub's `pages build and deployment` keeps only the NEWEST run: every push
 * to `gh-pages` cancels the build in flight. A build takes about three minutes
 * (successful runs on 2026-10-03 took 2m20s to 3m40s), and staging previews
 * were pushed every one to two minutes in a busy stretch — 07:50Z to 08:00Z
 * that day, ten builds cancelled in a row. A main-site publish pushed into
 * that stretch was cancelled with them and stayed unpublished until a quiet
 * gap came.
 *
 * **Owner ruling, 2026-10-03, option 1:** push staging previews to `gh-pages`
 * less often — batched or rate-limited. This is the rate limit.
 *
 * ## The rule, and why it is enough
 *
 * Before each push attempt the stage job re-reads `gh-pages` and asks this
 * script whether the TIP is old enough:
 *
 * - tip is a staging commit (`staging(...)`): wait until it is
 *   {@link STAGING_WINDOW_MS} old — longer than a Pages build, so that build
 *   finishes before the next staging push can cancel it;
 * - tip is anything else (the main-site publish, `publish.yml`, any other
 *   publisher): wait until it is {@link MAIN_WINDOW_MS} old. Those are the
 *   builds this exists to protect, and the commit is made minutes before the
 *   push completes on a full-site replace, so they get the wider margin.
 *
 * **The fast-forward check is what makes it a guarantee and not a hope.** Two
 * stage jobs that both find the window open both build a commit on the SAME
 * tip; only one push can fast-forward, and the other is rejected, re-reads, and
 * finds a tip younger than the window. So at most ONE staging push lands per
 * window, however many jobs wait — no lock, no shared state, nothing to
 * expire. The same rejection protects the main site: a staging push racing a
 * main-site publish either lands BEFORE it (and is harmless, because the main
 * push then cancels the staging build, and the build that runs carries both)
 * or is rejected and waits out the main-site window.
 *
 * ## Why not a single "flush" job instead
 *
 * The alternative was to have each stage job upload its preview as an
 * artifact and a scheduled job push every pending preview in one commit. It
 * batches harder, but it costs a second workflow, an artifact round trip of
 * 200–500 MB per preview, a record of which artifact is already deployed, and
 * a schedule GitHub only runs best-effort — and the flush job would hold a
 * write token over content built from a pull request, which no job here does
 * today. The rate limit is one script and one loop, and its safety argument
 * is git's own fast-forward rule.
 *
 * Coalescing still happens: the workflow's per-branch concurrency group has
 * `cancel-in-progress: true`, so a job waiting here is cancelled by the next
 * push to the same branch, and a superseded preview is never pushed at all.
 *
 * ## Exit codes of `gate`
 *
 * - `0` — the window is open; push now.
 * - `75` (`EX_TEMPFAIL`) — the window was closed; this script SLEPT until it
 *   should open (plus jitter, so waiters do not wake together) and the caller
 *   must re-read `gh-pages` and ask again. Sleeping here rather than printing
 *   a number is `backoff-sleep.ts`'s reason: a failure is then an exit code,
 *   never an empty `sleep` operand.
 * - `1` — the job has waited longer than {@link MAX_WAIT_MS}. Something is
 *   pushing `gh-pages` continuously; the preview is NOT deployed and the job
 *   fails, because a lost staging deploy must stay visible.
 * - `2` — usage, or the tip could not be read. Never read as "open".
