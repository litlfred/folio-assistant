/**
 * Slices 5 and 6 copy a CHOSEN subgraph, or one asset, of a subscribed
 * substrate into the subscriber. The writer is `kg:materialize`, and it
 * lives in the content layer rather than here for one reason: its record embeds core's
 * `MaterializationSchema`, and this instance needs only bootstrap, so a
 * writer here would import up the dependency arrow (`check:partition`).
 *
 * What lives HERE is what the readers below core need without importing up:
 * where a part's bytes and record sit, how a tree is digested, and a
 * STRUCTURAL view of a record that the subscriptions page draws from. One
 * layout, stated once, read by the writer, its `--check`, that page and
 * `check:materialized-fixity`.
 *
 * ## The layout
 *
 * Under the subscriber's own `substrate-snapshot` directory — the same place
 * the snapshot is cached, because a materialised part is the same layer:
 * somebody else's bytes at the pin, written by a command, never by hand.
 *
 * ```text
 * <snapshot dir>/<subscription>/subgraphs/<subgraph id>/materialization.json
 * <snapshot dir>/<subscription>/subgraphs/<subgraph id>/tree/…      the upstream directory's contents
 * <snapshot dir>/<subscription>/assets/<upstream path>/materialization.json
 * <snapshot dir>/<subscription>/assets/<upstream path>/tree/<file>
 * <snapshot dir>/<subscription>/nodes/<subgraph path>/nodes.json
 * <snapshot dir>/<subscription>/nodes/<subgraph path>/index.hydrated.jsonld
 * ```
 *
 * `nodes/` is the METADATA mode (`kg:materialize --nodes`, bean `c1m4`): the
 * subgraph's published `index.hydrated.jsonld` and a `nodes.json` record with
 * its sha256 — graph metadata, no bytes of the subgraph itself. No `tree/`,
 * because the part is one file and the record never hashes itself; and the
 * directory nests (`nodes/skills/` may hold `nodes/skills/sdlc/`), because a
 * subgraph path is a path, so a fetch of a parent never disturbs a child.
 *
 * The bytes sit under `tree/`, apart from the record, so a digest over the
 * tree never has to exclude the record that carries it, and so a scanner can
 * be told "do not read upstream's own files as ours" with one directory name
 * (`check:materialized-fixity` honours it: upstream's materialization records
 * describe upstream's checkout, not this one).
