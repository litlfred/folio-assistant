/**
 * A stray backtick inside a viewer's page template, named as what it is.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-viewer-backticks
 * @covers docs
 * @graphNode none — a gate, not a schema
 *
 * ## Why a check rather than a fifth warning
 *
 * Four generators build a whole HTML page as ONE template literal, and each
 * carries a comment saying NO BACKTICKS BELOW THIS LINE. A backtick anywhere
 * inside terminates the string, and the rest of the page becomes TypeScript.
 *
 * The comments have not worked. It has happened four times in
 * `gen-schema-viz.ts` alone — twice in prose quoting a field, once quoting an
 * intake's files[], once quoting a bean id — and every time in a COMMENT,
 * which is the one place the author is not thinking about string syntax.
 *
 * The parser already catches it, so this is not about letting a defect
 * through. It is about the MESSAGE. Measured by planting one in the real file
 * and running both:
 *
 *     compiler:  error: Expected ";" but found "whbf"
 *     this gate: gen-schema-viz.ts:833 - a backtick here closes the page
 *                template early, so everything after it is parsed as
 *                TypeScript.
 *
 * Note what is NOT wrong with the compiler's answer: the line number is
 * right. The file's own warning says the failure lands far from the mistake,
 * and on this evidence it does not. So the case for a gate is narrower than
 * the warning implies, and it is only this — the compiler names a token and
 * says nothing about backticks, template literals, or the warning three
 * hundred lines above. An author who does not already know the trap reads it
 * as a syntax error in the code they just wrote.
 *
 * ## How it decides, without parsing
 *
 * It cannot parse: the file does not parse, which is the whole situation. So
 * it reads text. The template opens at `return <backtick><!doctype html>` and
 * is meant to close immediately after the page's final `</html>`. The first
 * unescaped backtick after the opening is therefore the close — and if the
 * text just before it is not that closing tag, the literal ended early, and
 * where it ended is exactly where the stray backtick is.
 *
 * That is a check on the ONE thing that matters rather than a backtick
 * census: a backtick before the opening (a doc comment, an import) is fine
 * and must stay fine, or the gate becomes something to work around.

 * **Derived, and bean `57n3` is the reason it could not be before.** This was
 * an array of four paths, and the honest note on it said so: deriving the set
 * found twelve files, and the old detector reported two of them — both
 * compiling — as defects, because it took the first unescaped backtick as the
 * close and did not follow `${…}`. The array therefore encoded a
 * PRECONDITION: its members obey their own NO BACKTICKS warning absolutely,
 * which is what made the naive scan sound on them.
 *
 * {@link endOfTemplate} follows interpolations now, so the precondition is
 * gone and the list with it. Measured after the fix: all seven generators
 * report clean, and a backtick planted in a comment inside each one's page is
 * still found — including in the two that could not be scanned at all before.
 *
 * **Tests are excluded by shape, and that is measured rather than tidy.**
 * `scripts/tests/check-viewer-backticks.test.ts` carries a PLANTED stray at
 * line 28 as a fixture; scanning it would fail the gate on its own evidence.
 * The `.e2e.ts` files report clean today, so they are excluded for the other
 * reason: a test is not a generator, and a gate that watches fixtures reports
 * on pages nobody ships.
