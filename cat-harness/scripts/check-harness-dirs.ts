/**
 * The harness's two stores are declared in two files. This is what keeps them
 * from disagreeing.
 *
 * `harness.config.json`'s `harness` block is where a folio STATES where its work
 * plan and workflow state live. `.beans.yml` is what the `beans` binary
 * actually READS — it is a third-party tool and does not know
 * `harness.config.json` exists. So the same path is written twice by necessity,
 * and two configs that can drift is precisely the defect this repository has
 * paid for repeatedly.
 *
 * The duplication is not the problem; an *unchecked* duplication is. This makes
 * a disagreement a build failure on the day it is introduced rather than on the
 * day somebody's beans silently go to a second store.
 *
 * ## What it checks
 *
 * 1. `harness.workPlan` equals `beans.path` in `.beans.yml`.
 * 2. `harness.workflowState` is what `workflow/store.ts` compiled in.
 * 3. Neither path is dot-prefixed at its first segment — the whole point of the
 *    move is that a person can see them.
 * 4. The declared work-plan directory exists and holds beans.
 *
 * ## Third state
 *
 * A folio with no `harness.config.json`, or with no `harness` block, is **not** a
 * failure: the schema defaults are the answer, and a folio that has not opted in
 * is reported as `not configured` rather than as wrong. Exit 2 is "could not
 * check" and is never rendered as a pass — same rule as `check-ci-health.ts`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run check:harness-dirs
 *   bun run check:harness-dirs -- --json
 *
 * Exit: 0 consistent (or not configured), 1 a real disagreement, 2 could not check.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-harness-dirs
 * @covers cat-harness, beans
