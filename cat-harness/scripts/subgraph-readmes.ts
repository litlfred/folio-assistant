/**
 * A README for every declared directory — cat-harness's call into the
 * writer in bootstrap-tools.
 *
 * @module scripts/subgraph-readmes
 * @covers cat-harness
 *
 * The writer, its Liquid templates and its findings are
 * `bootstrap-tools/scripts/subgraph-readmes.ts` — one copy, in the tools
 * repository (owner, 2026-09-29, bean `xsqm`). What stays here is what only
 * a harness knows:
 *
 * - **resolving its Extensions** before the writer sees a directory: a
 *   directory entry `scope: "repository"` is relative to the repository
 *   rather than the instance, one declaring `absent` may be missing, and an
 *   asset's README is found through {@link declaredAssetPath}, which honours
 *   the asset's scope too;
 * - **resolving the governing process** a directory declares in
 *   `coverage.process` (owner, 2026-09-29: *"show highlevel (sub)process bpmn
 *   on the uploads page"*). The name, the diagrams and the site each diagram
 *   renders into are all things this harness's declaration knows and
 *   bootstrap's does not, so {@link governing-process} resolves them here and
 *   the writer is handed a finished `ProcessView`. `check-subgraph-coverage`
 *   shares that resolver, so the page and the axis cannot disagree about
 *   whether a declaration points at anything;
 * - **recording the findings** as the committed QA sidecar
 *   `test/results/subgraph-readmes.qa-results.json`. Reported, not failed: a
 *   gap in a declaration is its owner's to fill, and failing on it would block
 *   every commit on a backlog. What `--check` FAILS on is a stale README, or
 *   a declared directory newly absent / a process newly unresolved against a
 *   baseline (bean `0dav`: the committed working copy until QA results leave
 *   `main`, `--against <ref>` after; a missing baseline is UNKNOWN and not
 *   gated). It used to fail on a stale sidecar, which has no subject once the
 *   sidecar is not committed. A `qa` or `health` directory that is not in the
 *   checkout is not `absent-directory` either: those kinds leave `main`.
 *
 * Usage: `bun run readme:subgraphs` · `bun run readme:subgraphs:check`

 * What each SUBDIRECTORY of `abs` is, by name — read from the directory's own
 * declaration file, the one its graph kinds name as `declarationFile` (the
 * owner's rule, 2026-09-20: each type declares its own filename, so
 * relocating `beans/` to `work/` renames nothing inside it).
 *
 * Only entries WITHOUT `"subgraph": true`. Those are parts of this
 * directory's graph (`beans.json`'s `defs`), and they are what the README's
 * table names; a `subgraph: true` entry is promoted to an instance directory
 * of its own (`skills.json`'s `voices`) and describes itself under its own
 * heading. The two partition, so a promoted directory's row borrows nothing.
 *
 * Only a single-segment `path` names a row — `defs/archive` is a directory
 * inside a row, not one. A missing, unparseable or description-less
 * declaration supplies nothing and the row says nothing declares it (no
 * count since bean `ba9e`):
 * absent stays absent rather than being invented. An unparseable file is
 * `check:harness-dirs`'s finding, not this one's.
