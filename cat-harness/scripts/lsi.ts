/**
 * Latent Semantic Indexing over the declared knowledge graphs — build a
 * per-graph index sidecar, query it, check it is fresh, and audit which graphs
 * need one.
 *
 * @covers library, skills, beans, folio, docs, methodology, memory, policies, glossary
 *
 * Method: `methodologies/lsi.md`. Engine: `content/pipeline/lsi.ts`. Skill:
 * `skills/kg/graph-management/lsi-indexing.md`.
 *
 * ## Subcommands
 *
 *   bun run lsi index  [--instance <name>] [--graph <id>] [--doc <slug>…] [--k N]
 *   bun run lsi query  "<text>" [--instance <name>] [--graph <id>] [--doc <slug>…] [--top N]
 *   echo "<text>" | bun run lsi query --instance <name> --graph <id>   # the Tool node's form
 *   bun run lsi audit  [--strict]      # which graphs need an index; is each fresh?
 *   bun run lsi links  --instance <name> --graph <id> [--per N] [--top N]   # cross-document proposals
 *
 * ## What is committed, and why not the vectors
 *
 * The sidecar under `cat-harness/test/results/lsi/<instance>/<graph>.lsi.json`
 * carries the input fingerprint, the parameters, the retained variance, the
 * top-loading terms at each pole of the first dimensions, each unit's nearest
 * neighbours, and two kinds of finding. It does NOT carry `U` or `V`: a
 * rebuild is about a second at this corpus size, and a multi-megabyte float
 * dump is not something a reviewer can judge. What a reviewer CAN judge — do
 * the dimensions make sense, are the neighbours plausible — is what is kept.
 *
 * ## The need-an-index rule, and its basis
 *
 * A graph NEEDS an index when it holds at least `NEED_UNITS` text units and
 * `NEED_WORDS` words. **Basis: a house threshold, not from the method.** The
 * 1990 paper gives no corpus-size rule. The two numbers encode the case the
 * method exists for — more prose than one reader holds in a sitting, so a
 * change of vocabulary between two units goes unnoticed — and they are here,
 * named, so a reviewer can move them. Below either threshold the result is
 * `n/a`, not `pass`: a small graph was not judged to be fine, it was not
 * judged.
 *
 * ## With no index directory in the checkout
 *
 * The sidecars and their run records are derived QA bound for the
 * `qa-reports` branch (arc `3fva`, owner rulings D1/D4, bean `oq1j`). When
 * `test/results/lsi/` is absent, {@link graphVerdict} REBUILDS the index in
 * memory and judges that run, writing nothing (proposal §2.3: compute and
 * judge): fresh by construction, or failed. It never reads the absence as
 * "has none", and never as a pass it did not compute. A reader that wants the
 * STORED indexes (the viewer page) fetches them by ref and passes them in as
 * an {@link IndexSource}.
 *
 * It REPORTS by default (exit 0 with findings), like `check:methodology-
 * evidence`; `--strict` fails on a needed-but-missing or stale index.
