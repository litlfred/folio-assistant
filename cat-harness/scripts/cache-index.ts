/**
 * What is materialized here, how big, how old — and what could go.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cache:index          # summary, then eviction candidates
 *   bun run cache:index --all    # every materialized copy
 *   bun run cache:index --json
 *
 * Bean `54rk`. `freshness()` answers *"is this copy stale"* for ONE record.
 * Nothing answered the question a person asks before materializing anything
 * else: **what do I hold, what does it cost, and what is safe to drop** —
 * across the whole set.
 *
 * ## Derived, never stored
 *
 * Every row comes from the `materialization` records the corpus already
 * carries, found by the SAME walk `check:materialized-fixity` uses
 * (`collect()`). A cache index kept as its own file would be a second answer
 * to "what is here", free to disagree with the first.
 *
 * ## Three states per column, and which one each value is in
 *
 * - **size**: `recorded` (the record's `bytes`), `measured` (the file at
 *   `localPath`, stat'ed now), or absent. A measured number is labelled so,
 *   because it answers "how big is it now", not "how big was it when landed".
 *   A DIRECTORY record is not summed: its parts are materialized records of
 *   their own, and adding both would count every byte twice.
 * - **fetched**: the record's `materializedAt`, or `not recorded`.
 * - **last read**: always `not recorded`. Nothing records reads. Owner,
 *   2026-09-23, choosing among "say not recorded", "add a field" and "use the
 *   file's access time": **say not recorded**. atime is disabled on many
 *   mounts and reset by a checkout, so it would look precise and mean nothing.
 *
 * ## Eviction REPORTS and never acts
 *
 * `deletion-requires-confirmation`: the tool lists candidates with their
 * sizes and reasons, and a person decides. Its worked example (`plj1`) is a
 * workflow whose shape deleted every open PR's preview with nobody deciding.
 * An ARCHIVAL copy is never a candidate: it exists to outlive its source.
 *
