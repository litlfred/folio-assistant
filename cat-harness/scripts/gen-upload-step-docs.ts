/**
 * gen-upload-step-docs.ts — the reference page for document ingestion's FIRST
 * step, generated from the Tool nodes that implement it.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-29: *"generate documentation from Tool documentation of the
 * upload Task/Skill as first step of document ingestion process."*
 *
 * ## Why the page could not be generated before the other three layers existed
 *
 * The chain it asks for is `process step → skill → Tool → page`, and its first
 * link was missing. `document-ingestion.bpmn` began at an EVENT — *"a file
 * lands in `uploads/`"* — so the process started after arrival; the ingest
 * Tools both type their first input as *"the upload to ingest, under the
 * declared `uploads` graph"*, a file already present; and `document-intake`
 * triggers on a drop that has happened. Nothing modelled the act of putting a
 * file there, so there was no Tool documentation for a page to be generated
 * FROM. `Task_Place`, the `upload-routes` skill and the `upload-url` Tool are
 * the three links this generator needed.
 *
 * ## Nothing about WHICH step is written here
 *
 * The process file is named and everything else is DERIVED from it: the start
 * event, the activity its only outgoing flow reaches, that activity's
 * `<bootstrap.processes:skill ref>`, and every Tool whose `satisfies` names
 * that skill. So inserting another step ahead of `Task_Place`, renaming it, or
 * pointing it at a different skill moves the page rather than staling a
 * literal — and a step that stops naming a skill fails the run instead of
 * producing a page about nothing.
 *
 * It IMPORTS both graphs rather than parsing them, for the reason
 * `gen-tools-viz` gives: the Tools are authored as TypeScript calling
 * `defineTool` precisely so a malformed one fails at `tsc`, and the diagram
 * has an interpreter. A generator with its own weaker readers would be free to
 * disagree with the ones the server uses.
 *
 * ## What it refuses rather than papers over
 *
 * - the named process file missing, or its start event flowing nowhere;
 * - a first activity naming no skill, or naming more than one (the page would
 *   have to pick, and picking is a judgement a generator may not make);
 * - **no Tool satisfying that skill.** An empty page reads as "this step has no
 *   mechanism", which is a finding, not a document — and it is the state the
 *   whole chain was in until today, so emitting it silently would be the one
 *   failure this generator exists to have made impossible.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/gen-upload-step-docs.ts
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/gen-upload-step-docs.ts --check
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/gen-upload-step-docs
 * @covers tools, processes
