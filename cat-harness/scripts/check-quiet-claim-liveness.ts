/**
 * The NETWORK half of `bean-quiet-claims` — bean `thux`, which measured it by
 * hand and said it is not computable in the health check.
 *
 * `bun run health` reports quiet claims from ONE signal: hours since the bean's
 * own `updated_at`. Its threshold `basis` is explicit that the resulting count
 * is an **UPPER BOUND**, because a bean it lists may have a liveness signal the
 * sweep cannot see. `bean-coordination.md` §"A quiet claim" names the three:
 *
 *   > A claim is LIVE when something outside the bean says so — an open PR
 *   > naming it, an unmerged branch touching it, or a note since.
 *
 * The first two are here. The third is the `updated_at` the check already reads.
 *
 * **This script never changes a bean's status**, and that is a rule rather than
 * an omission. The same skill: *"quiet is never evidence of completion, so a
 * quiet claim goes back to the pool rather than being closed"*, and *"nothing
 * re-statuses one automatically"*. What a person does with the list is take an
 * item, having said in the bean that they checked.
 *
 * **A pull request that MENTIONS a bean counts as a signal, and that is a real
 * limitation rather than a bug.** `bean-coordination` states the signal as "an
 * open PR naming it", so naming is the test. Measured on the first real run of
 * this script: `q2wm` came back live on PR #1347 — which is the pull request
 * that ADDED this script, and named `q2wm` in a list of work still to come. A
 * reader who follows the signal finds a mention, not a session. Narrowing it
 * would mean ruling on what a PR has to say about a bean to be working it, and
 * that is a judgement this sweep has no business making silently; the ref and
 * PR number are printed so a person can look.
 *
 * Exit codes follow `check-head-has-run`: **0** however many findings, because
 * a quiet claim is a fact about the repository rather than a defect in it, and
 * **2** when a signal could not be established — an unreachable API or an
 * unmeasurable ref age is NOT reported as "no signal found", which would turn
 * could-not-look into the shape of nothing-was-there.

 * merge-base with `origin/main`:
 *
 *     27 refs change  1     3 refs change 4     1 ref changes 11
 *     11 refs change  2     1 ref changes 7     1 ref changes 30

 * checked by reading their diffs rather than inferred from the count, and both
 * are path-rewrite sweeps: `peaceful-heisenberg-dzgsf1` rewrites

 * `cat-bootstrap-rename` rewrites `bootstrap/` to `cat-bootstrap/` across 30.
 * Neither is a claim on any bean it touches.
 *
 * Getting this wrong manufactures liveness, which is the failure mode that
 * matters here: a false signal EXCUSES a claim nobody is on, so the sweep would
 * quietly report the work plan as healthier than it is. The first version of
