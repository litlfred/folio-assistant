/**
 * A bean that declares a block must say when it goes stale — ENFORCED.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-bean-blocks
 * @graphNode none — a checker over the `bean-defs` graph
 *
 * ## What was already here, and what was missing
 *
 * Almost all of this existed. `scripts/beans.ts` carries `readBeans`,
 * `hasExpiry` and `beanFindings`, and `beanFindings` already emits
 * **`blocked-without-expiry`** — firing on 4 of the 4 beans that hold a
 * relation-block. This module imports all three rather than restating any:
 * two answers to "where are the beans" or "does this bean state an expiry"
 * would be two answers free to disagree, which is the defect this repository
 * keeps paying for.
 *
 * **What was missing is that nothing FAILS.** `beanFindings`' only consumer is
 * `gen-docs-pages.ts`, which publishes it to a docs page. A finding that
 * reaches a page nobody is required to read is a finding with no teeth, and
 * `blocked-without-expiry` firing on 100 % of its subjects for as long as it
 * has existed is what that looks like.
 *
 * ## And the reason compliance was zero: the prescribed form did not parse
 *
 * `bean-blocking.md`'s worked example said to write **`status: blocked`**.
 * That status does not exist — `beans update --help` accepts *"in-progress,
 * todo, draft, completed, scrapped"*, and `BeanStatusSchema` is the same five,
 * describing itself as *"Exactly what `beans update --status` accepts"*.
 *
 * Measured over the 99 in-progress beans on `main`, 2026-09-22: **0** carried
 * `expires`, **0** carried `status: blocked`, **4** asserted a block
 * structurally (a `## Blocked on` heading, invented independently by those
 * four), and **26** used blocking language in prose only. A prescribed form
 * the tool refuses is a rule with a **0 % compliance ceiling**. Bean `zldg`.
 *
 * ## What this gates, and what it deliberately only reports
 *
 * | shape | treatment |
 * |---|---|
 * | a `## Blocked on` section | **ENFORCED** — all four fields or the gate fails |
 * | a relation-block with no expiry (`beanFindings`) | surfaced on every run |
 * | blocking language in prose only | counted, never failed |
 *
 * **Prose is not gated, and that is not timidity.** The corpus contains
 * *"page wiring is genuinely blocked"* beside *"this unblocked `68dt`"* and
 * *"the block was re-measured and is still real"* — one asserts a block, one
 * retracts one, one reports on another's. A gate firing on the word would go
 * red on beans that are not blocked, and **a gate nobody can keep green is a
 * gate that gets switched off** — the argument `check-secret-leaks` used to
 * reject entropy scanning on this same corpus.
 *
 * So the structured form is enforceable and the prose is visible. That split
 * is the point: it gives a block a way to be checkably stale, without
 * pretending to adjudicate the ones that are not.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run check:bean-blocks
 *   bun run check:bean-blocks --list   # ...and name every unstructured bean

/**
 * Blocks declared before this gate existed.
 *
 * Same mechanism and the same file shape as `bean-parents-baseline.json`, for
 * the same reason: a gate that lands RED on `main` gets switched off, and a
 * gate switched off is indistinguishable from one that passes (`1xhc`). The
 * two entries it carries are the stream 2 and stream 3 consolidation claims
 * (issue #956), which declare a genuine block on the owner and predate the
 * four fields.
 *
 * REPAIRING THEM IS NOT THE CHECKER-AUTHOR'S TO DO. `expires` is a date
 * somebody has to choose and `handoff` says what happens when it passes;
 * both are judgements about somebody else's block. `bean-blocking.md` already
 * draws this line for an external block — `cz17` waits on WHO, and no agent
 * may invent WHO's date — and a sibling stream's claim is the same shape.
 *
 * The file may only SHRINK: an entry nothing matches is reported stale and
 * fails, so a repair cannot leave a licence behind.
