/**
 * The harness data a FOLIO's own site serves, scoped to that folio (#2263).
 *
 * The owner's words, and the site they were said about, are on issue #2263 and
 * in the `harness-tiles` skill: an IG repository's own site showed the
 * PLATFORM's bean and todo counts, and its bean and todo links 404'd. This
 * module names no instance -- the platform does not know its dependents.
 *
 * ## What went wrong
 *
 * An IG repository's own site (the IG-repository site template) is built
 * inside the platform's chrome: `compose-docs.ts
 * --shell` copies the platform's `_data/` and `assets/`. Two of those are not
 * chrome at all — they are PROJECTIONS OF THE PLATFORM'S OWN GRAPHS:
 *
 * - `_data/harness.json` — the tiles (with the platform's baked counts: beans
 *   916, todos 3), the navbar icon row, the rail's folders and scopes, the
 *   harness rows, the site's title. Every path in it is ROOT-relative to the
 *   PLATFORM's site (`/beans/`), so on `/<folio>/` it resolves to
 *   `/<folio>/beans/`, which does not exist.
 * - `assets/<graph>/count.json` and `index.json` — the platform's bean and
 *   todo indexes, which the icon row's badges fetch from the page's OWN site.
 *   So the folio's rail showed the platform's 537 open beans.
 *
 * `_includes/generated/` was already blanked in a shell for the same reason
 * (#2235 F1); these two were the same kind of thing and were not.
 *
 * Two more of the same kind outlived that fix (the #2263 follow-up):
 *
 * - `_data/translation-qa.json` and `_data/translations.json` — the platform's
 *   translation sweep and translation index. Every folio page's title badge
 *   read the sweep as its own site's ("Swept 49/689"), and with a locale
 *   chosen the index rewrote the folio's own Home link to `/<folio>/fr/`,
 *   which 404s: the index's paths are the platform's pages.
 * - `fsh-guts`. Its icon was re-based to the platform's page as a link, but on
 *   a page that loads `docs-ui.js` the icon is a BUTTON whose count is
 *   fetched from `<this site>/fsh-guts.json` -- which a folio's site does not
 *   publish -- so it showed "?", an error, where the truth is "absent".
 *
 * ## The rule this applies
 *
 * **A page's tiles describe the instance whose site the page is on.**
 *
 * - A tile, icon or folder over a graph the FOLIO declares stays, and resolves
 *   on the folio's own site (`/<instance>/x` → `/x`).
 * - A tile over a **`state`** graph the folio does not declare (beans, todos,
 *   QA, health, uploads …) is NOT borrowed: no link and no count. State is a
 *   fact about one instance's work, and another instance's number is not this
 *   folio's — `zero` would be a lie too, because the folio has not said
 *   (`schemas/tile-count.ts`: absent is a third state). The icon row says why
 *   in words (`harness-tiles` §"An inert row SAYS why").
 * - A tile over the PLATFORM's content, context or derived graphs (skills,
 *   processes, tools, schemas, docs …) is re-based to the platform's
 *   published site, absolute, with its qualifier SHOWN so it reads as the
 *   platform's — and its count dropped, because a count beside another
 *   site's link is still another instance's number on this page.
 * - A kind this module cannot classify is treated as state: the
 *   conservative direction, since a missing link is visible and a wrong
 *   number is not.
 *
 * **No root-relative path survives.** Every href leaves here either
 * absolute on the platform, or as a path inside the folio's own root.
 *
 * **The same rule binds a FIGURE that is not a tile.** A badge or count the
 * chrome reads from the page's own site describes the folio or is not shown:
 * the host's data behind it is left out of the shell
 * ({@link HOST_DATA_PROJECTIONS}), and the chrome is told, in
 * `foreignSite.absent`, what to SAY instead of a number. Absent is not zero.
 *
