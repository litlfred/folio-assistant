/**
 * How the library viewer shows a block row, and a WITHHELD entry's banner.
 *
 * @module scripts/lib/library-withheld-view
 *
 * Issue #1794, owner ruling 2026-10-01 (option 1 of 4, "fix the viewer now"):
 * each row shows the section's summary when one exists; otherwise
 * "Withheld — copyright not granted" with a link to the catalogue record; and
 * a banner at the top of a withheld entry says why.
 *
 * Measured before (PR #1799): both withheld who-iris entries — 121 and 250
 * blocks — rendered every row "(no content carried)". That sentence is TRUE of
 * a page-scan with no text and FALSE of a refused work, whose text is held
 * here and deliberately not published. A reader could not tell "nothing was
 * extracted" from "not ours to show", which is the distinction bean `cw35`
 * kept the entry listed in order to make.
 *
 * ## Three row outcomes, in this order
 *
 * 1. **A summary with text** — shown, labelled as a summary and never as the
 *    source text. Our writing about the work stays published for a withheld
 *    entry (owner, 2026-09-24: "Fix, keep summaries").
 * 2. **A withheld entry** — the gate's own words ("copyright and restrictions
 *    not granted"), read from the entry's `withheldBy.gates`, and a link to the
 *    catalogue record: its published page when there is one, else its upstream
 *    URI, else no link rather than a guess.
 * 3. **Anything else with no content** — the neutral "(no content carried)",
 *    unchanged, because for those it is the truth.
 *
 * **Withheld is READ, never inferred from emptiness.** The flag comes from
 * `withheld.json` through `library-graph.ts`; an entry whose rows happen to be
 * empty is case 3.
 *
 * ## Why a string of browser code rather than TypeScript
 *
 * The viewer is a single static page with an inline script (see
 * `viewerHtml`). These functions are that script's, embedded verbatim, and
 * kept here so a unit test can evaluate the SAME text the page runs — with
 * `esc`, `summaryPanel` and `SITE_ROOT` supplied — instead of a re-typed copy
 * free to disagree with it. `String.raw`, so a `—` reaches the browser as
 * the escape it is. No `${` inside: it is not interpolated, and must not be.
