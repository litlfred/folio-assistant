/**
 * ONE NAME PER DESTINATION — the single source of every navigation label.
 *
 * @module scripts/lib/nav-label
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-01, bean `ob3m` finding 6, choosing option 1 of 4, **"One
 * name everywhere"**: each destination gets ONE label, used identically on
 * every surface (the viewer rail, the Jekyll sidebar, FOLDERS, the landing's
 * "visualisations you can open", the glass tiles and More panel, the Stickies
 * "Visualisations" row). Where the harness matters the surface APPENDS the
 * harness as a qualifier, "Skills · C@T Harness", and never uses a different
 * base name.
 *
 * Measured before, on PR #1762's head: 42 destinations across six surfaces, of
 * which 10 carried two or more names. The rail and the sidebar printed the
 * bare KIND word (`docs`, `methodology`, `external-schema`). The glass printed
 * the tile's declared title ("Docs — cat-harness", "Methodologies"), or the
 * directory id when none was declared (`root-docs`). Two kinds that share a
 * page (`schemas` and `cat-harness`, both drawn by the schema viewer) were two
 * names for one page. A harness with no folio of its own (`bootstrap`) linked
 * a graph's viewer and so named `/processes/` "Bootstrap".
 *
 * ## Where a label comes from
 *
 * Only declarations. Nothing on this page is a per-surface string.
 *
 * - **A harness** is its declared `title`, else its `name` ({@link harnessTitle}).
 * - **A kind's destination** is the kind's registered display name
 *   ({@link kindTitle}). Where several kinds of one instance share a page,
 *   every one of them takes the name of the kind its directory declares
 *   FIRST: `schemas/` declares `["schemas", "cat-harness"]`, so both rows say
 *   "Schemas" ({@link labelVisualisations}).
 * - **A tile** is its declared title when the declaration gives one, with any
 *   harness suffix removed ({@link stripQualifier}), else the display name of
 *   the directory's first kind ({@link tileLabel}).
 *
 * The client renders what this module wrote into `_data/harness.json` and
 * never recomputes it. A second implementation in `docs-ui.js` would be two
 * answers free to disagree, which is the defect itself.
 *
 * `check:nav-names` (`scripts/check-nav-names.ts`) is the gate. It reads every
 * generated surface it can read statically and fails when one destination
 * carries two base labels.
