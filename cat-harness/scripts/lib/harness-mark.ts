/**
 * A harness's navbar MARK, read one way by every surface that draws it.
 *
 * Bean `2vpn`, owner 2026-10-04: *"who-iris is missing top icon on LHS navbar
 * … all needs to be consistent and consolidated"*. who-iris DECLARED a mark —
 * its open-book glyph in WHO blue, since the owner removed its emblem on
 * 2026-09-23 — and the header drew the letter "W" on every page anyway. Two
 * defects composed:
 *
 * - `harness-tiles.ts` resolved a navbar mark only from a theme card or a
 *   declared `icon`, so a glyph-only instance had no `mark` at all;
 * - the mounted and viewer pages read the row's `icon` rather than its `mark`,
 *   so even a THEME avatar never reached them — only an instance with a
 *   declared `icon` (cat-harness) ever drew an image there.
 *
 * Three readers each converted a row by hand (`gen-navbar-include.ts`,
 * `mount-instance-docs.ts` twice), which is how one of them drifted to `icon`.
 * This module is the conversion; `harness-tiles.ts` is the resolution. A
 * reader that builds a {@link NavItem} from `harness.json` calls
 * {@link navMarkFields} and adds nothing of its own.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/lib/harness-mark
