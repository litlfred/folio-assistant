/**
 * Wrap text in a Liquid `raw` block so Jekyll emits it verbatim.
 *
 * ## Why a helper and not two `push("{% raw %}")` lines
 *
 * A raw block ends at the FIRST closing tag Liquid sees, wherever it sits — a
 * code span, a fence, prose explaining raw blocks. A skill that wrote the
 * closing tag literally ended its page's raw block early; everything after it
 * was parsed as Liquid and the staging build died with
 * `Liquid syntax error: Unknown tag 'endraw'` on the generator's own trailing
 * tag (bean `kjbb`, noted in `a9tx` §HANDOVER). Both generators that wrap
 * authored text (`gen-skill-docs`, `gen-processes-viz`) had the same shape.
 *
 * ## The escape
 *
 * Each `{%` that opens a closing tag is replaced by: close the raw block, emit
 * `{` from a Liquid string, reopen the raw block, then the literal `%`. The
 * rendered output is byte-identical to the input. Checked against Ruby Liquid
 * 5.14 in strict mode; the tempting `{{ "{%" }}` form does NOT parse, because
 * Liquid's tokenizer sees the `{%` inside the string as a tag opener.
