/**
 * Split DECLARED directories into those on disk and those not — and say so.
 *
 * Bean `95ir`. A scanner that ends its resolution with `.filter(existsSync)`
 * drops a declared-but-absent library without a word, then reports a clean run
 * over the libraries that remain: the `dh4f` shape, one step removed.
 *
 * The owner's ruling, 2026-09-23: **fail in CI for declarations, not for
 * instances.** The DECLARATION half is `check:declared-dirs`, which runs in CI
 * and fails on every declared directory not on disk (verified by moving
 * `who-iris/library/` away: `absent — declared and not on disk`, exit 1). A
 * SCANNER is the instance half and must not fail on it — a new folio's library
 * is absent until its first ingest — but it must not be silent either. So an
 * absent directory is reported here, in its own words, distinct from "empty":
 * an empty directory that exists is a determined empty; a declared path with
 * nothing there is a different fact.
