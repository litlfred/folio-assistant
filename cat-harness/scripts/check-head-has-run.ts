/**
 * Does this commit have a CI run at all?
 *
 * @module scripts/check-head-has-run
 *
 * Bean `3pqn`. **A pull request carrying ZERO checks renders identically to
 * one whose checks have not started yet** — both are an absence of status. An
 * agent or a person who merges on "nothing red" merges unverified, and the
 * repository has no way to tell them apart from a checkout.
 *
 * That is the `xom7` shape one layer up: a workflow failing invisibly, where
 * the remedy was to make the state legible rather than to trust somebody would
 * notice.
 *
 * ## Measured, twice, in two different shapes
 *
 * The bean recorded two cases on 2026-09-19 (`#340` head `e0e3b4b8`, `#349`
 * head `059cf9e1`): force-push, then open the PR seconds later, and no
 * `pull_request` run ever fired. Waiting ~45s made it go away, so it read as a
 * race between the ref update and `pull_request.opened`.
 *
 * **That framing is too narrow, and this repository produced the
 * counter-example on 2026-09-20.** On `#518`, already open, with no
 * force-push and no PR being opened:
 *
 * | commit | pushed | `pull_request` run |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `f93582e52b` | 13:16:18 | yes |
 * | `cbfd048a1d` | 13:23:46 — **448s later** | **none, ever** |
 * | `f9cb1ee08f` | 13:24:12 — 26s after that | **none, ever** |
 *
 * Re-queried hours afterwards across all forty `pull_request` runs on the
 * branch: neither appeared. So a `synchronize` can be dropped too, seven and a
 * half minutes after the previous push — no race to lose — and **the later of
 * two rapid pushes is not a safe assumption either**, because it was dropped
 * as well. The checks had to be produced by hand with `workflow_dispatch`.
 *
 * ## What this can and cannot do
 *
 * It cannot make GitHub deliver an event. It can say **"this commit has no
 * run"**, which is the fact nobody could see. Three states, and the third is
 * why the script exists at all:
 *
 * | state | means | exit |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | has the owed runs | every workflow OWED for the event ran | 0 |
 * | **missing a required run** | it has runs, but not the ones owed | 1 |
 * | **no run** | GitHub answered, and nothing names it | 1 |
 * | could not ask | no remote, no network, rate limited, HTTP error | 2 |
 *
 * **Could-not-ask is never reported as "has a run"**, and never as "no run"
 * either: telling somebody their commit is unverified when you simply could
 * not look would train them to ignore it, which costs more than the gap.
 *
 * ## "Has a run" was the wrong question — bean `9x9r`
 *
 * Until 2026-09-24 the first row read *"at least one workflow run names this
 * exact `head_sha`"*, and the script decided on `runs.length > 0`. Any run.
 * Any workflow, any event. The header was honest about what it measured; the
 * QUESTION was wrong, because the operator running this is asking whether
 * **their PR's gates** fired.
 *
 * Two live cases, both measured that day:
 *
 * | head | its runs | old verdict |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | PR #1309 | `JSON-LD drift` twice — one `push`, one `pull_request` | ✓ |
 * | PR #1222 `28f929a` | `Code-quality gates` via **`workflow_dispatch`** only | ✓ |
 *
 * The second is the worse one and it indicts the fix as much as the defect: a
 * dispatch resolves `refs/heads/<branch>` rather than the merge ref, so that
 * green was about a different tree (`yv4z`, `sddf`) — and this script endorsed
 * it. `3pqn` reported as clean, by the file written to detect `3pqn`.
 *
 * The owner ruled the stronger of two fixes on 2026-09-24: **derive the owed
 * workflows from `.github/workflows/`** rather than match per-event, so a gate
 * workflow that is renamed or deleted is caught too. The required set is read
 * by {@link scanTriggers}; the reasoning, and why a path-filtered workflow is
 * `conditional` rather than required, is in `src/core/workflow-events.ts`.
 *
 * ## "No run" is not one situation — bean `sddf`
 *
 * Exit 1 is the same either way, because the operator's immediate position is
 * the same: **nothing verified this head**. But WHY differs, and one of the
 * reasons used to get advice that made things worse. So the no-run branch now
 * asks {@link mergeStateForHead} and says which of these it is:
 *
 * | why | what it means | what to do |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | **conflicted** | the forge publishes no `refs/pull/N/merge`, and a `pull_request` run checks that ref out | merge the base in. **Never dispatch** |
 * | mergeable | a run is owed and its absence is unexplained — this is `3pqn` | dispatching is safe here |
 * | not a PR head | no open PR has this sha, so nothing was owed | open the PR, or ask about the right head |
 * | unknown | the probe itself failed | check by hand; assume nothing |
 *
 * **The conflicted row is why this was a defect and not a wording nit.** The
 * old message said *"this is bean `3pqn`: the event was dropped"* and told the
 * reader to dispatch. A dispatch resolves `refs/heads/<branch>`, not the merge
 * ref — so on a conflicted PR it is a green signal for a tree that will never
 * exist, which is worse than the absence it replaces. `yv4z` established that
 * and `prepare-merge` §Guardrails gained a step 0 for it; this script, the one
 * an operator actually runs at that moment, did not get the memo.
 *
 * It also stated a cause as fact two sentences before admitting the evidence
 * could not distinguish it — the `xom7` shape, inside the file written to
 * prevent it, and the second time this file has done that (see the hazard
 * section below).
 *
 * A run for a DIFFERENT commit is not a run for this one, and that distinction
 * is the whole check: in both of the bean's cases the branch *did* have a
 * recent run — for the commit the previous PR had merged.
 *
 * ## A push does not buy you a run, and `mergeable_state` does not buy you an answer
 *
 * Two things measured 2026-09-25 (bean `fx5r`), both of which change what an
 * operator standing at a runless head should DO.
 *
 * **Pushing to a PR's head branch does not re-run its `pull_request`
 * workflows.** A merge commit was pushed to an open PR's branch and only the
 * `push`-triggered workflow fired:
 *
 * ```
 * 17:04  success  JSON-LD generated-file drift   57fd738d8  (event=push)
 * 04:54  success  Code-quality gates             5a02ac4b5  (event=pull_request)
 * ```
 *
 * The head then carried ONE green check and not the one that mattered — this
 * script's own subject, `3pqn`, arrived at from the other side: not zero
 * checks, but the wrong subset, which reads as green at a glance. So
 * "push something to trigger CI" is not a remedy; `workflow_dispatch` against
 * the branch is, and the table above is right that it is safe only while the
 * PR is mergeable.
 *
 * **`mergeable_state` is not the way to check by hand.** It, `head.sha` and
 * `updated_at` all kept serving a PR's pre-merge view 45 minutes after that PR
 * merged; only `merged` went stale-safe. Worse, `update-branch` answered
 * *"merge conflict between base and head"* for a CLOSED PR, while
 * `git merge-tree` and a real `git merge --no-commit` both reported zero
 * unmerged paths — a wrong cause stated with the authority of a measurement.
 *
 * This module already had the right instinct: {@link mergeStateForHead} asks
 * `git ls-remote origin refs/pull/N/merge` rather than the field. The advice it
 * PRINTED in the `unknown` case did not, and pointed at `mergeable_state`
 * twice. That is fixed; the rule is the one `h2s9` arrived at independently —
 * **when a forge API and git disagree about git, git is the subject and the
 * API is a cache.**
 *
 * ## The hazard this script could itself have become
 *
 * A commit id GitHub has never heard of returns an empty run list, which is
 * indistinguishable from a real commit whose event was dropped. The first
 * draft reported `deadbeef…` as "has NO workflow run of any kind" — a
 * confident wrong answer, which is the exact failure this file exists to
 * prevent, reproduced inside it.
 *
 * So the id is resolved against the local repository FIRST: unknown here is
 * `cannot-ask`, not a finding. And a commit that exists locally but sits on no
 * remote ref genuinely has no run and always will, so it is reported with THAT
 * as the reason rather than implying GitHub lost something.
 *
 * Usage:  bun run check:head-has-run [<sha>]
