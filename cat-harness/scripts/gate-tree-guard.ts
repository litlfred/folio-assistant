/**
 * Which gate CHANGED THE REPOSITORY while it was being judged.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists for
 *
 * `bun run gates` runs its gates in order, and the FIRST is `bun test`; somewhere
 * in that suite the detangle WRITER runs and repairs
 * `test/results/detangle/**.detangle.json`. `kg:detangle:check` is near the end,
 * ~1140 lines of output later, and it reads the file the first gate just
 * repaired. (No count here on purpose: this said "152 gates" while the set was
 * 170, and the gap between the two is the argument.)
 *
 * Measured on one tree with `internal` deliberately stale (bean `ymsu`):
 *
 *     bun run kg:detangle:check   alone      ->  exit 1, "STALE … — internal"
 *     bun run gates               same tree  ->  exit 0, "152 gate(s) pass"
 *
 * The checker is not broken — run alone it catches the defect exactly as
 * designed. What is broken is that inside `gates` its subject no longer exists
 * by the time it looks. All 28 pinned measurements sit in that blind spot, and
 * three separate artefacts reached `main` carrying wrong values through it.
 *
 * ## Why the answer lives in the RUNNER and cannot live in a gate
 *
 * No gate can observe what another gate did. That is not an oversight in any
 * individual check; it is the definition of the blind spot. Only the loop that
 * invokes them sees between them, so this is the one place the question can be
 * asked at all.
 *
 * It is also why this is the general fix rather than a fourth answer: it knows
 * nothing about detangle, about tile counts, or about dashboards. It would have
 * caught all three of `ymsu`'s instances, and the `327 -> 345` bean badge that
 * went stale again five beans later, without being told any of them existed.
 *
 * ## The predicate is NOT "the tree is dirty"
 *
 * Running `gates` on your own uncommitted work is the normal case — it is what
 * you do before pushing. A guard that failed on a dirty tree would be wrong and
 * hostile, and it would be switched off within a day.
 *
 * So the question is *"did a gate change a path it did not find changed when it
 * started?"* — a per-gate delta, never an absolute state. Your own edits are in
 * the baseline and stay there.
 *
 * ## Why this is green on a healthy tree, which is what makes it shippable
 *
 * A generator rewriting IDENTICAL BYTES does not show up in `git status`.
 * Measured 2026-09-26 on a clean `main`: a full `bun test` left the tree
 * byte-identical. So the guard fires exactly when a gate's write CHANGED
 * something — which is to say, exactly when a committed artefact was stale and
 * the gate that checks it was about to be handed the repaired copy.
 *
 * Cost, measured rather than assumed before choosing per-gate over
 * once-per-run: `git status --porcelain` over this repository's 13,529 tracked
 * files is **~29ms** (five runs: 29, 27, 29, 27, 29). At the 152 gates of the
 * day that was ~4.4s, and the conclusion does not depend on the count — it is
 * one snapshot per gate against a run of several minutes. So attribution — the
 * part that turns "the tree changed" into "the first gate changed what the last
 * one reads" — is nearly free.
 *
 * ## Raw porcelain lines are the key, on purpose
 *
 * Git quotes paths containing special characters and writes renames as
 * `R  old -> new`, so a parser that wants the real path has to unquote C-style
 * escapes and split on an arrow that may legally appear in a filename. None of
 * that is needed here: to notice that a snapshot CHANGED, the line git printed
 * is already a stable key, and to report it, the line git printed is already
 * what a reader wants to see. The only field read out of it is the two-char
 * status code, which is fixed-width and needs no parsing.
 *
 * A parser this code does not contain is a parser that cannot be wrong.
 *
 * ## Known limitation: do not CHANGE the tree while the gates run, by any means
 *
 * The snapshots are of the working tree as git reports it, so anything that
 * moves a porcelain line during a run moves the thing being measured, and this
 * code will attribute it to whichever gate happened to be running — a finding
 * that names an innocent gate.
 *
 * **Git operations are one way.** `git add` turns `??` into `A ` and ` M` into
 * `M `; a commit makes those entries vanish entirely. Found the honest way,
 * 2026-09-26: the session writing this guard wanted to commit it mid-run and
 * realised it would fabricate the finding it was trying to measure.
 *
 * **An ordinary write to a tracked file is another, and this section named only
 * the first until it fired that way.** Measured 2026-09-27: an agent appended a
 * paragraph to a bean file while a background `gates` run was in flight, and the
 * run ended *"every gate passed, and the run is NOT clean — 1 gate(s) changed
 * the tree"*, attributing ` M beans/defs/…-9v4m….md` to `bun test`. Nothing was
 * wrong with `bun test` and no git command had been run. The heading said
 * *"do not run git"*, the agent had not run git, and it read the finding as a
 * gate's defect before checking.
 *
 * The condition is therefore not "a git operation" but "a tree change from
 * outside the gate", and an editor write is the easier one to commit by
 * accident, because it does not feel like operating on the repository at all.
 *
 * It is documented rather than defended against, and the reason is that the
 * defence is worse than the disease. Detecting "did HEAD or the index move?"
 * means reading `.git/HEAD` and the index mtime between gates and deciding what
 * to do about a change — and the only safe answer is to void the run, which
 * hands every reader a could-not-determine in exchange for a case that only
 * arises when somebody edits the repository while judging it. Commit before the
 * run or after it.
 *
 * **Partly narrowed since bean `v3nf`.** The runner records when each gate ran,
 * and each changed path's mtime is checked against those windows: a write that
 * landed while NO gate was running is reported as an outside change rather
 * than pinned on a gate, and a write inside a parallel batch names only the
 * gates running at that instant. An outside write made DURING a gate still
 * names the gate — see {@link attributeWrite}.
