/**
 * check:derived-from — the edges between derived subgraphs resolve, form no
 * cycle, and respect the interim rendering order. Bean `nama`, step 2.
 *
 * `derivedFrom` (schemas/cat-harness.ts) names the declared directory ids a
 * derived graph is computed FROM. An edge nothing checks is prose, so this
 * gate gives it three refusals and one ratchet, per the owner's rulings of
 * 2026-10-04 (design note docs/proposals/derived-graph-dependencies-2026-10-04.md):
 *
 * - **Resolution.** An id resolves to the NEAREST instance that declares it:
 *   the edge's own instance first, then the instances it `needs`, closest
 *   first. Ids are not unique across instances (`library` is declared six
 *   times), so the instance picked is part of the answer and is printed.
 * - **An id declared nowhere** is refused.
 * - **An id declared only by an instance the edge's instance does not need**
 *   is a LAYERING GAP: the chrome case, where an IG's pages are styled by
 *   smart-base's chrome across no `needs` path. The owner ruled it a RATCHET
 *   (option 1 of 3). It is held in `derived-from.baseline.ts` with a reason; a
 *   new gap fails, and a cleared one leaves the baseline stale until shrunk.
 * - **A cycle** is refused.
 * - **The interim order** (the owner's rule: declaration order is rendering
 *   order until a topological order is computed). A directory whose source is
 *   declared AFTER it in the same instance is refused, because it would render
 *   from a stale source.
 *
 * - **A dangling `writer`** is refused: the staging cone reads a directory's
 *   generator from it (bean `4j86`), and a path that does not exist would
 *   silently shrink the cone rather than fail.
 *
 * - **The storage clock** (bean `0b8c`, #2230). A derived artefact can be
 *   current in a commit only if every input it is computed from — directly,
 *   or through the `derivedFrom` edges upstream — is itself kept in the
 *   commit. An input kept on a BRANCH (a `source` or `storage` that is not
 *   the checkout) moves without a commit, so a committed artefact derived
 *   from it is stale the moment somebody writes there, on main and on every
 *   open PR at once. That was measured: the fsh-guts viewer, committed on
 *   main while `fsh-guts/` lives on `cat/cat-harness/fsh-guts`, went red
 *   everywhere on one `state:push` (2026-10-05). So:
 *   - a TRACKED artefact with a branch-kept input is refused
 *     (`committed-from-branch`): it must be built at publish instead;
 *   - a publish-time visualisation that names no `writer` is refused
 *     (`publish-without-writer`): `derive:publish` would have nothing to run.
 *   A visualisation is derived from the directory it visualises — the edge
 *   is implicit, because a viewer of X is computed from X by definition.
 *   "Kept on a branch" is read from the COMMITTED declaration; a per-checkout
 *   source override is a local choice and does not change what every
 *   checkout shares.
 *
 * And one ADVISORY count: directories in the `derived` layer that name no
 * `derivedFrom`. Absent means "not declared", and a `library/` is derived from
 * an external publication, not from a graph. Making silence fail needs a field
 * for "why not", which is the owner's call, so it is reported, not graded.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/check-derived-from
 * @covers none — it judges directory declarations, which no graph typology holds
