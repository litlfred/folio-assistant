/**
 * render-selection.ts — which render steps must actually run, and why.
 *
 * @module scripts/render-selection
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-20, bean `9c34`:
 *
 * > new skill for staging rendernig.... dont rerender the whole thing... if
 * > main render is not stale, copy that to staging render pipleine as cahche.
 * > trigger rerender only on assets that have changed and downstream depndent
 * > index.
 *
 * Three steps, and the bean is explicit that the third is the whole thing:
 * seeding is a cache, diffing is a diff, and **re-rendering what DEPENDS on
 * what changed is a dependency graph.** Getting that wrong fails in the
 * direction nobody notices — *a page that was not re-rendered looks exactly
 * like a page that was*, which is `xom7` moved into the render.
 *
 * ## The two edges, and why one mechanism expresses both
 *
 * The bean asks for both to be expressible:
 *
 * | edge | example | one change means |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | **projection** | `ingestion-notes.html` ← `iris-dspace.md` | one source file → one page |
 * | **index** | `community-list.html` ← every catalogue node | one MEMBER → the whole index |
 *
 * They differ in what a reader should expect, and **not** in what the runner
 * must do: in both cases, if any declared input changed, the step re-runs and
 * its own `--check` decides which outputs actually differ. So `inputs` is one
 * mechanism, and the distinction lives in the declaration a human reads.
 *
 * **The downstream half needs no new mechanism at all.** `needs` already says
 * which steps run after which, so a step whose dependency re-ran must re-run
 * too. That is the cascade, and it is the same edge the pipeline already
 * declares for ordering.
 *
 * ## Staleness is DETECTED, never assumed
 *
 * A seed is trustworthy for a step only if the inputs that produced it are the
 * inputs present now. So a render writes a MANIFEST — per step, a hash over
 * the content of its declared inputs — and a later build compares. Three
 * outcomes, and the third is the one that matters:
 *
 * - hashes match → the seeded output stands, the step is skipped;
 * - hashes differ → the step runs, and so does everything that needs it;
 * - **the manifest is missing, unreadable, or does not mention the step →
 *   the step RUNS.** Never "assume fresh". A partial render presented as
 *   complete is the failure this module exists to prevent, and it is exactly
 *   the third state this repository keeps everywhere else: *could not
 *   determine is never rendered as clean*.
 *
 * A step that declares NO inputs also always runs, for the same reason: it has
 * not said what it reads, so nothing can be concluded about whether its output
 * is current.

 * runtime happens to carry: it sorts `README.md` after `a/skills`, and a
 * different ICU version may not. A hash whose input order can vary by
 * platform is a hash that mismatches between the machine that wrote a seed
 * and the one reading it — which fails in the safe direction (a needless full
 * render) and is still wrong. Codepoint order is the same everywhere.
