/**
 * Which BPMN diagram a GitHub workflow implements, and which node each of its
 * jobs is — read from the WORKFLOW.
 *
 * A workflow depends on the process it carries out, so the workflow holds the
 * pointer and the diagram names none of its implementations (data-modelling
 * step 8, #1168 B5). Until bean `61ca` the diagram carried
 * `<…:implements workflow="…"/>` and `<…:job name="…"/>`: nine arrow-direction
 * findings, and a process that had to be edited whenever a new workflow
 * implemented it.
 *
 * Two comment lines, because YAML has no other place a GitHub workflow will
 * accept an unknown key:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * # bpmn: cat-harness/processes/ci-health-watch.bpmn
 * jobs:
 *   report:
 *     # bpmn-node: Start_Sweep
 * ```
 *
 * - `# bpmn: <path>` at column 0 — the diagram, repository-relative, because
 *   `.github/workflows/` sits at the repository root and a path has one
 *   spelling from there. More than one line is allowed and each is read.
 * - `# bpmn-node: <id>` INSIDE a job — indented deeper than the job's key,
 *   before the next job. A comment above a job key is prose about that job,
 *   and attributing it by proximity is the near-miss that reads right in every
 *   example; containment is the rule `declaredJobs` used for the same reason.
 *
 * A comment is read line by line, not by the YAML parser (which drops it).
 * That is sound here because both lines are anchored: column 0, or inside the
 * `jobs:` block under a two-space job key — the shape every workflow here has.
 *
 * @module scripts/workflow-bpmn
