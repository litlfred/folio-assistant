/**
 * Carry the open PRs' `STAGING/` previews across a full-replace `gh-pages` deploy.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists for — bean `plj1`
 *
 * `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` with `keep_files: false` and no
 * `destination_dir` does exactly this at push time (its own
 * `src/git-utils.ts`, `setRepo`):
 *
 * ```
 * git clone --depth=1 --single-branch --branch gh-pages <remote> workDir
 * git rm -r --ignore-unmatch '*'      # ← everything on the branch, STAGING included
 * cp -R publish_dir/* workDir/
 * ```
 *
 * `docs-site.yml` is the ONLY `gh-pages` publisher in this repository without
 * `keep_files: true` — measured against all six, 2026-09-19 — and it is the one
 * that fires on every push to `main` touching `docs/`, `processes/`,
 * `schemas/` or four scripts. So the most frequently run publisher was the only
 * one that wiped, and what it wiped was every open PR's review preview.
 *
 * Measured on the real `gh-pages` history, 2026-09-19 — every `docs(gh-pages)`
 * commit in the window deleted every preview its own parent carried:
 *
 * | deploy | previews on parent | previews after |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `a9c58f8ec` | 1 | 0 |
 * | `498edc4d1` | 3 | 0 |
 * | `d98ad6c82` | 1 | 0 |
 *
 * It is silent: the staging push succeeds, the bot comments the URL on the PR,
 * the check run is green, and an unrelated merge to `main` removes the artefact
 * minutes later. A reviewer following the link gets a 404 with nothing anywhere
 * saying why — and `AGENTS.md`'s merge discipline turns on staging being the
 * place a human assesses a rendered artefact.
 *
 * ## Why not `keep_files: true`
 *
 * Because `keep_files` is not path-scoped and the action offers nothing that
 * is — its `action.yml` has `keep_files`, `force_orphan` and `exclude_assets`,
 * and `exclude_assets` filters the SOURCE directory, not the branch. So
 * `keep_files: true` would also stop the main site's own deleted pages from
 * ever disappearing: rename a doc and both the old and the new URL serve
 * forever, and nothing would ever report it.
 *
 * Restoring `STAGING/` into the publish directory keeps both halves: the main
 * site is still a full replace, so a removed page goes; the previews are part
 * of what is published, so they stay.
 *
 * ## "Could not determine" is a third state, and it is the important one
 *
 * An unreadable `gh-pages` must NEVER render as "there are no previews to
 * keep" — that reading deploys the wipe this module exists to stop. Four
 * outcomes, and only the first three are allowed to continue:
 *
 * - **`restored`** — the branch was read and carries previews; they are now in
 *   the publish directory.
 * - **`empty`** — the branch was read and carries none. A determined empty.
 * - **`no-branch`** — the branch positively does not exist (first deploy).
 *   `git ls-remote --exit-code` says so with exit 2, which is distinct from a
 *   failure.
 * - **`unknown`** — the branch could not be read. Exit **2**, which fails the
 *   deploy step on purpose, the same way `translation:index` fails it rather
 *   than publish a navbar whose translation set could not be determined.
 *
 * ## `--verify`, because a green run proves nothing here
 *
 * The action re-clones `gh-pages` itself at push time, so there is a window of
 * a few seconds between this restore and that clone in which a
 * `feature-staging` deploy can land a preview that the push then removes. That
 * window is seconds against the whole of every deploy before this change, but
 * it is not zero, and a loss inside it would be exactly as silent as the defect.
 *
 * So the restore records what it restored (`--state`), and `--verify` re-reads
 * the branch afterwards and exits non-zero naming any preview that did not
 * survive. A new preview pushed in the window is ADDED, never missing, so the
 * comparison has no false positives. `unknown` there is exit 2 again — a
 * verifier that has gone blind must not read as a pass.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat-harness/scripts/restore-staging.ts --site ./_site --state ./.staging-state.json
 * bun run cat-harness/scripts/restore-staging.ts --verify --state ./.staging-state.json
 * ```
 *
 * @module scripts/restore-staging
