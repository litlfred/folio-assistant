/**
 * Append an entry to the render log on the publish branch.
 *
 * @module scripts/render-log
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-20: *"log all staging rendering (when added, when deleted)
 * to a logging directory/file on gh-pages."* This is the tool half; the
 * discipline is in `skills/folio-core/render-logging.md` and the process is
 * `processes/staging-render-log.bpmn`.
 *
 * ## APPEND, and nothing else
 *
 * There is no `--remove`, no `--edit`, no `--id` to overwrite. A takedown is
 * an `removed` ENTRY, not the erasure of the `rendered` one before it. That
 * is what makes the never-delete rule structural here rather than a guard
 * three separate cleanup paths have to remember: the tool offers no verb that
 * could lose history, so no caller can be written wrongly.
 *
 * Emptying a log is a person's decision, taken deliberately, with the same
 * confirmation every durable artefact here requires
 * (`deletion-requires-confirmation`). It is not something this tool does.
 *
 * ## Why it writes into a directory rather than pushing
 *
 * `--dir` is a checkout of the publish branch, or a publish directory about
 * to become one. The tool never fetches, commits or pushes: the workflows
 * that call it already hold a `gh-pages` checkout with their own retry and
 * concurrency handling, and a second pusher racing those would be a new way
 * to lose a deploy. One job knows how to push; this one knows what to write.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   render-log.ts --dir DIR --event rendered --kind staging-preview \
 *     --path STAGING/slug [--slug S] --summary "..." [--reason "..."] \
 *     [--branch B] [--commit C] [--run URL] [--detail "..."]

/**
 * Prose does not travel in argv — bean `ru6i`.
 *
 * `--summary` and `--reason` used to be command-line words. The reason for moving
 * them is the CONTRACT, and it is worth being exact about that, because the first
 * version of this comment claimed a live bug that does not exist.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT THE REASON. I claimed the four callers in `feature-staging.yml`
 * were broken by a quote in `$CLEANUP_REASON`, since they built the argument as
 * `--reason "PR #... confirmed by: $CLEANUP_REASON"`. **Measured: they were
 * safe.** Shell parameter expansion inside double quotes does not re-tokenize or
 * re-quote, so `he said "no"`, a backtick and a `$(id)` all arrived as one
 * literal argument with nothing executed. The value comes through `env:`, which
 * is a shell variable — not a `${{ }}` template substitution, which would be a
 * different story.
 *
 * THE ACTUAL REASON. `tool-types.ts` refuses prose as an argv word by design: "no
 * pattern admits real markdown and excludes a payload … a tool whose prose
 * argument is a command-line word was always going to need quoting nobody
 * checks." So `render-logging` could not have a Tool node at all while its
 * summary was a flag — `check:tools` said exactly that:
 *
 *     ✗ 1 command-line input(s) of a type that can express a shell payload:
 *         render-log.summary : Text — put free text on stdin
 *
 * That rule is about what a TYPE can express, not about today's callers: its own
 * argument is that "a caller is one refactor away from a template literal", and
 * the property that survives a careless caller is the value never being
 * dangerous. So this is a defensive change and a contract change, not a bug fix,
 * and calling it a bug fix would have been a claim nobody could check.
 *
 * The flags are REFUSED rather than quietly ignored, and that part stands on its
 * own. A caller left behind by the migration fails at exit 2 naming the flag,
 * instead of writing a log entry with an empty summary — which would be a record
 * that something was published and not what.
