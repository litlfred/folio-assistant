"""Assemble and RENDER the vector figures on a PDF's caption pages. Bean `ay3x`, under `m4xy`.

`pdf-vector-labels.py` (bean `a8wy`) records every positioned text line on a
page that declares a figure, and stops there on purpose: it does not group.
This arm is the step above it, which the owner ruled on 2026-10-03 -- *"Yes,
build it."* It does two things and one refusal:

  1. ASSEMBLY. The page's drawing primitives are grouped into connected
     components, the labels are placed in the component and the closed shape
     that contain them, and every open stroke is related to the labelled
     shapes its two ends land in. Recorded as structure, not as prose.

  2. RENDER. The union of the label-bearing components is rendered to a PNG
     beside `images.json`, so a person or agent can LOOK at it -- `a8wy`
     demonstrated on Annif's Figure 2 that a labels-only reading gets every
     noun right and every relation wrong, so the render is the part that makes
     an account possible rather than an inventory.

  3. THE REFUSAL: THIS SCRIPT NEVER ASSIGNS A ROLE. Every entry is written with
     `role: "undetermined"` and a basis naming THIS SCRIPT as what looked
     (`method: "assembly"`). Whether a region is a figure or furniture is the
     call `m4xy` refuses to make with a number -- *"a threshold chosen after
     seeing this corpus is a number chosen to fit the answer"* -- and `j820`
     measured that no geometric rule separates the classes across 29
     documents. So the call is made by looking, and it arrives through
     `apply-image-verdicts.ts` as an `inspection` basis naming who looked. A
     silently placed image is the `d5f1` defect; an image placed with a role
     nobody assigned is the same defect with better manners.

Every rule below is STRUCTURAL -- a fact about the drawing, never a tuned
number:

  * Two primitives belong to one component when their rectangles touch or
    overlap (closed intervals, so a zero-height rule touching a box counts).
    No gap tolerance: a tolerance would be a number fitted to this corpus.
  * A drawing whose rectangle covers the whole page is a page background and
    joins nothing; otherwise it would merge every component on the page.
  * A label belongs to the SMALLEST component, and the smallest closed shape,
    whose rectangle contains the label's centre. A label inside none is kept
    as `between` -- `a8wy` found 30 real figure labels on DIIG page 25 sitting
    in the white space between drawn boxes, so dropping them is not an option.
  * An open stroke's end attaches to a labelled shape when it lies inside that
    shape's rectangle grown by the stroke's OWN half-width -- the one length
    the drawing itself supplies. An end inside none is recorded as `null`, not
    snapped to the nearest shape: nearest-always-wins asserts a relation the
    drawing did not draw.

The region rendered is a stated convention, not a verdict: the bounding box of
every component holding at least one label. It may include page furniture (a
footer band with the page number inside it is a labelled component), and it
may EXCLUDE figure text that sits in white space beyond every drawing --
`9789240010567-eng` page 25 titles its three architectures above the boxes.
Both directions are the figure-vs-furniture call this arm refuses, so the crop
is never widened or narrowed by a guess: `assembly.outside` counts the lines
it leaves out, and the inspector, who is shown the page, says what is missing.

Never claims absence it did not establish: no backend, or a document that will
not open, yields `figures: null` with a reason -- NOT an empty list.
