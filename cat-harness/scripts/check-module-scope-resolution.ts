/**
 * check-module-scope-resolution.ts — no module scope resolves the folio
 * directory, because a throw there is an error far from its cause.
 *
 * ## What this forbids, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * `const FOLIO_DIR = folioDir(ROOT);` at module scope. `folioDir` throws on a
 * malformed declaration, and a throw during evaluation ABORTS the module —
 * leaving every export below the failing line unbound. `await import()` can
 * then hand back the half-built namespace rather than re-throwing, so the
 * error a reader sees names an unrelated binding's temporal dead zone.
 *
 * Bean `95s1` is what that costs: `qa-checkers-extended.ts` threw at line 49,
 * `EXTENDED_AUTOMATED_CHECKERS` at line 3235 was never bound, and the symptom
 * sat **3,186 lines** from the cause — close enough to a circular import that
 * the bean was opened as one and stayed wrong until the import graph was
 * actually measured.
 *
 * **`findContentRepoRoot()` at module scope is NOT flagged.** It no longer
 * throws: it catches `folioDir` failures while searching and ends in a
 * declared fallback (PR #695). Flagging it would be a gate against a hazard
 * that no longer exists, and this file would be the place a reader learned a
 * false thing about it.
 *
 * **Lazy call sites are not module scope**, so `FOLIO_DIR: () => folioDir(x)`
 * inside an object is fine and stays fine — `adapters/document/paths.ts` has
 * one deliberately.
 *
 * ## The fix a finding points at
 *
 * `folioDirDeferred(root, import.meta.url)` — resolves at load, exactly as
 * before, so a value captured under the loading cwd stays captured; only the
 * THROW waits for a caller, and arrives naming the module.
 *
