/**
 * Does a path-filtered workflow rebuild when the scripts it RUNS change?
 *
 * A `paths:` filter is a hand-maintained list, and this repository already has
 * the measurement saying that is not enough. `docs-site.yml` carried eight
 * named scripts, each added with a comment arguing — correctly — that a change
 * to that generator changes the published page while touching nothing under
 * `docs/`. The argument was right every time and the list still drifted: on
 * 2026-09-21 bean `tyyc` derived the set and found **11 of 22 uncovered**,
 * including `kg-export.ts`, which produces both graph documents the site
 * serves, and `publish-gh-pages.sh`, which performs the deploy.
 *
 * The cost was paid the same day. Bean `40fl` fixed a `kg-export` defect that
 * had kept `docs-site` red for over two hours, merged it to `main`, and **no
 * run fired** — a fix to the publisher did not rebuild what it publishes. The
 * outage and the silence after the fix were the same defect seen twice.
 *
 * ## What this checks, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * It checks the **directly invoked** scripts: a repo-relative `.ts` or `.sh`
 * path appearing in a `run:` step. That is a fact readable off the workflow.
 *
 * It does NOT follow imports. `kg-export.ts` imports a dozen modules, and
 * whether a change to one of those changes the published bytes is a question
 * about the import graph, not about this file. Claiming to check it here would
 * be a broader promise than the evidence supports — and a check that overstates
 * its own reach is the shape this repository keeps paying for. A directory
 * wildcard is the honest way to cover the transitive set, which is what
 * `docs-site.yml` now uses and what this check will accept.
 *
 * ## Third state
 *
 * A workflow with no `paths:` filter runs on every push, so it cannot be
 * under-covered and is reported as `unfiltered` rather than as a pass. A
 * workflow whose `run:` steps name no repo script is `no-scripts` — the same
 * distinction: nothing to cover is not the same fact as everything covered.
 *
 * **An empty workflow set exits 2.** A probe that found nothing must not print
 * a clean sweep — the `dh4f` shape, and the one this repository names most.
 *
 * @covers none — .github/workflows/ is not a declared graph kind

 * not on the PR, which is the half of the pair a reviewer actually looks at.
 * Reading only the first block found that workflow clean while four of its
 * scripts were uncovered in both — a parser's partial read reported as a pass.

 * An empty array means "no filter", which is TOTAL coverage (the workflow runs
