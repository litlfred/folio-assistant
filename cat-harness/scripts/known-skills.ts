 * ## Why it stopped being a literal

 * It was five hardcoded entries, four of them under `skills/`. Measured

 * (3 skills) and `authoring-who-smart-guidelines` (9) were absent from the one
 * function that answers "does this skill exist".
 *
 * Nothing had broken, and that is the point. All twelve resolved anyway
 * through a SECOND home — eleven because they also have a
 * `schemas/skills/<name>/` I/O contract, and `smart-base-tools` because it
 * also had `.claude/skills/local/smart-base-tools.json` (now under
 * `smart-base/skills/skill-definitions/`, bean `rqao`). Delete any one of
 * those second homes and `check-workflow-refs` reports a real, present skill
 * as dangling: the "wall of false dangling refs" this module's own header says
 * it exists to prevent, arriving from the module itself.
 *
 * `kg-export.ts`'s `skillMdDirs()` already scanned `skills/*` dynamically and
 * saw all six, so the two definitions disagreed BY CONSTRUCTION and agreed only
 * BY COINCIDENCE. A list somebody has to remember to extend is not a single
 * answer; it is a copy that happens to match today.
 *
 * ## Why scanning is safe here
 *
 * `skills/` is not uniformly skill packages — `framework/`, `permissions/`,
 * `remote-packages/`, `requirements/`, `roles/` and `workflows/` are other
 * node kinds. Most are excluded by carrying **no `.md`**, which is the same
 * test that admits a package, rather than by a name list that would need the
 * same remembering.
 *
 * **That test alone was not enough, and it was falsified within the day.**
 * This doc said "a directory that later grows a `.md` is a decision somebody
 * makes visibly"; `skills/memory/` then arrived with 25 of them, none a skill.
 * So the admitting test is now `.md` **that {@link isSkillMd} accepts** — the
 * visible decision is the `$schema` line inside each file rather than the
 * directory's name, because a name list is the thing this module exists to
 * stop and a directory's contents can be mixed.

 * pointed `skill-manifest-coverage.test.ts` at `knownSkills()` so the test and

 * `remote-packages/`, so it was a THIRD definition. Under it,
 * `scientific-visualization`, `hypothesis-generation` and

 * from `folio-assistant-sci/skills/content/authoring-math/package-manifest.json` two hours after bean
 * `m4zg` recorded that deleting them would be wrong. The evidence offered was a
 * `git log --diff-filter=A` search finding no file ever added for any of them —
 * which is the wrong question, because a remote skill has no file here by
 * design.
 *
 * So the answer lives beside the other one now. A checker that needs the wider

/**
 * The skills that declare `consulted: true` — reference material nobody
 * PERFORMS.
 *
 * ## The distinction, and why it had to be declared
 *
 * `kg-audit`'s `skill-in-role-or-process` reported **110 skills bound to no
 * role and no activity**, graded `major`, and the number was not one
 * population. `build-pdf`, `lean-generation` and `proof-triage` are tasks
 * somebody performs; `directory-conventions`, `opening-brief` and
 * `untrusted-input` are what the performer READS. A consulted skill belongs
 * in no lane **by its nature**, so counting it as unbound measures the
 * criterion rather than the corpus.
 *
 * It is not derivable. Two discriminators were tested over the 110 (bean
 * `y1w9`): a sibling `.ts` `SkillDefinition` covers 20 and misses
 * `glossary-build` and `editor`; an `allowed-tools:` line covers 58 and
 * splits the same families arbitrarily. Both cut across the distinction
 * rather than along it. So the axis is real, load-bearing for an audit
 * criterion, and was declared nowhere — the mirror of this repository's
 * usual defect, which is a field declared and read by nothing.
 *
 * ## Why `consulted` is the EXCEPTION rather than the default
 *
 * Absent means performed. Annotating the smaller set is the difference
 * between marking dozens of files and marking every one of them, and an
 * axis whose default costs 180 edits does not get adopted.
 *
 * ## Why this ships with its reader in the same change
 *
 * Bean `qif9` removed a front-matter field that carried 288 annotations and
 * was consumed by nothing, for three months. `kg-audit` reads this one from
 * the commit it lands in, in BOTH directions: the criterion skips a
 * consulted skill, and a separate criterion reports a consulted skill that
 * a lane or a role claims — so a wrong annotation is a finding rather than
 * a quiet exemption.

 * The skills that declare `published: false` — kept out of every published

 *
 * ## Why a declaration, when a name match already worked
 *
 * `isPublishedSkill` strips a skill whose NAME is an unpublished graph kind,
 * and its own note says why that was enough and where it stops:
 *
 * > *"Same list, because the skill and the kind share a name by
 * > construction. If that ever stops being true this needs its own list, not
 * > a cleverer derivation."*
 *
 * This is that list, and it is a declaration rather than a list in code for
 * the reason this repository applies everywhere else — `isSkillMd`, a bean's
 * front matter, a workflow instance's `$schema`: **a directory is a place to
 * look and the file says what it is.** A skill that must not be published
 * says so in its own front matter, where the author who writes it is looking.
 *
 * It EXTENDS the name rule rather than replacing it. The two answer different
 * questions — "is this named after the trashcan" and "did this skill say not
 * to publish it" — and a skill whose subject is an unpublished graph but
 * whose name is something else was previously unexpressible. Keeping both is
 * the "an unavoidable duplicate is fine while an unchecked one is not" rule:
 * the blanket test in `fsh-guts-unpublished.test.ts` asserts the OUTCOME over
 * the built document at any depth, so neither input can quietly stop working.
 *
 * Unreadable is not "publishable", and the asymmetry is deliberate — the same
 * shape as `consultedSkills` above, resolved the other way. There, treating
 * an unreadable file as consulted would EXEMPT it from a criterion, so it
 * stays performed. Here, treating one as publishable would LEAK it, so it
 * stays unpublished.
