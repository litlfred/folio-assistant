/**
 * The repository-partition ENGINE — the algorithm, with no instance's data in
 * it.
 *
 * ## What moved, and why the host had to carry prose
 *
 * `scripts/repo-partition.ts` was 1,194 lines. Measured before the split:
 * the algorithm is roughly 390 of them, this instance's exception data 272,
 * and its RATIONALE 532 — 65% of the rules block is comment, and the comments
 * are where the measurements live ("measured by putting these in the harness
 * list at the bottom first and watching the two edges survive", and a hundred
 * more like it).
 *
 * That number decided the shape of the repair. `detangler-topic-coherence`
 * was de-math'd by migrating a hardcoded table out to a folio-supplied
 * `topic-keywords.json`, and the obvious move here was the same — until the
 * 65% was counted. JSON cannot host positional per-entry rationale, so the
 * data would have arrived and the reasons would have been destroyed. The
 * mechanism still leaves and the data still stays behind; the host is a
 * MODULE rather than a document, because prose is part of the data here.
 *
 * ## What makes it generic
 *
 * Repo ids are `string`, not this instance's six-member union. Everything
 * else arrives in a {@link PartitionSpec}: the repos, the allowed-import DAG,
 * the ordered rules, the scan roots, the skipped directories and the root to
 * resolve against. Another instance writes its own spec module and reuses
 * every line of this one.
 *
 * ## The three-valued discipline is IN here, not in the caller
 *
 * `unassigned` is a distinct answer from any repo, and `unresolvedEdges` is a
 * distinct list from `crossEdges`. The header this file inherits says why:
 * "could not determine is a distinct answer from determined to be core, and
 * collapsing the two is how a wrong partition looks like a clean one."
 * A caller that wants one number has to decide which; the engine never
 * decides for it.
 *

// ── Import extraction ───────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Static and dynamic import specifiers. Deliberately regex-based rather than
 * a full parse: we need the edge set, not a type-checked AST, and a missed
 * exotic form is a false negative we can live with — it understates the
 * cross-edge count, which is the safe direction for a worklist.
 *
 * **Three alternatives, and the ORDER of the first two is load-bearing.**
 * Bean `q2wn`, measured 2026-09-21.
 *
 * The bare side-effect form — `import "./x.js";`, no binding and no `from` —
 * matched neither of the two alternatives this had before. That is not an
 * exotic form here: **every registration edge in this repository is written
 * that way**, because a module imported to run its side effect has nothing to
 * bind. So the one mechanism computing this repo's module edges was blind to
 * exactly the class that carries load-time registration — the class whose
 * absence produces `unknown graph kind`.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-21, both numbers because they count different things: the
 * relative specifiers this extracts went **2140 → 2214** (76 gained, 2
 * dropped), and the partition's resolved internal edges went **1886 → 1961**.
 * The gained ones are `schemas/folio-graph-kind` almost without exception.
 *
 * **And the blindness was hiding a live rule violation**, which this bean had
 * left explicitly unestablished: wrong-direction edges went **0 → 25**. The
 * rule is `adapter-layering.test.ts`'s — *core may import the harness; the
 * harness may not import core* — and all 25 are harness modules
 * side-effect-importing core's `folio-graph-kind` to get the `folio` kind
 * registered before they read a declaration. So the check was reporting a
 * clean partition over 25 edges it could not see.
 *
 * **Appending a third alternative does not fix it**, which is why the bare
 * form is tried FIRST. Alternation is left-to-right at each position: at a
 * bare import the `from`-scanning alternative would run first, scan forward
 * past it into a LATER statement, find that one's `from`, and consume both —
 * so the bare edge stayed missing however the alternative was written.
 * Measured on the 12-shape corpus in `engine.test.ts`: appending fixes 2 of
 * the 5 failures and leaves 3, including `import "./a.js"` followed by a
 * normal import, where two edges collapse into one.
 *
 * **`[^;]` rather than `[\s\S]` in that scan** stops the same overreach in
 * the other direction. A static import statement contains no `;` before its
 * `from`, so this only narrows — and it removed 2 false edges where the scan
 * crossed into a TEMPLATE LITERAL: `init-folio.ts` writes
 * `import … from "../../schema/builders"` into a *generated* folio, and the
 * scan was attributing that scaffolded import to the platform script. Neither
 * resolved to a file, so nothing downstream changed; they were noise in the
 * edge set rather than a wrong verdict.

/**
 * Is this module a **composition root** — a command, rather than a library?
 *
 * The layering rule (`core may import the harness; the harness may not import
 * core`) is a rule about LIBRARIES. A command is where an application is
 * assembled, so it necessarily knows every layer it wires together; that is
 * what makes it the command and not a library. Reading the edge out of a
 * composition root as a layering violation asks a binary not to know its own
 * dependencies.
 *
 * **Derived, never listed.** A hand-maintained set of "entry points" is the
 * kind that rots — the `tyyc` shape, where the symptom of forgetting is
 * invisible. Measured 2026-09-21 over the 25 modules bean `q2wn` exposed, the
 * two criteria separate them EXACTLY and with nothing left over:
 *
 * | | shebang or `import.meta.main` | |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | the 18 commands | **all 18** | `kg-export.ts`, `print-stub.ts`, every `check-*` |
 * | the 7 libraries | **none** | `repo-root.ts`, `known-skills.ts`, `harness-config.ts` |
 *
 * So the split costs no judgement here, and a new command declares itself by
 * being runnable rather than by being remembered.
 *
 * **What this does NOT license.** A library reaching across a layer is still a
 * violation and still fails — which is the half that was actually load-bearing,
 * because a library's edge is inherited by every module that imports it, and
 * `repo-root.ts` alone has 92 importers.
 *
 * **The other half was named and never built.** This paragraph said
 * `check:composition-roots` *"refuses a command that READS a declaration
 * without carrying the registration"*, and seven source files repeated it.
 * There is no such script: `bun run check:composition-roots` exits "Script
 * not found". So the guarantee that a library could safely omit the
 * registration rested on a gate nobody wrote, and nothing failed to say so.
 *
 * It is MOOT rather than fixed (bean `z9ax`). #840 put the registration
 * trigger at the foot of `cat-harness.ts`, and a reader lives in that module,
 * so loading it is a precondition of calling one — there is no longer a
 * command that can forget it, and the 74 redundant copies were removed.
