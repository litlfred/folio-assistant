/**
 * ingest-ig-menu.ts — read a FHIR IG's navigation out of its `sushi-config.yaml`.
 *
 * Sibling of `ingest-ig-artifacts.ts`, and deliberately a SEPARATE ingest: that
 * one reads the IG's OUTPUT (a gh-pages tree), this one reads its SOURCE (the
 * config, in a git repository, at a commit). Two sources, two provenance
 * blocks. Folding the menu into `index.json` would give one file two answers
 * to "where did this come from".
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat-harness/scripts/ingest-ig-menu.ts \
 *   --source /path/to/smart-trust --out smart-trust/fhir-artifact-index
 * bun run cat-harness/scripts/ingest-ig-menu.ts --out … --check
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why an ingest rather than a hand-written file
 *
 * The owner supplied the menu as a screenshot first. Typing it out was refused
 * for reasons recorded on `schemas/ig-menu.ts`: a picture carries no hrefs, and
 * a closed dropdown is indistinguishable from an empty one. The config carries
 * both, so this reads the config.
 *
 * ## Three states, and `--check` without `--source` is the third
 *
 * `--check` with no `--source` cannot compare anything: the upstream checkout
 * may not exist on this machine, which is the normal case in CI. It reports
 * that it could not determine and exits **2**, never 0 — the same line
 * `ingest-ig-artifacts.ts` draws, and for the same reason: a check that
 * silently passes over a comparison it never made is this repository's most
 * expensive recurring defect.
