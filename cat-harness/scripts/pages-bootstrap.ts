/**
 * Where will this folio be published, and is it there yet?
 *
 * The last thing `folio-assistant-core/processes/conduct/getting-started.bpmn` does is hand the author
 * a link, because a folio that has just been scaffolded is worth very little to
 * its author until they can see it. This derives the address, reports whether
 * anything is set up to publish to it, and — with `--wait` — probes until the
 * site answers.
 *
 * ## Four states — the branch first, then the address
 *
 * `unprovisioned` is checked **before anything else**: `git ls-remote --heads
 * <remote> gh-pages` found no `gh-pages` branch, and the publish route deploys
 * from that branch. GitHub Pages cannot be switched on to serve a branch that
 * does not exist, so every later step is moot until it does. Owner, 2026-10-01:
 * *"need to create gh-pages branch before can turn on"*; repeated 2026-10-07:
 * *"need to create gh-pages before can deploy"* (issue #2417). The report
 * prints the exact command, and `--provision` runs it. This is `A_Provision` in
 * bootstrap-tools' `render-kg-to-github-pages.bpmn`, and `A_ProvisionGhPages`
 * in `getting-started.bpmn`.
 *
 * The remaining three are about the address:
 *
 * `live` is a success response. `not-yet` is a **measured** 404: the server
 * answered and said there is nothing there, which is the ordinary state for the
 * first minutes after a scaffold. `unknown` is the absence of a measurement —
 * no URL could be derived, nothing was probed, or the request failed.
 *
 * Collapsing `unknown` into `not-yet` would mean telling an author their site
 * is "still building" when in fact nothing was ever checked. That is the defect
 * this repository has already paid for twice in other guises — the README
 * contents table rendering an unreadable publish ref as an empty table, and the
 * simulators section rendering an absent directory as "no simulators". Both
 * replaced a correct answer with a confident wrong one.
 *
 * `decisions/pages-live-gate.dmn` holds the same three states as a decision
 * table, and `--json` emits exactly the facts that table reads.
 *
 * ## It does not deploy — and it creates a remote branch only when told to
 *
 * Publishing is a GitHub Actions workflow's job. This reports whether such a
 * workflow exists and what it is called; it never dispatches a workflow or
 * configures Pages. An author who has no publish workflow is told so, which is
 * more useful than a script that silently invents one.
 *
 * The ONE write it can make is `--provision`: an orphan `gh-pages` holding a
 * placeholder `index.html` and `.nojekyll`, built with git plumbing (the
 * working tree and index are never touched) and pushed without force. It is
 * idempotent — a branch that already exists is reported and left alone. Without
 * the flag nothing is pushed, whatever the state.
 *
 * It also says which Pages **source** it expects. A publish workflow that
 * pushes `gh-pages` needs "Deploy from a branch: gh-pages, / (root)"; picking
 * "GitHub Actions" there is the litlfred/test#3 mistake, where the workflow
 * pushed a branch that Pages was never told to serve.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/pages-bootstrap.ts               # derive + report, no probe
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/pages-bootstrap.ts --wait        # probe until live, bounded
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/pages-bootstrap.ts --wait --timeout 300
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/pages-bootstrap.ts --json        # facts for the DMN gate
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/pages-bootstrap.ts --provision   # create gh-pages if absent, then report
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/pages-bootstrap.ts --remote upstream   # a remote other than origin
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 live, 0 not-yet (it is not an error to be early), 2 unknown,
 * 3 unprovisioned (no gh-pages branch — run with --provision), 4 --provision
 * was asked for and failed.
 *
