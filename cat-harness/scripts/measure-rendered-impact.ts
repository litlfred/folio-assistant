/**
 * Measure a staging build against its published before side, and check the
 * prediction (bean `bnjs`, issue #971).
 *
 * The renderers PREDICT which rendered files a change alters, from their
 * dependency cones (`rendered-impact.json`). This compares the site the
 * staging job just built with the one already published for the base, and
 * writes `rendered-measured/v1`: the build diff and, from
 * `comparePrediction`, the files the prediction MISSED. A missed page is one
 * a reviewer was never shown, so the coverage gate counts it.
 *
 * ## Only when the before side IS the base
 *
 * The before side is main's site at the publish root, built from whatever
 * commit last published it (`_main-site.json` records it). If main moved
 * since, the diff also holds main's own changes, which would read as missed
 * pages. So `status` is `known` only when that commit is the PR's base, and
 * `not-base` otherwise; the coverage gate counts missed pages only when it is
 * `known`. With no manifest there is no before side to measure against, and
 * nothing is written: no file is "not measured", never "nothing missed".
 *
 * ## What is compared
 *
 * Exactly the files main's publish wrote (the manifest's list) on the before
 * side, and, on the after side, every built file except the staging job's
 * own artefacts. The publish root also holds `STAGING/` and the render log,
 * which are other sites. Run it BEFORE the staging banner is injected: the
 * banner names the commit, so every page would differ.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/measure-rendered-impact.ts --before pages --after _site
 *     --predicted _site/rendered-impact.json --base <sha> --out _site/rendered-measured.json
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/measure-rendered-impact
