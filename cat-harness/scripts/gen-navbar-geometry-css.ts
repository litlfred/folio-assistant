/**
 * Generate `navbar-geometry.css` from `lib/navbar-geometry.ts`.
 *
 * @module scripts/gen-navbar-geometry-css
 * @covers none — generated from `lib/navbar-geometry.ts`; its source is code, which
 *   `check:partition` and the TypeScript gates already grade
 *
 * Same contract as `gen-avatars-css.ts`: the module is the source and the
 * stylesheet is a rendering of it, so a width has one home. `--check` fails
 * when the committed file is stale.
 *
 * ## What this closes
 *
 * `sjic`. `navbar.ts` interpolates its numbers into the stylesheet it emits
 * for a mounted page; `docs-ui.css` is hand-authored and stated its own. They
 * disagreed — 40px against 56px at rest, 232px against 248px open — and each
 * side had a test asserting its own copy, so both were green while the two
 * navbars the owner called "the same navbar" were different widths.
 *
 * **A generated custom property is what makes that unrepeatable.** The check
 * gate is the load-bearing half: without it the file is a snapshot that goes
 * stale silently, which is the same defect with an extra step.
 *
 * ## Why custom properties rather than rewriting `docs-ui.css`
 *
 * `docs-ui.css` already reads `var(--fa-nav-collapsed)` and
 * `var(--fa-nav-open)` in nine places. Generating the two DEFINITIONS and
 * leaving every use in the authored stylesheet keeps the hand-written CSS
 * hand-written — the alternative is a generated 5,000-line file nobody may
 * edit, to own two numbers.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 written or up to date · 1 stale under `--check`.
