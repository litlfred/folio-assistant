/**
 * Can this repository actually be checked out?
 *
 * Every other gate here asks whether the CONTENT is right. This one asks
 * whether the tree can be created at all on the filesystems people clone it
 * onto — a property of the filenames, which nothing checked until 2026-09-21,
 * when a user's clone produced:
 *
 * ```
 * Receiving objects: 100% (647920/647920), 869.73 MiB | 9.21 MiB/s, done.
 * error: invalid path 'cat-harness/test/results/kg-qa/skills/requirements/req:agent-workflow.kg-qa.json'
 * fatal: unable to checkout working tree
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why the generator fix is not this check
 *
 * `kgQaSidecarPath` now encodes the stem it composes, so those seven sidecars
 * cannot come back. That fixes one writer. It does not fix a hand-authored
 * file, a second composer nobody has found yet, or a path arriving with a
 * vendored dependency — and the seven got in precisely because no gate stood
 * between a legal-on-Linux name and the commit.
 *
 * So the subject is **every tracked path**, read from `git ls-files`, not the
 * working tree: an untracked scratch file breaks nobody's clone, and grading it
 * would make the gate fail for reasons the committer cannot fix.
 *
 * ## Why a failure here is worse than it looks
 *
 * Git aborts the whole checkout on the FIRST invalid path. One bad filename
 * does not cost one file — it costs the working tree, for every developer on
 * that platform, with the fetch having already succeeded. The author sees
 * nothing wrong and CI runs on Linux, so the only signal is somebody else's
 * failed clone.
 *
 * ## Third state
 *
 * Exit 2 is "could not check" — no `git`, or not a repository — and is never
 * rendered as a pass, the same rule as `check-harness-dirs.ts` and
 * `check-ci-health.ts`. A gate that cannot see the file list has not cleared
 * it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run check:portable-paths
 *   bun run check:portable-paths -- --json
 *
 * Exit: 0 every tracked path is creatable, 1 at least one is not, 2 could not check.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-portable-paths
