/**
 * render-pipeline.ts — the repository's renders, in the order their
 * dependencies imply, with the failure policy declared per step.
 *
 * ## The order is the owner's, and it is two stages rather than one
 *
 * Asked where the README render belongs, 2026-09-20:
 *
 * > bootsterap rended in main as exception. json/jsonld rendered last as
 * > intermeridaay renderes may add to dynamic KG. means maybe two stage
 * > rendering.... current state of KG renderered as json/jsonld failuer =
 * > fatal, readme updated faliure = fatal , dynamic parts (kg vierwe,
 * > visaluzers, etc) render in flattened depndency order, failures =
 * > skip/log/qa or so. dynamic content then hets get json/jsonld export
 * > avaiable under cat-harness/state.jsonld or so
 *
 * Two exports, not one, and that is what resolves the apparent contradiction
 * in "json/jsonld first" and "json/jsonld last": they are different documents.
 *
 * | stage | what it renders | on failure |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 1 | the CURRENT declared state, as json/jsonld — then the README from it | **fatal** |
 * | 2 | the dynamic parts: viewers, visualisers, doc pages, diagrams | skip + log |
 * | 3 | the dynamic state, exported once the stage-2 renderers have contributed | fatal |
 *
 * **Stage 1 is fatal because everything downstream is derived from it.** A KG
 * that does not render is not a degraded build, it is an unknown one, and a
 * README generated from a half-read graph states a wrong fact in the file a
 * reader opens first. **Stage 2 is not fatal** because a missing visualiser
 * costs one rendering and nothing else — the `skip/log/qa` the owner asked
 * for. That policy lives on each {@link OrderedStep}, not in this runner: see
 * `dependency-order.ts` for why.
 *
 * ## Bootstrap is the exception, and it is declared as one
 *
 * *"bootsterap rended in main as exception"* — bootstrap renders before
 * the graph is read at all, because it is what an agent reads when no harness
 * is installed and therefore cannot depend on one having rendered. It is the
 * same exemption `check:subgraph-coverage` already grants it from the
 * `visualiser` criterion, and it is a SECOND criterion rather than a hole:
 * bootstrap owes its own .json/.jsonld instead.
 *
 * ## What this file is NOT
 *
 * It is not a second CI workflow. `docs-site.yml` remains what publishes; this
 * declares the ORDER and the policy in one readable place, runs it locally,
 * and gives CI one thing to call per stage. A pipeline order that exists only
 * as the sequence of steps in a YAML file is an order nobody can test — and
 * this repository has a bean (`xom7`) about exactly what a workflow's
 * behaviour costs when the repository holds no statement of it.
