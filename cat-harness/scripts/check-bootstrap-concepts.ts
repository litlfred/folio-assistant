/**
 * A BOOTSTRAP SCHEMA NAMES NO OUTSIDE CONCEPT.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-23 (issue #1164): *"make sure no DAK/L2 smart who etc
 * refences in bootrap schemas. no external concepts."*
 *
 * Bootstrap is the layer every harness starts from. A term from one
 * derivative's world — a health-guideline model, a standards body, an
 * interchange format — written into a bootstrap schema makes every other
 * harness inherit a vocabulary it has no use for, and makes the base depend,
 * in its words, on something above it. That is the direction rule this
 * repository enforces for code (`check:partition`), applied to the schemas'
 * PROSE as well as their fields, since a description is part of the contract
 * a generated JSON Schema publishes.
 *
 * ## Beside bean `iwtn`'s test, not instead of it
 *
 * `cat-harness/schemas/graph.test.ts` holds ALL of `bootstrap/` to a stricter
 * list — no layer above it may be named either (`cat-harness`, `folio`),
 * because bootstrap is self-definitional. This check covers the narrower
 * rule, no OUTSIDE concept, and applies it to one thing that test does not
 * read: the Zod SOURCES bootstrap's schemas are generated from. Those moved
 * into `cat-harness/schemas/` when the `bootstrap-tools` instance was retired
 * (bean `319n`), where they may name cat-harness, but still may not name an
 * outside concept, since their text becomes the published schema.
 *
 * ## Which files
 *
 * Both halves are DERIVED, not listed:
 *
 * - every directory the `bootstrap` instance declares with the `schemas`
 *   graph kind, where the published `*.schema.json` live; and
 * - every `../schemas/*.ts` module `gen-bootstrap-schemas.ts` imports, which
 *   are the sources those documents are generated from.
 *
 * A declaration that cannot be read is a failure, not a skip. A check that
 * silently scanned nothing would report clean over exactly the files it
 * exists to guard.
 *
 * ## What counts
 *
 * A short, explicit list of words, each with why it is here. Case matters
 * where the plain-English word is innocent: `who` is a pronoun, `WHO` is an
 * organisation; `smart` alone is an adjective, `SMART` and `smart-…` name a
 * family of harnesses.
