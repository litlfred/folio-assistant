/**
 * SUBSCRIBE an instance to an external Knowledge Graph — a **substrate** — at a

 * directory down — `upstreamPath`), judge it, and on
 * success record the subscription and a cached snapshot of what was judged.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/kg-subscribe
 * @covers cat-harness, substrate-snapshot
 *
 * Issue #1719, epic bean `fnx4`, slice 4 of
 * `docs/proposals/kg-subscriptions.md`. The other two verbs, materialise and
 * instantiate, are slices 5–7; this one writes the choice and the pin, and
 * nothing else arrives.
 *
 * ## What a substrate is — the rule, stated once
 *
 * A repository is a substrate at a commit when **both** hold:
 *
 * 1. **It carries a bootstrap declaration — at the root, or in ONE directory
 *    named for it.** The declaration is found by bootstrap's own rule
 *    (`declarationFileIn`: the `<stem>.json` whose `name` equals `<stem>`, and
 *    exactly one of them) — where to look is the section after next — and it parses as
 *    bootstrap's `KnowledgeGraphDeclarationSchema`. Nothing of this harness's
 *    schema is asked of it: a substrate need not be built on cat-harness, and
 *    every field bootstrap does not define is an Extension it may carry.
 * 2. **It declares at least one harness.** Bootstrap defines the term: *"A
 *    Knowledge Graph whose Subgraphs hold Skills, Roles or Processes."* And
 *    bootstrap names the Graph Typology for each: `skills` holds Skills,
 *    `scenarios` holds Roles, `processes` holds Processes
 *    (`BOOTSTRAP_GRAPH_TYPOLOGIES`). So a declaration IS a harness when at least
 *    one of its `directories` lists one of those three kinds in `graphTypologies`
 *    — {@link HARNESS_GRAPH_TYPOLOGIES}, {@link harnessesOf}.
 *
 * ### Why that rule, and not the two nearer ones
 *
 * - **Not "has a `<name>.config.json`".** That is what `harness-tiles.ts`
 *   reads, and it answers a different question: whether a harness is
 *   INSTANTIATED here, in the navbar. A substrate offers harnesses to be
 *   instantiated by the subscriber (slice 7), so requiring the upstream to
 *   have instantiated its own would refuse exactly the repositories a
 *   subscription exists for.
 * - **Not this harness's own graph typologies.** A kind cat-harness registers
 *   (`methodology`, `cat-harness`, …) is an Extension to a reader that knows
 *   only bootstrap, and the owner's definition says the substrate meets
 *   BOOTSTRAP's requirements. Judging it by our vocabulary would make "is a
 *   substrate" depend on which harness is asking.
 *
 * ### Where the declaration is looked for — `upstreamPath` (bean `437w`)
 *
 * A fork that left a monorepo often keeps its instance one directory down:
 * a fork may carry `shared/<name>.json` and nothing at
 * its root, and the directory is NOT named for the instance. So the search is,
 * in order ({@link judgeTree}):
 *
 * 1. **`--upstream-path <dir>`, or the one the subscription already records.**
 *    Only that directory is read, and it must hold exactly one declaration
 *    (the one named `--name`, when given). This is the spelling to use
 *    whenever the fallback below would have to choose.
 * 2. **The root**, by bootstrap's rule — unchanged, so every subscription
 *    recorded before this existed judges the same bytes.
 * 3. **Exactly one level down**: every top-level directory's `<stem>.json`
 *    whose `name` is `<stem>` — the rule `findInstance` in
 *    `scripts/remote-mount.ts` (PR #2326) applies to a remote tree, and
 *    `findDeclarationFile` applies on disk. With `--name`, or the name a
 *    recorded snapshot carries, only a file of that name counts. ONE
 *    candidate is accepted and its directory recorded as the subscription's
 *    `upstreamPath`; TWO OR MORE are refused by name, never guessed between
 *    (`ambiguous`) — pick one with `--upstream-path` or `--name`.
 *
 * The field is named and shaped as `upstreamPath` on #2326's remote subgraph
 * source — a repository-relative directory — so one word means one thing.
 * Deeper than one level is reached only by naming it: a walk of the whole
 * tree would cost a blob per `.json` file in the repository, and would find
 * fixtures and vendored instances as readily as the one meant.
 *
 * A harness that is NOT the declaration found — a second instance nested
 * elsewhere in the same repository — is still not seen; that is a limit of
 * reading one declaration, and the zero-harness reason says so.
 *
 * ### A content Knowledge Graph is a SECOND kind — owner, 2026-10-06
 *
 * A declaration with Subgraphs and NO harness — a FHIR implementation guide,
 * a document corpus — is accepted, as kind **`content`**,
 * not as a substrate. Bootstrap's definition above is unchanged; this is a
 * separate classification, written explicitly wherever it is recorded: the
 * subscription carries `kind: "content"`, the snapshot carries `kind:
 * "content"` and an empty `harnesses`, and the verdict's `state` is
 * `"content"` (`AcceptedVerdict`), so no reader can take one for the other.
 * A content subscription contributes NO skills, processes or roles: it may
 * choose no harness (the schema refuses one), `kg:instantiate` refuses it,
 * and its Subgraphs are referenced or materialised like any other. A
 * declaration with no harness and no Subgraph is still not-a-substrate, and
 * a tree with no declaration keeps every reason it had.
 *
 * ## Three answers, never two
 *
 * - **substrate** — both points hold; the harness names are listed.
 * - **content** — the declaration holds and declares Subgraphs but no harness.
 *   Accepted, as the other kind; see above.
 * - **not-a-substrate(reason)** — the bytes were read and one point fails.
 * - **ambiguous(reason, candidates)** — the bytes were read and more than one
 *   directory one level down holds a declaration. `subscribe` reports it as
 *   REFUSED, with every candidate: the fix is a choice somebody makes, not a
 *   verdict on the repository.
 * - **could-not-determine(reason)** — the bytes were NOT read: the network,
 *   the forge, a SHA the remote does not serve. Collapsing this into "not a
 *   substrate" would record a guess about a repository nobody looked at, and
 *   collapsing it into "substrate" would subscribe to one. Both are `dh4f`.
 *
 * An unpinned ref is refused BEFORE anything is fetched, with
 * `sync-remote-skills`' {@link pinnedRef}: the same reason, the same words.
 *
 * ## What is written, and where
 *
 * - The subscriber's `<instance>.json` gains (or keeps) a `subscriptions`
 *   entry: `id`, `repository`, `ref`, and NOTHING CHOSEN — every subgraph,
 *   asset and harness starts referenced. A re-subscribe at the same pin keeps
 *   whatever the subscriber has chosen since and changes no byte.
 * - A {@link SubstrateSnapshotSchema} node, `<id>.substrate.json`, in the
 *   subscriber's OWN directory declared with graph typology `substrate-snapshot`.
 *   Found through the declaration, never by a path literal; an instance that
 *   declares none is refused with what to declare. Why a wrapper rather than a
 *   copy of `<name>.json` is on the schema.
 *
 * Moving the pin of a subscription that has CHOSEN parts is refused: that is
 * `refresh-materialized` (the proposal: "Refresh is not re-subscribe"), because
 * the chosen parts' materialisation records are pinned to the old commit.
 *
 * ## `--check` — the gate over what was written
 *
 * Offline, over every instance in the checkout: each subscription has its
 * snapshot at its pin, each snapshot's digest is over its bytes and its
 * summary is what re-judging those bytes gives, every chosen part is one the
 * substrate offers, and no snapshot is orphaned ({@link checkSubscriptions}).
 * It is what JUDGES the `substrate-snapshot` kind rather than merely typing it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run kg:subscribe <owner/repo>@<40-char-sha> [--upstream-path <dir>] [--name <instance>]
 *                        [--instance <dir>] [--id <id>] [--dry-run]
 *   bun run kg:subscribe:check
