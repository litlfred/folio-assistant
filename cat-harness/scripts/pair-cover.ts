/**
 * Checks whose answer `regen` already has from other pairs — bean `8qyc`.
 *
 * @module scripts/pair-cover
 * @graphNode none — a declaration table read by `regen-after-merge.ts`
 *
 * ## The duplication this removes
 *
 * Measured on `main` 2026-10-05 (`regen --dry-run --no-cache --jobs 1`, 117
 * pairs, 637 s): two of the three slowest pairs re-ran work the run was doing
 * anyway.
 *
 * - **`skill:register:check` (107 s, a barrier)** is a declaration audit (1.5 s)
 *   plus `bun run` of nine checks, {@link CHECKS} in `skill-register.ts`. Every
 *   one of the nine is ALSO a gate, so regen asks each of them as a pair of its
 *   own, spelt identically.
 * - **`kg:audit:check` (81 s)** is `kg-audit.ts --check --against main` for the
 *   `cat-harness` instance. `kg:audit:all:check` (198 s) spawns exactly that
 *   for every declared instance, `cat-harness` included, and
 *   `--instance ./cat-harness` resolves to the auditor's own root, so the run
 *   is the same program on the same root with the same flags. The coverer's
 *   exit is non-zero whenever any spawned audit's is (`kg-audit-all.ts`).
 *
 * ## The rule, and why it cannot produce a false green
 *
 * A covered check's verdict is DERIVED, never assumed:
 *
 *     verdict(covered) = verdict(residual) AND verdict(each coverer)
 *
 * where the residual is what the covered check judges that no coverer does
 * (`skill:register:check`'s declarations), or nothing. Both sides are read in
 * the SAME pass, from the same tree, so the conjunction is what the covered
 * check would have answered had it been run then. Every artefact the covered
 * check verifies is still verified, by the pair that owns it.
 *
 * A covered check is folded only when EVERY coverer is among the pairs being
 * asked in that pass. A run that asks a subset — `--fast`, or a `--changed` run
 * that selected the covered pair and not its coverer — asks it in full. And a
 * coverer that did not come back clean passes its outcome on: a covered check
 * is never `current` beside a red coverer.
 *
 * ## What it does not change
 *
 * CI. `gates` runs `skill:register:check` and `kg:audit:check` whole, as
 * before; this table is read only by `regen`. Whether either gate is redundant
 * in CI is a separate question, put on the PR rather than decided here.
