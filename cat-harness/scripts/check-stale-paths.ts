/**
 * A bean's stated PATH must not route through work that is already finished.
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run check:stale-paths
 * bun run check:stale-paths --json
 * ```
 *
 * Bean `k59d`. `check:bean-bodies` already reports a prose ``blocked on `id` ``
 * whose target is closed, and it is right about what it does — but it reads a
 * SENTENCE. A milestone does not write sentences about its blockers. It writes
 * a **route**:
 *
 * ```
 * `b5f0` → `603s` → `hfkl` → `2krx` → (`6lb8` ‖ `ivfw` + `5y4b`) → `pb04` → `supn`
 * ```
 *
 * Measured on `main` the day this shipped: `p5wm` routes through **four**
 * `completed` beans and `yg29`'s numbered "Shortest path" names four more. Both
 * are GOAL milestones — the first thing any *what is next* reader opens — and
 * both were wrong. Two delegated agents sent to read them this morning each had
 * to correct the milestone before they could start.
 *
 * `bean-blocking` says a block whose blocker is gone reads to the next agent as
 * abandoned work. On a leaf bean that costs one agent one read. On a milestone
 * it costs every agent that asks what the goal needs next.
 *
 * ## Two rules, both narrow on purpose
 *
 * | rule | shape |
 * |---|---|
 * | **chain** | an id **adjacent to an arrow** (`→` or `->`), in an open bean, whose status is closed |
 * | **numbered step** | a numbered list item under a heading naming a path/order/sequence |
 * | **done-when** | an **unchecked** `- [ ]` clause naming a closed bean as a **precondition** |
 *
 * ## The two false-positive classes, measured and closed
 *
 * Both were found by running the first draft over the whole store — three
 * findings, of which **two were wrong**, which is the ratio that makes a rule
 * worth narrowing rather than shipping.
 *
 * **An arrow is not always a dependency.** `x3bd` contains *"README is 97 → 66
 * lines"* in a paragraph that also mentions `lv3j` some hundreds of characters
 * away. The first draft asked only "does this line have an arrow and a closed
 * id", and reported it. So the closed id must be **an operand of the arrow** —
 * immediately beside one — not merely present on the same line. See
 * {@link chainRefs}.
 *
 * **A bean describing another bean's stale path is not stale.** `k59d` — this
 * check's own bean — quotes `p5wm`'s chain verbatim as its evidence, and the
 * first draft reported it as `k59d`'s own defect. That is exactly the shape
 * `check-bean-bodies` closed with a quotation guard, and exactly the shape that
 * flagged `jijc` a few hours earlier. Here the tell is **attribution**: a known
 * bean id appearing before the chain, outside it, names whose path it is. See
 * {@link attributedTo}.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT claim
 *
 * It does **not** distinguish *"this waits on `x`"* from *"this unblocks `x`"*.
 * A chain position is directional by construction, so the distinction does not
 * arise for the chain rule; for anything looser it would, and that is why
 * nothing looser is implemented. `k59d`'s own second Done-when asks for exactly
 * this: draw the line where it can be drawn, and report the rest as
 * **could not determine** rather than guess. Prose that merely mentions a
 * closed bean is neither reported nor counted as clean — it is not examined,
 * and this paragraph is how a reader knows.
