/**
 * Every OPEN bean is placed under an epic or a milestone. This is what keeps the roadmap a plan.
 *
 * `beans roadmap` groups by `parent:` and drops everything else into a
 * "Miscellaneous" section. Measured 2026-09-19 before the restructure: one
 * epic, and **72 of 86 open beans** with no parent — a list in creation order
 * rather than a plan, which is exactly what `AGENTS.md` says the roadmap
 * exists not to be.
 *
 * The restructure fixed the instance. **This is the guard, not the fix**, and
 * it exists because nothing else notices: `beans create` does not ask for a
 * parent, a new bean is textually clean, and the roadmap grows a
 * Miscellaneous section again in silence. That is the `xom7` shape — a
 * defect indistinguishable from health from inside the repo — applied to the
 * work plan itself.
 *
 * It locks in a property the corpus HAS rather than demanding work to reach
 * one: the orphan count was zero when this was written, so adopting it costs
 * nothing today and prices the next unparented bean at the moment it lands.
 *
 * ## What it checks
 *
 * 1. Every bean whose `status` is `todo` or `in-progress` carries a `parent`.
 * 2. Every `parent` names a bean that EXISTS. A dangling parent is worse than
 *    none: the roadmap silently omits the child rather than listing it.
 * 3. Every `parent` names a bean whose `type` is `epic` or `milestone`.
 *    Parenting a task to a task nests the roadmap somewhere nobody looks.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT check
 *
 * **Closed beans.** A `completed` or `scrapped` bean predating the epic
 * structure is history, and back-filling 184 of them would be busywork that
 * changes no plan. Only open work has to be placeable.
 *
 * **A ROOT's own parent.** Milestones and epics are the roadmap's roots, so
 * neither is required to carry one — `ROOT_TYPES` below. A milestone sits
 * above an epic in this store's stated hierarchy and has nothing to hang
 * from; an epic's parent is a milestone when it has one, and it need not.
 *
 * ## Third state
 *
 * A repository with no bean store is **not** a failure — it has no work
 * plan to check, and is reported as `no bean store`. Exit 2 is "could not
 * check" and is never rendered as a pass, the same rule
 * `check-harness-dirs.ts` and `check-ci-health.ts` follow.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run check:bean-parents
 *   bun run check:bean-parents -- --json
 *
 * Exit: 0 every open bean is placed (or no store), 1 a real orphan, 2 could not check.
 *

/**
 * The types that are ROOTS of the roadmap, so "open with no parent" is not a
 * defect for them.
 *
 * `beans prime` states this store's hierarchy as `milestone -> epic ->
 * feature -> task/bug`, so a milestone sits ABOVE an epic and has nothing to
 * hang from. Until 2026-09-20 only `epic` was here, because no milestone had
 * ever been created — the type was configured and unused. The first three
 * (the owner's goals, bean `wqht`) failed this check on the day they landed,
 * demanding a parent that by the hierarchy cannot exist.
 *
 * That is the same shape this file's own header warns about one level down:
 * a rule that forces a bean to declare something it never claimed, in order
 * to stay green.
 *
 * TWO SESSIONS FIXED THIS INDEPENDENTLY on 2026-09-20, from opposite ends —
 * one from `beans prime`'s stated hierarchy, one from `wqht`'s own claim that
 * the check "already allows epics under milestones", which it did not. The
 * corroboration is worth keeping: the same defect found twice by different
 * routes is evidence the hierarchy was genuinely unrepresentable here, not
 * that one session misread the check.

 * roadmap somewhere nobody looks, which is the original reason this
 * constraint exists.
 *
 * `feature` WAS MISSING and the owner settled it, 2026-09-22 (`itka` finding
 * 2, issue #941): a feature is a real tier that may hold tasks, not a label.
 * Until then this set omitted it while the file's own header quoted the
 * four-tier sentence to justify `ROOT_TYPES` — the check cited the rule and
 * then contradicted it.
 *
 * MEASURED BEFORE THE RULING, so the choice was not made blind: 51 beans are
 * typed `feature`, exactly 2 hang from one and neither is open, and 25 of 25
 * open features hang from an epic. The omission had no live victim; what it

 * bean's parent. While the set held only the two root types those questions
 * coincided. A middle tier separates them.
 *
 * ## Why this is a DELTA over #953 rather than a duplicate of it
 *
 * #953 closed the same hole with `b.type === "epic" && p.type !== "milestone"`
 * — stated positively, which is right, and which is why that rule is kept
 * below unchanged. But it guards **epics only**. Widening `PARENT_TYPES`
 * admits two inversions and #953's form catches one of them:
 *
 * | shape | caught by the epic rule | caught by RANK |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | an `epic` under a `feature`   | yes | yes |
 * | a `feature` under a `feature` | **no** | yes |
 *
 * MEASURED, not argued: against merged `main` at `b7f8945b`, a five-bean
 * fixture (`m1` <- `e1` <- `f1` <- `f2`) reported `problems: []`. A feature
 * nested in a feature passes today.
 *
 * A type absent here is not ranked and is not direction-checked — the rule
 * declines to judge what the hierarchy does not mention, rather than guessing
 * a position for it.
