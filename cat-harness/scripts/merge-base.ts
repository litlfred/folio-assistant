/**
 * Merge the base branch in, resolving ONLY the conflicts a declared pattern
 * covers, and prove the result with the gate set (bean `y7b3`, issue #1707).
 *
 * @module scripts/merge-base
 * @graphNode none — a maintenance command over the working tree
 * @covers none — a merge step: it changes the tree and judges no declared graph
 *
 * The executable form of `processes/sdlc/merge-base.bpmn`, which `Task_PrepareMerge`
 * in `code-change-review.bpmn` calls. The patterns, their strategies and why
 * each is safe are in `merge-conflict-patterns.ts` and the skill of that name.
 *
 * ## All or nothing
 *
 * Every conflicted path is classified BEFORE anything is changed. If one is
 * refused — authored, or named by no pattern — the merge is ABORTED and the
 * tree is left exactly as it was, with the refused paths listed. A half-resolved
 * merge reads as progress and is not.
 *
 * ## Proved, not assumed
 *
 * After resolving, `bun run regen` asks every check the CI workflow runs and
 * runs each stale one's writer until the tree settles. A non-zero exit
 * (`unrepaired`, or a check with no writer) aborts the merge too: a resolution
 * the gates cannot reproduce is not a resolution. It runs as `regen --changed
 * <fork point>`, asking only the pairs either side touched; see
 * {@link regenArgs} for why that is sound, and `--full-regen` for the old way.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run merge:main                 # merge origin/main, resolve, regenerate, commit
 *   bun run merge:main -- --full-regen # ...asking every pair, not only those the merge touched
 *   bun run merge:main -- --dry-run    # classify the conflicts, change nothing
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/merge-base.ts --base origin/<branch>
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/merge-base.ts --root <worktree> --base <sha> --dry-run
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/merge-base.ts --root <worktree> --base <sha> --no-regen  # a train member
 *
 * Exit 0 merged (or already up to date) · 1 refused or unproven, tree restored ·
 * 2 could not start (dirty tree, no such base).

 * The arguments `merge:main` gives `regen` — bean `94zs`.

 * `--changed <fork point>`, where the fork point is `git merge-base HEAD
 * <base>` taken before the merge. regen runs before the merge is committed,
 * so `HEAD` is still the branch tip, and the change it sees is the union of
 * what the branch did since the fork point (`<fork>...HEAD`) and what the
 * merge brought in (the working tree against `HEAD`).
 *
 * **Why this base.** A pair that union does not touch has identical inputs
 * in the merged tree, at the branch tip, at the fork point and at `<base>`'s
 * tip, because a three-way merge of a path neither side changed is that
 * path. Its answer here is its answer at every one of them, so it is
 * current if ANY of them was. The other two candidates need more:
 *
 * - the branch tip alone (`--changed HEAD`) skips a pair that only `<base>`
 *   left alone — sound only if the BRANCH was regen-clean;
 * - `<base>` alone skips a pair only the branch left alone — sound only if
 *   `<base>` was green, which CI on `main` does not guarantee.
 *
 * And it still sees the case regen exists for (bean `lxpq`): when both sides
 * touch one generated file, that file is in the union.
 *
 * What it does not do: repair a pair that was ALREADY stale at all three and
 * that the merge did not touch. That staleness is not the merge's, and the
 * branch's own CI reports it. `--full-regen`, or no fork point (a shallow
 * clone), runs the full set as before.
