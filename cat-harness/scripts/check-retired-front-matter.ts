/**
 * A front-matter key that was RETIRED must not come back.
 *
 * ## Why this check and not a schema
 *
 * The keys below were not wrong in shape — they parsed fine, validated fine,
 * and were consumed by nothing. That is the defect class this repository
 * keeps paying for: **declared but read by nothing**. A schema cannot catch
 * it, because a schema's job is to say what a valid value looks like and
 * every one of these carried valid values. `roles:` carried 325 of them.
 *
 * Nor can the removal defend itself. 140 files lost `roles:` on 2026-09-20,
 * and the corpus that taught every agent here to write it is the corpus in
 * front of them: copy an adjacent skill's front matter and the field is back.
 * That is how it reached 140 files in the first place — six arrived in the
 * qou migration and the rest is copy-paste, never a decision.
 *
 * ## What the registry buys over a grep
 *
 * The error names the **record**, not the rule. Somebody re-adding `roles:`
 * is usually right that a skill should say who performs it; they are wrong
 * about the field. Pointing them at `fsh-guts/retired/…` hands them the
 * census, the archaeology and the two questions the removal deliberately did
 * not answer, which is the difference between "don't" and "here is what was
 * tried".
 *
 * Adding the next retirement is one entry, and the entry is refused without
 * a record to point at — see {@link RETIRED}.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-retired-front-matter
 * @covers computed — its scan set is `kgRoots(instance)` — whichever kg graphs each instance
 *   declares — plus the `.claude/skills/` convention, which is not a declared graph at all. A
 *   literal list is what `known-skills.ts` was extracted to remove

/**
 * Where to sweep — EVERY directory the instance declares, plus two

 *
 * A hand-kept list is the failure `known-skills.ts` was extracted to remove:
 * its own header calls such a list "a copy that happens to match today", and
 * the copy it replaced had already stopped matching. A sweep blind to a
 * directory reports a clean run over files it never opened, which is worse
 * than not running at all.
 *
 * **Every declared directory, not a chosen few graph kinds.** Two earlier
 * versions of this function each went blind within a day:
 *
 * - `skillMdDirs` enumerates skill PACKAGES, and `skills/memory/` was not
 *   one — the sweep never opened the 26 entries the `roles` exemption
 *   exists for.
 * - Naming `beans` and `fsh-guts` by hand missed `memory` when it moved to
 *   the repository root as its own declared graph, hours later. The test
 *   asserting the exemption is non-vacuous is what caught it.
 *
 * Naming kinds is the same copy one level up. Sweeping everything declared
 * costs a directory walk over trees that hold no front matter and cannot go
 * blind when a graph is added.
 *
 * **Read RAW, not through `readDeclaration`.** That loader throws on a graph
 * kind no registry has seen yet — kinds are contributed at runtime, so which
 * are known depends on what has been imported. A check that refuses to run
 * because a kind it does not care about is unregistered is a check that goes
 * silent for an unrelated reason.
 *
 * `scope: "repository"` is honoured through `rootForScope`, or `fsh-guts/`,
 * `beans/` and `memory/` resolve inside the instance and find nothing.
