/**
 * Publish the declaration's JSON Schema at a dereferenceable `$id`.
 *
 * The other half of a self-describing graph. `<stub>.jsonld` says what this
 * instance contains; this says what a declaration *is*, and lives at the URL
 * its own `$id` names — so a consumer holding an `harness.json` it does
 * not understand has somewhere to go.
 *
 * ## The trick, from `WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base`
 *
 * `generate_logical_model_schemas.py` mints `$id` as
 * `{schema_base_url}/StructureDefinition-{model}.schema.json` — the URL the
 * file is actually served from — and `generate_dak_api_hub.py` then renders
 * each schema as browsable HTML at that address. The schema is not merely
 * *described* somewhere; it **is** its own documentation endpoint.
 *
 * Copied here with one deliberate difference. smart-base derives its schemas
 * from FHIR StructureDefinitions; ours derive from Zod, because
 * `directory-conventions` §"What lives in the `schemas` graph" settled that
 * the `.ts` is authoritative and every other form is generated. So this is a
 * third rendering of `CatHarnessDeclarationSchema`, beside the JSON-LD — not
 * a second authority.
 *
 * ## Why `$id` must be absolute or absent
 *
 * A relative `$id` is legal and useless: `$ref` resolution against it depends
 * on where the fetcher happened to get the file, so two consumers can resolve
 * the same schema differently. When no `canonicalUrl` is declared this writes
 * **no** `$id` rather than a plausible-looking relative one — the same rule
 * `kg-export` follows for `@id`, and for the same reason.
 *
 * @module scripts/harness-schema-export

 * `unproduced` catches a declaration that rotted: a Tool still claiming an
 * artefact this instance no longer writes, which a consumer of the published
 * graph would follow to a 404.
 *
 * `missingSource` is the third finding and a different failure again: the
 * declaration names a module that is not in the tree. That is not "the artefact
 * is wrong" — the artefact may be perfectly correct — it is the PROVENANCE
 * being unfollowable, and the remedy is the opposite (fix the path, not the
 * build).
 *
 * ## `unproduced` is scoped to what THIS command writes, and that is a narrowing
 *
 * It was not, until 2026-09-20. `maintains` says a Tool is authoritative for a
 * published artefact; it never said the artefact is produced by the schema
 * exporter. The three original carriers all happened to be, so the check was
 * written against that coincidence and reported the first counterexample as
 * drift: `ns-vocabulary` and `content-context` maintain `ns/vocabulary.jsonld`
 * and `ns/content/v1.jsonld`, which `.github/workflows/docs-site.yml` publishes
 * — both declarations true, both flagged. (The union was retired on 2026-09-30;
 * `ns-vocabulary` now maintains each layer's `<stub>/ns.jsonld`.)
 *
 * So the comparison now runs only over artefacts whose declaring Tool invokes
 * this command. That keeps the rot guarantee exactly where this script can
 * honour it and stops it claiming one it cannot: this script has no way to know
 * whether the site build wrote a file into `_site/`, and a check that answers a
 * question it cannot see is worse than one that declines to.
 *
 * **Coverage of the others is therefore now absent HERE, not merely narrower** —
 * an artefact maintained by some other producer can rot to a 404 and nothing in
 * this script notices. That was the honest cost of the narrowing, and it is now
 * paid: `scripts/check-maintained-artefacts.ts` asks the same question where the
 * answer exists, against the assembled `_site/` rather than against this script's
 * output, and treats an unbuilt tree as could-not-determine rather than as a pass.
 * Bean `6f1x`.
 *
 * `undeclared` is unchanged and still runs over everything produced: a file this
 * command writes with no Tool declaring it is the drift that put this relation
 * in a local array until 2026-09-19, and that direction needs no scoping.

 *
 * ## Public Zod schemas — listed when a scan is passed in
 *
 * Until 2026-10-05 none were, because no rule said which exports are public:
 * the JSON-LD's schema-node collector is instance-bound (`COLLECTOR_SCOPE` in
 * `kg-export.ts`) and yields MODULES, not Zod values. The owner then made the
 * rule (option C, "every exported *Schema" — see the section above): every
 * exported `*Schema` const that is a Zod schema, rendered under `zod/` and
 * listed in `$defs` by `$id` beside the contracts.
 *
 * The scan is ASYNC (it imports modules) and this builder is not, so the scan
 * is an argument: {@link scanInstanceZodSchemas} first, then this. Without one
 * the index keeps `omitted: ["schemas"]`, exactly as before, so "not looked
 * for" still cannot read as "there are none"; with an undetermined one it
 * keeps it too. A determined scan drops it — the absence of `zod/` entries is
 * then a measured zero. Failures go to `zodProblems` and to the index's
