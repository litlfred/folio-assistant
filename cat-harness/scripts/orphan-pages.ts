/**
 * ONE selector for "did this generator write this page, HERE?".
 *
 * Bean `s8nu`. Four selectors existed for one question, and `y90d` predicted
 * the fourth in advance — *"do not write a fifth"* — then wrote one, because
 * at that moment the third was not yet importable. This module is the third
 * being importable, so there is no reason left to mint another.
 *
 * ## Why a generator needs this at all
 *
 * A generator that writes and never deletes leaves a page serving a subject
 * the declaration no longer describes, at a URL nothing links to. `--check`
 * cannot see it: it inspects only the files it is about to write, so it finds
 * a page that is WRONG and never one that SHOULD NOT EXIST. Bean `ankg`,
 * found live when #604's rename left `folio-assist-sci/index.html` behind.
 *
 * ## What is parameterised, and what deliberately is not
 *
 * The **ownership test** is the parameter. The **unit** is not: this walks
 * directories that hold an `index.html`, full stop.
 *
 * That split is the substance rather than a tidy-up. `s8nu` proposed the
 * ownership test as the axis and expected all four selectors to become call
 * sites, but two of them do not share this unit at all — `prunableStickies`
 * walks flat `.json` FILES, and `who-iris`'s `OWNED`/`OWNED_LIB`/`OWNED_DOCS`
 * match flat filenames because that site publishes no subject directories.
 * The bean names generalising the unit as *"a real design step rather than a
 * rename"* for `OWNED`, and does not notice `prunableStickies` sits on the
 * same side of that line. Widening this to cover them would be that design
 * step taken silently, so it is not taken here.
 *
 * ## Both callers gained something they did not have
 *
 * The two that DO share the unit each held a rule the other lacked, which is
 * the argument for one implementation rather than two correct ones:
 *
 * - `orphanSubjectPages` reported a non-owned directory as **`foreign`** — a
 *   third state, listed and left alone. `prunableDashboards` dropped it
 *   silently, so a page it did not recognise and a directory it had examined
 *   and cleared looked identical.
 * - `prunableDashboards` treated an unreadable page as **not ours**, because
 *   a file we cannot read is one we cannot prove we wrote.
 *   `orphanSubjectPages` called `readFileSync` bare and would have THROWN on
 *   one — a generator aborting rather than reporting.
 *
 * Both behaviours are kept here. Neither was invented for this module.
 *
 * @module scripts/orphan-pages
