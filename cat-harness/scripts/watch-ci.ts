/**
 * Watch ONE commit's checks to a verdict, in three states.
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run cat ci:watch <sha>                    # poll until decided
 * bun run cat ci:watch <sha> --branch main      # which branch explains a cancellation
 * bun run cat ci:watch <sha> --once             # one look, no polling
 * bun run cat ci:watch --pr <n>                 # follow a PR's head, re-read every poll
 * ```
 *
 * Exit codes carry the third state, because a caller that reads "not 1" as
 * success rebuilds the collapse this exists to stop:
 *
 * ```
 * 0  pass          every judgeable check completed clean
 * 1  fail          a check failed, timed out, or needs action
 * 2  undetermined  cancelled/superseded, still pending, no runs, or unreadable
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why this is not `check:ci-health`
 *
 * That asks whether the **workflows** are passing on the default branch across
 * recent history. This asks about **one commit**: may I merge, must I fix, or
 * do I not yet know? A workflow can be healthy while one commit's run was
 * cancelled, and a commit can be green while a workflow has been red for a
 * month on a path it never touched.
 *
 * ## Why it exists
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-30: an agent watching `main` after a merge folded
 * `cancelled` into failure and reported **main red** on a commit whose every
 * hard gate had passed. The cancelled run was a deploy job superseded by the
 * next push. See {@link ../src/workflow/check-verdict} for the full account and
 * the precedence rules, which are pure and tested there rather than here.
 *
 * `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` is used when present. Without one the call
 * still works for a public repository; for a private one it fails, and this
 * reports `undetermined` rather than a pass.
 *
