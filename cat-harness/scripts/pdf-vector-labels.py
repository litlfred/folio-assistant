"""Recover the positioned TEXT on a page that declares a figure. Bean `a8wy`, under `m4xy`.

`pdf-images.py` recovers the RASTER layer. WHO's conceptual figures --
frameworks, maturity models, taxonomies, process flows -- are drawn in path
operators and text, so there is no image object and that arm places nothing:
`9789240120747-eng` declares six captioned figures and places zero images, and
`check-l1-complete` reported "0 image(s), 0 describable and all described" over
it. This reads the other layer and writes `vector-labels.json` beside it.

The contract and every measurement behind it are in `schemas/vector-labels.ts`,
which this mirrors and does not restate. Four decisions drive the code below,
and a reader of the script would reasonably change them without these:

  * THE UNIT IS A LINE, not a block. MuPDF's block segmentation merges labels
    that are nowhere near each other: on `9789240010567-eng` page 25 one block
    holds six circled numerals spread over 200pt, and another holds
    `HEALTH USE CASE` and `HEALTH PROGRAMME` -- the titles of two DIFFERENT
    architectures. Lines do not merge that way, and a line's spans concatenate
    into readable text.

  * `intersectsDrawing` IS RECORDED AND NEVER FILTERED ON. On the handbook's
    page 34 it separates perfectly -- 149 labels on the drawing, and the 4 that
    are not are the running head, the page number, the caption and the source
    line. On `9789240010567-eng` page 25 it is false for 30 labels that are
    plainly figure content (`SILOED`, `MUD`, `INTEGRATED`, `EXCHANGED`, their
    glosses, and both axis labels), because those sit in the white space
    BETWEEN the drawn boxes.

  * THE PAGE QUALIFIES ON THE CAPTION, LOOSELY, AND THE ERROR IS DELIBERATE.
    Any line-start `Fig.`/`Figure` + number, on a page with a vector layer,
    minus table-of-contents entries. That admits pages whose only match is a
    cross-reference (`Fig. 4.5.1 highlights the major considerations`), and the
    over-inclusion is chosen: a false positive costs a page of prose in the
    sidecar, a false negative loses a figure's labels entirely, which is the
    whole point of the arm. Same asymmetry `document-image.ts` argues for
    `chrome`.

  * WHAT IS EXCLUDED IS EXCLUDED STRUCTURALLY, not by a tuned number. A
    table-of-contents entry carries a DOT LEADER; nothing else here does.
    `m4xy` refuses a coverage threshold because one chosen after seeing this
    corpus is chosen to fit the answer -- a leader is a typographic fact, not a
    percentile.

Never claims absence it did not establish: no backend, or a document that will
not open, yields `pages: null` with a reason -- NOT an empty list. An empty
list is the determined finding that no page declares a figure over a vector
layer.
