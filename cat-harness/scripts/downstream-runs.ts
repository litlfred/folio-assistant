/**
 * The downstream-tool criterion family — one evaluator for every Tool that
 * declares `downstream`, generalising what `lsi-index-fresh` did for LSI alone.
 *
 * @module scripts/downstream-runs
 *
 * Bean `fq5u`. The owner's design: every downstream tool is a Tool node
 * declaring its output and inputs (`schemas/tool.ts#ToolDownstreamSchema`);
 * each run writes a `folio-tool-run/v1` record (`schemas/tool-run.ts`); QA
 * reads **fresh** only for a successful run over the current inputs, **stale**
 * when an input moved since, and **not-run / failed** — never green — when
 * there is no successful record.
 *
 * `kg:audit` projects two criteria from here:
 *
 * - `tool-downstream-fresh`, per Tool — the three-state verdict over each of
 *   its targets, or `unknown` naming the publish verifier for an output that
 *   exists only in an assembled site;
 * - `downstream-tool-declared`, once per run — a downstream tool that is NOT
 *   declared: a member reader, a run record or a publish verifier naming a
 *   Tool with no `downstream` declaration.
 *
 * ## Members
 *
 * {@link MEMBERS} maps a Tool id to the function that enumerates its targets
 * and reads each one's state with the tool's OWN fingerprint (see
 * `schemas/tool-run.ts` for why not a generic file hash). A `checkout`-judged
 * declaration with no member cannot be judged, which is `unknown`, not a pass.
 * Adding a member is one entry here plus the Tool's declaration; the criteria
 * need no change.

 * record naming one, and a publish verifier that says it judges one.
 *
 * ## Records that are not in the checkout are `unknown`, never a pass
 *
 * Bean `oq1j` (reader `R26`). The run records are derived QA bound for the
 * `qa-reports` branch. With no record directory to list, the record half of
 * the question was not asked ({@link listToolRuns}). The entry is then
 * `unknown`, and it carries the reason as a finding beside whatever the other
 * two halves found. `unknown` outranks `fail`, the rule `qa-results.ts`'s
 * judge mode keeps: a sweep blind on one part has not cleared the others.
 * Returning the findings alone, as this did, would make an unlisted directory
 * a quiet pass.
