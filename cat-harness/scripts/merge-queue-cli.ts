/**
 * `merge:queue:read` and `merge:queue:record` — the queue, from the command line.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/merge-queue-cli
 * @covers none — a command over the `merge-queue` graph; `merge-queue-store.ts` judges it
 *
 * Bean `najo`. `merge-queue.ts` computes an order and writes nothing by design;
 * `merge-steward.ts` reads GitHub and prints that order. Neither could RECORD
 * what the steward decided, because the graph was on `main` and the steward may
 * not open a pull request. This is the write path, and the read that pairs with
 * it.
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run merge:queue:read                 # the recorded decisions
 * bun run merge:queue:read --json
 * bun run merge:queue:record --pr 2065 --class standard --rank 3 --rule Rule_HarnessSmallClean \
 *     --reason "clean, green, unblocks the queue graph" --by https://claude.ai/code/session_…
 * bun run merge:queue:record --pr 2065 --position 1 --reason "owner, 2026-10-04: land it first" --by owner
 * bun run merge:queue:record --file entry.json      # or `-` for stdin
 * ```
 *
 * ## Exit codes, and why a read has three failures rather than one
 *
 * `0` read (or recorded) · `1` the queue is `declared-but-absent` · `2` usage
 * · `4` **unreachable** · `5` the write was refused or conflicted.
 *
 * `1` and `4` are different because their remedies are: one says the
 * declaration and the disk disagree, the other says this checkout has not
 * mounted the branch (`bun run state:mount`). Collapsing them prints the wrong
 * one, and a reader acting on it would "fix" a declaration that is correct —
 * `dh4f`. Neither is ever exit 0 with an empty table.
