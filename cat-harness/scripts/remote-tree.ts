/**
 * ONE REMOTE TREE AT ONE PIN — the fetch primitive under a remote mount and a
 * KG materialisation.
 *
 * @module scripts/remote-tree
 * @graphNode none — a library: it fetches and reads, and judges nothing
 *
 * Bean `0mpw`. `gitPartFetcher` lived in `folio-assistant-core/scripts/
 * kg-materialize.ts` until the remote mount needed it, and cat-harness may not
 * import core (`check:reference-direction` — a wrong-direction edge). So it
 * moved DOWN, unchanged in behaviour, and core re-exports it; the remote mount
 * reads through the same {@link RemoteTree} rather than a second copy of
 * "shallow, blobless, one commit, sparse checkout".
 *
 * A {@link RemoteTree} fetches once per (repository, commit) and answers every
 * question about that tree from it: listing a directory and reading a small
 * file cost trees and one blob, never a checkout; {@link RemoteTree.checkout}
 * then materialises exactly the paths asked for. A gitlink (a submodule entry)
 * is reported as one — `kind: "commit"` with its pinned SHA — and never
 * followed silently: the caller decides whether that pin names another tree.
