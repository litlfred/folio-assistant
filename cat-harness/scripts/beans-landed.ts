/**
 * Open beans whose work has already merged — REPORTED, never closed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run beans:landed          # strong findings, then a count of the rest
 *   bun run beans:landed --all    # every finding
 *   bun run beans:landed --days 60
 *
 * Bean `4d22`. The PR merges, the agent then commits the bean's completion to
 * the branch, then re-branches from the new `main`, and that completion commit
 * is orphaned: the bean still reads open on `main`. The rule that prevents it
 * is in `skills/folio-core/bean-coordination.md` §"Complete it in the PR's own
 * last commit". This is the report for what slips through.
 *
 * ## The signal, and why it is ranked rather than listed
 *
 * A merged PR's title names its bean by convention (`gpdo: …`), and GitHub
 * puts the title in the merge commit: as the subject when the merge is titled,
 * as the first body line when it is the default "Merge pull request #N from
 * …". So an OPEN bean named there may be finished and unrecorded.
 *
 * May, not is. Measured 2026-09-23 over 30 days: 39 of 251 open beans were
 * named. 8 were epics, which are named by many PRs and stay open by design, so
 * they are excluded. Of the 31 left:
 *
 * - `done-ticked` (1): every `## Done when` box ticked, status still open.
 *   That is the orphan shape itself, and it is listed first.
 * - `partly-ticked` (23): some boxes open. Often a PR that did part of the
 *   work, which is legitimate.
 * - `no-checklist` (7): nothing to read either way.
 *
 * ## Three states for the whole run
 *
 * A shallow clone has no merge history, and "no findings" would then be a
 * lie. With no merge commits visible in the window, the run says it could not
 * determine anything rather than reporting clean.
 *
 * It closes nothing. `bean-coordination.md` §"Closing a bean whose work has
 * already landed": a bean closes on evidence you re-derive, never on a report.
 *
