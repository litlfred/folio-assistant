# Publish `_site` to `gh-pages` as a FULL REPLACE, surviving a lost push race.
#
# Replaces `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` in `docs-site.yml`. Bean `yzsj`,
# issue #605 half (a), on the owner's ruling.
#
# ## Why the action had to go
#
# `docs-site` fires on every push to `main` and is the busiest writer of
# `gh-pages` after `feature-staging`. It had NO retry: `peaceiris` clones,
# replaces and pushes in one step, so the race window is INSIDE the action and
# there is nothing to wrap. Measured failing on `main` 2026-09-20 at 19:53
# (run 308, 4af80f84cf):
#
#   ! [rejected]        gh-pages -> gh-pages (fetch first)
#
# It self-healed on the next merge, which is why it stayed invisible.
#
# ## Why a REBASE would have been the wrong retry — the part that matters
#
# `feature-staging` retries by rebasing, and that is right for IT: its commit
# adds or removes one `STAGING/<slug>/` directory, so replaying it onto whoever
# won touches nothing else.
#
# This commit replaces the WHOLE TREE. Rebasing it onto a newer `gh-pages`
# would re-apply that replacement over whatever landed in between — deleting a
# preview a sibling had just deployed. That is bean `plj1` exactly, re-created
# by the very mechanism meant to make the deploy safer.
#
# So each attempt REBUILDS instead of replaying: re-read the branch, re-run the
# restore against its CURRENT contents, lay `_site` down again, commit, push.
# `restore-staging.ts` reads `gh-pages` itself (`ls-remote` / `ls-tree`), so a
# second call sees the newer branch rather than a cached view.
#
# That makes the retry strictly BETTER than one attempt, not merely luckier.
# `docs-site.yml` already names the flaw it closes: the restore runs, then the
# action re-clones, and "everything between this read and that clone is a
# window in which a `feature-staging` deploy could land a preview this push
# then removes". Re-restoring per attempt shrinks that window to the last
# attempt's, instead of carrying the first attempt's stale read into a push
# minutes later.
#
# ## What is preserved from the action, deliberately
#
#   - FULL REPLACE, via `git rm -r --ignore-unmatch '*'` — the exact call
#     `peaceiris` makes in `src/git-utils.ts` (`setRepo`). Not `keep_files`:
#     `docs-site.yml` records at length why that is not the fix, and the
#     previews are kept by RESTORING them into `_site`, not by never deleting.
#   - the commit message `docs(gh-pages): site from <sha>`, which
#     `check-ci-health` and the render log both read.
#   - "nothing to commit" is success, not failure: a deploy that changes
#     nothing is a no-op, not a broken build.
#
# The `--verify` step in the workflow is untouched and still runs after this.
# A green push is not evidence here (`plj1`), and this script does not pretend
# otherwise — it publishes, and something else checks.
#
# Env: SITE, STATE, COMMIT_SHA, PAGES_DIR (all required; no defaults, because a
# silent default here publishes the wrong directory to the live site).
