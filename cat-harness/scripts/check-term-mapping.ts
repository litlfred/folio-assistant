/**
 * Is a minted glossary candidate already somebody else's concept?
 *
 * Bean `7wou`, under `5yhm`. The check the owner asked for on 2026-09-29:
 * *"extracting exsiting glossary needs compaision to existing
 * termonology/coding."* The contract, the three states and why `exact` and
 * `concept` are a pair are in `schemas/term-mapping.ts` and are not restated
 * here. Three things decide what the code below does:
 *
 *   * TWO TARGETS, NEVER MERGED. `skos` is authoritative for meaning, `fhir`
 *     for a clinical code's operational semantics, and the owner was explicit
 *     2026-09-30: "OCL is only for FHIR. not a constraint on SKOS." So there
 *     are two resolvers and two sets of results, and a term can be mapped in
 *     one and unmapped in the other without contradiction.
 *
 *   * A RESOLVER THAT CANNOT BE REACHED RETURNS `undetermined`, WITH ITS
 *     REASON — never `unmapped`. In this checkout that is not hypothetical:
 *     the network policy refuses `api.openconceptlab.org:443`, so every
 *     `fhir` row is undetermined and says so, while `skos` resolves locally
 *     and returns real verdicts.
 *
 *   * IT REPORTS AND NEVER GRADES. No ratio, no threshold, no exit code that
 *     depends on how many mapped. An unmapped candidate may be a term this
 *     corpus is right to coin.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/check-term-mapping.ts
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/check-term-mapping.ts --check   # fail if stale
 *
 * @module scripts/check-term-mapping
