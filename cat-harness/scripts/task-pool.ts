/**
 * A bounded worker pool for gate and regen runs — bean `xpcu`.
 *
 * @module scripts/task-pool
 * @graphNode none — a scheduling helper for `gates.ts` and `regen-after-merge.ts`
 *
 * ## Why it exists
 *
 * Measured on 2026-10-01 on a shared 4-CPU box: `bun run regen` asked ~84
 * verify/write pairs one after another (~25 min), and `bun run gates` ran ~200
 * gates one after another (50+ min). Most of that is waiting on one `bun`
 * process at a time while three cores idle.
 *
 * ## The one rule that makes concurrency safe here: OUTPUTS, declared
 *
 * Two tasks may run at the same time only when neither can write where the
 * other reads or writes. That is decided from DECLARED paths
 * (`task-io.ts`), never guessed:
 *
 * - a task with `outputs: undefined` (nothing declared) **conflicts with
 *   everything**, so it runs alone — exactly as it did before this module;
 * - two declared tasks conflict when one's outputs overlap the other's outputs
 *   or declared inputs ({@link pathsOverlap}).
 *
 * Conflicting tasks also keep their ORIGINAL ORDER: a task is never started
 * ahead of an earlier task it conflicts with. So an undeclared task is a
 * barrier — everything before it finishes first and nothing after it starts
 * until it is done — which is the serial behaviour, kept wherever the
 * declaration that would justify anything else is missing.
 *
 * `regen` adds one more rule on top, {@link ReadWriteGate}: its checks are the
 * readers and its writers are serialized against everything, because a writer
 * has no output declaration to be scheduled by.
 *
 * ## Output stays in the original order
 *
 * Results are reported through {@link orderedEmitter}, which holds a finished
 * task's output until every task before it has been printed. The log of a
 * parallel run therefore reads exactly like the serial one, and two runs of the
 * same tree print the same lines in the same order.
