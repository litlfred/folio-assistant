/**
 * Is this checkout's ENVIRONMENT telling the truth about the repository?
 *
 * Every gate here answers a question about what the repository contains. This
 * script answers a prior one: *could any answer be trusted at all?* — because a
 * tool that resolves a module, walks a directory or counts a corpus reads the
 * filesystem, and the filesystem holds things the repository does not.
 *
 * ## Three measured instances of one shape
 *
 * | bean | the residue | what it distorted |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `xd1g` | `block-qa-schema/node_modules` + `dist` | `kg-detangle` counted **1214** phantom KG nodes |
 * | `qook` | a SYMLINKED root `node_modules` | `gitCorpus` handed every consumer one phantom path |
 * | `3vc1` | a nested REAL `node_modules` | root `tsc` resolves a different SDK and reports **12** errors in **6** files |
 *
 * Each is *"a tool answered a question about the repository and the answer came
 * from something the repository does not contain"*.
 *
 * `3vc1` is the one that makes this worth a guard rather than a note, because it
 * is a **TRAP and not a mistake**: a stale nested lockfile can only be fixed by
 * `bun install` **in that directory**, there is no other way to regenerate a
 * lockfile, and that install is what creates the distortion. Doing the correct
 * thing is what breaks the reading, and nothing warns you. Measured 2026-09-26:
 * it cost a full `bun run gates` cycle, and the false red arrived alongside two
 * unrelated test failures, so the reading was wrong in three places at once and
 * none of them named a `node_modules`.
 *
 * ## Exit codes — this is a THIRD STATE, never a finding
 *
 *     0  the environment matches what the repository declares
 *     2  distorted: a reading taken now cannot be trusted
 *
 * **There is deliberately no exit 1.** A distortion is not a defect in this
 * repository's source, and `nytj` is the rule it follows: a gate that cannot run
 * must not read as green — and equally must not read as a finding. `gates.ts`
 * consults this BEFORE running anything and refuses the whole run, because 168
 * gate results computed against a lying filesystem are worse than no results:
 * they look like evidence.
 *
 * ## Why this is a precondition and not one of the gates
 *
 * CI installs only from the repository root, so this condition cannot arise
 * there — a workflow step would be a gate that can never fire, which reads as
 * protection and is not (the `build-glossary` dead-guard defect `gates.ts` names
 * elsewhere). It is exempt in `SCRIPT_EXEMPTIONS` with that reason rather than
 * wired into a workflow to satisfy `check:unrun-scripts`.
 *
 * ```sh
 * bun run check:environment          # 0 clean, 2 distorted
 * ```
 *
 * @covers schemas
 * @graphNode tool

/**
 * Are two versions close enough that a typecheck cannot tell them apart?
 *
 * ## Why MAJOR.MINOR, and why this line is evidence rather than principle
 *
 * The first version of this compared versions for EQUALITY, and that was a false
 * positive — caught by running it, not by reasoning about it. Bean `3vc1`'s own fix
 * regenerated `adapters/mcp-server`'s stale lockfile, which took the nested SDK from
 * 1.28.0 to 1.30.1 against the root's 1.30.0. Root `tsc` then reported **0 errors**
 * while this guard still said DISTORTED and refused every gate run.
 *
 * Two measurements, and they bracket the line:
 *
 * | nested vs root | differs at | root `tsc --noEmit` |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 1.28.0 vs 1.30.0 | **minor** | **12 errors in 6 files** |
 * | 1.30.1 vs 1.30.0 | **patch** | **0 errors** |
 *
 * So major-only would have missed the case this guard exists for, and exact equality
 * refuses a harmless tree. Major.minor is the only line the evidence supports.
 *
 * **Stated as a heuristic, because it is one.** Whether a version difference changes
 * a typecheck cannot be known without typechecking twice, which is the thing this
 * runs BEFORE. A patch release that changed a type would slip past — and that is the
 * failure this accepts in exchange for not refusing a correctly set-up checkout,
 * which is the worse of the two and was measured: the equality version blocked
 * `bun run gates` on a tree whose typecheck was clean.
 *
 * A malformed version is treated as NOT matching, so an unreadable pair is reported
 * rather than waved through — `could not tell` belongs on the refusing side here,
 * because the alternative is a silent pass.

/**
 * Does any `.ts` under `dir` (excluding installs) import `name`?
 *
 * ## Why the predicate is IMPORTS and not "there is a nested install"
 *
 * A first version of this script reported every nested `node_modules` as a
 * distortion, and that is **wrong** — measured before it shipped, which is the
 * only reason it is not in the history. `cat-harness/schemas/block-qa-schema`
 * is a declared sub-package with its OWN `bun.lock` and `package.json`, so its
 * `node_modules` is the expected result of installing it. Refusing on that would
 * have blocked every local gate run in a correctly set-up checkout: a far worse
 * defect than the one this guards.
 *
 * "Inside the root `tsconfig.json`'s `include`" does not discriminate either.
 * BOTH directories are inside it — `cat-harness/adapters/**` and
 * `cat-harness/schemas/**` — and only one causes errors.
 *
 * What discriminates is measured:
 *
 * | nested install | shadows | its sources import it? | root `tsc` |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | `adapters/mcp-server` | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.28.0 vs 1.30.0 | **yes**, 4+ files | **12 errors in 6 files** |
 * | `schemas/block-qa-schema` | `typescript` 7.0.2 vs 6.0.3, `commander` | **no** | 0 errors |
 *
 * So a nested install matters exactly when the sources beside it import a package
 * it resolves differently from the root. Anything else is a sub-package doing what
 * it is declared to do, and saying so would be noise that trains a reader to
 * ignore this check.
