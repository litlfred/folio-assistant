/**
 * Read every declared `voices` directory — the voices, their rules, and the
 * citation each rule carries.
 *
 * @module scripts/voices-graph
 * @graphNode none — a reader over the voices graph, not a schema itself
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The subsystem's whole claim is that a voice is **auditable rather than
 * asserted**. `check-voices.ts` exists because PR #210 shipped three WHO
 * profiles carrying ten plausible rules each with `source: null` — and one of
 * those plausible rules asserted the OPPOSITE of what the WHO Editorial Style
 * Manual says on p14. Every rule now carries the page and the quote it was
 * read from.
 *
 * **And nobody could read a single one of them without opening JSON.** A
 * citation that is only machine-checked is a citation the reader takes on
 * trust, which is the state the citations were added to end. Bean `bu2q`.
 *
 * ## Three declarations, and one of them is empty
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-21: `who-style-guide`, `folio-assistant-sci` and
 * `agent-skills` declare a `voices` graph. `agent-skills/voices/` **is not
 * there** (bean `26tu`), so this reader reports it as a declared directory
 * with no voices rather than omitting it. Those are different facts: the
 * first is a gap somebody should close, the second is an instance that never
 * claimed to have any.
 *
 * ## A voice that will not load THROWS
 *
 * `loadVoices` throws on a malformed voice and this reader does not catch it.
 * A malformed voice must not present as an instance with fewer voices: the
 * second is a legitimate state and the first is a defect, and collapsing them
 * is the false-clean this repository keeps paying for. Same rule as
 * `shippedVoices` in `content/pipeline/voice-criteria.ts`, which is the other
 * cross-instance reader over this graph.
