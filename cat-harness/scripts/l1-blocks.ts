/**
 * The arm between a staged entry and a promotable one: `manifest.jsonld` and
 * one `blocks/*.jsonld` per section.
 *
 * ## Why this did not exist, and what that cost
 *
 * `ingest-document.ts` stages a document and then prints *"run the remaining
 * arms"*. Measured 2026-09-20 while ingesting the agent-skill corpus: of the
 * five requirements a staged entry still fails, `images` names its arm
 * (`pdf-images.py`) and **`blocks`, `manifest` and `narrative-provenance`
 * named nothing at all** — there was no script to run. `mayPromote` requires
 * every requirement met, so `bun run ingest` could stage a document and
 * nothing could ever promote one.
 *
 * That is not a missing feature, it is a pipeline that cannot terminate, and
 * it was invisible because both ends looked healthy: staging exits 0 and says
 * `✓ staged`, and `check:l1-complete` passes over `library/` because the four
 * entries already THERE were built before the pipeline was assembled. The
 * eight PDFs sitting unprocessed in `uploads/` are what it actually looked
 * like from outside.
 *
 * ## It DERIVES; it does not decide
 *
 * Every field here is computed from `structure.json` and the files beside it.
 * Nothing is inferred, and in particular **no block kind is guessed**: every
 * block is `prose`, because a page of an ingested source IS prose until
 * somebody reads it, and a classifier that guessed `theorem` from a heading
 * would be `6xaz` one layer up. Deliberate, not a stub.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/l1-blocks.ts -o <staged-entry-dir>
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/l1-blocks.ts -o <dir> --check   # write nothing
 *
 * Exit: 0 written (or check passed), 1 refused, 2 could not determine.
 *
 * @module scripts/l1-blocks

// The generator's own naming, imported rather than restated. Bean `xwi8`: this

// `gen-library-jsonld` mints `prose-sec-001` through `sectionKey()`, and only
// the generator's names are what sections reference. Every document that went
// through both writers therefore carried a second, unreferenced, byte-identical
// copy of every prose block: 91 of them across four documents when measured
// (2026-09-23). Two naming rules for one block is one rule too many.
