/**
 * The guard has to FAIL on each contradiction it claims to catch, and to stay
 * SILENT on the two shapes that look like one and are not.
 *
 * Written against temp stores rather than the real one on purpose: the real
 * corpus has zero findings in one direction and one baselined finding in the
 * other, so a test that only asserted "the repo passes" would go on passing if
 * the checker were gutted to `return []`.
 *
 * Two of these cases are regressions against mistakes made while writing it.
 * The childless-`feature` case is the first draft's own false positive — nine
 * beans reported as containers whose work was finished, when they had no
 * children at all. The unjudged case is the sweep refusing to convict 47 beans
 * of the GitHub API being unreachable.
