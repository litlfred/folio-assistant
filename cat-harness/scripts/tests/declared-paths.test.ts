/**
 * No file gains a hardcoded path that `harness.json` already declares.
 *
 * ## Why a test and not a CI flag
 *
 * Same answer as `activity-skill-coverage.test.ts`: the property was just
 * established and this asserts exactly it. The gate itself ships as a
 * ratchet — 125 sites of recorded debt that may only shrink — so what a test
 * can pin down is the *shape* of the property, not a clean slate.
 *
 * ## The three assertions, and what each would miss alone
 *
 *  - **The scan is non-empty.** Without it, renaming a source directory turns
 *    every assertion below into a vacuous pass. Same guard its sibling opens
 *    with, and for the same reason.
 *  - **No file exceeds its baseline.** The ratchet.
 *  - **Every marked site carries a reason.** The exemption is the escape
 *    hatch, and an exemption with no reason is a rubber stamp — the rule
 *    `<folio:no-skill reason="…"/>` already enforces at load time.
 *  - **Every literal classed as an artefact dereferences.** The classifier
 *    only admits a literal that resolved when it ran; re-asserting it here is
 *    what makes the `blv9` close (a link-shaped value that does not
 *    dereference) a property of the corpus rather than of one run.
