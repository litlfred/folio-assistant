/**
 * `qrlc` — the live-vs-latent probe.
 *
 * The corpus-level cases live with the conversions
 * (`git-corpus-conversions.test.ts`). These are about the probe's own
 * honesty: the three ways it could manufacture a clearance, and the
 * derivation that keeps it from needing a roster.
 *
 * Its end-to-end falsifier is not here because it needs a second checkout:
 * run against `a0f7719032e~1`, the probe must call `kg:detangle` **LIVE** and
 * name `schemas.detangle.json` first — the artefact `biz4` measured going 233
 * to 1443 — while on the fixed code it must call it latent. Both were measured
 * 2026-09-27 and both held. Recorded here so the next reader knows the
 * falsifier exists and how to re-run it, rather than inferring it from a
 * passing unit suite.
