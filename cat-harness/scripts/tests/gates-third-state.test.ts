/**
 * The gate runner's third state — bean `6366`.
 *
 * `bun run gates` exited 0 or 1 only, so **"every gate passed"** and **"I could
 * not work out what the gates ARE"** were the same answer. That is the failure
 * this repository names everywhere else: could-not-determine is never rendered
 * as clean, and it outranks a finding.
 *
 * ## What was actually wrong, which is not what the bean's criterion implied
 *
 * `loadGates` was already right. It refuses **both** shapes — the workflow file
 * absent, and the file present but yielding no commands — and its message says
 * why: *"no gate commands were extracted. That is not a clean sweep, it is a
 * broken reader."*
 *
 * The defect was in the CLI, which let that throw escape as an uncaught
 * exception. So a could-not-determine arrived as exit **1**, indistinguishable
 * from a real gate failure. The fix therefore adds no detection; it translates a
 * refusal the library already makes into the right exit code.
 *
 * That is also why there is no `gates.length === 0` test below: such a branch
 * cannot fire, because `loadGates` throws first. Asserting on a guard that
 * cannot execute is how a dead guard reads as protection — the defect already
 * paid for in `build-glossary.ts`, where `resolve("")` returned the cwd and the
 * `!existsSync` check never fired.
 *
