/**
 * The e2e QA fixtures keep the SHAPE the generator writes.
 *
 * `qa-badge.e2e.ts` and `qa-panel.e2e.ts` read `test/results/witnesses/…` at
 * load until bean `cxcn` (reader audit R72/R73). That tree is derived and is
 * leaving `main` (bean `5hox`), so the specs now read committed copies under
 * `test/support/fixtures/qa-e2e/`. Their headers argued for the live corpus on
 * one ground: a hand-made fixture can agree with the code while the code
 * disagrees with what the generator writes. This test is what answers that for
 * a copy — it holds each fixture to the declared contract, so a change to the
 * generator's output shape fails here rather than leaving the specs testing a
 * format nothing produces any more.
 *
 * Verdicts in the fixtures are NOT asserted, here or in the specs: the specs
 * pin the ones they assert through `test/support/` helpers.
