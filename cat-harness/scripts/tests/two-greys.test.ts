/**
 * "Nothing to open" and "opens, refuses an edit" are two greys, not one.
 *
 * Bean `10s1`, owner 2026-09-21: *"if we have a materialized
 * `<stub>/<sub-graph>`, the contents of it should be immutable … you would need
 * to copy/materialize it to your own `folio/` in order to mess around with
 * it."*
 *
 * A listing that renders both states the same way tells a reader *"there is
 * nothing here"* about content that is present, complete and deliberately
 * frozen — and then the copy-out, the only way to work on it, has nowhere to be
 * offered from.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and at which layer
 *
 * The DATA, `_data/harness.json`, because that is what every surface reads. The
 * CSS says a read-only tile is dashed rather than dimmed and the JS puts the
 * state in the `aria-label`; neither is asserted here, where they would be
 * assertions about a spelling. What matters is that the two facts arrive
 * separable.

  /**
   * THE CORPUS CANNOT YET TELL THE TWO GREYS APART, and that is measured
   * rather than assumed.
   *
   * The first version of this file asserted that some read-only kind also has
   * a viewer — otherwise, it reasoned, the two facts are perfectly correlated
   * and the distinction is decorative. **It failed**, on 3 of 3 frozen kinds.
   *
   * The cause is NOT that `readOnly` is derived from path absence: it is read
   * from the declaration, and the fixture assertions in
   * `read-only-graphs.test.ts` exercise every combination. It is
   * `harness-tiles.ts` discovering a viewer only at a CONVENTIONAL path —
   * `who-iris/catalogue` has one, at `who-iris/docs/catalogue.html`, and that
   * generator reports it as built-but-unlinked rather than as a `path`
   * (`viewer-undiscovered.test.ts`, same measurement from the other side).
   *
   * **A merge from `main` moved this, and not all the way.** Declaration-based
   * discovery now fills the gap for a declared ref UNDER the published site
   * directory, which is how `who-iris/uploads` acquired a `path` — so the
   * corpus now holds a kind that has a viewer AND an explicit `readOnly`,
   * and the two fields are visibly independent rather than only structurally
   * so. `who-iris/catalogue` still does not resolve, because its viewer lives
   * in the instance's own MOUNTED `docs/`, which is copied in after Jekyll
   * and is not under the site directory the stripping works against. Every
   * `readOnly: true` kind therefore still lacks a path.
   *
   * So the assertion is written as the WEAKER true thing, with the stronger
   * one named. Asserting the correlation as though it were the design would
   * make the eventual fix look like a regression; deleting the check would
   * lose the fact. This is the honest middle: state what holds now, say what
   * has to change, and fail if the reason changes.
