/**
 * "No published viewer" and "a viewer nothing links" are different findings.
 *
 * `harness-tiles.ts` discovers a kind's viewer by CONVENTION — a page at
 * `/<handler>/<kind>/<name>/`, or `/<kind>/` for the instance that owns the
 * site. A viewer published anywhere else is real, on disk, and invisible to
 * that search.
 *
 * ## The false finding this exists to prevent
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-22. `who-iris/catalogue` gained a viewer at
 * `who-iris/docs/catalogue.html` — declared, resolving, gated. The tile
 * generator went on reporting *"declares N graph(s) with no published
 * viewer — catalogue, …"*, while the declared-ref check twenty lines further
 * down in the same file reported that same declaration as perfectly fine.
 *
 * Two halves of one generator disagreeing about one graph, with the artefact
 * asserting the false half. That is worse than a missing tile: a report that
 * claims a gap which has been filled teaches its reader to discount it, and
 * this repository's findings are only worth anything if they are believed.
 *
 * Splitting the finding immediately turned up a case that predates the change
 * — `uploads` declares a viewer at
 * `cat-harness/docs/cat-harness/library/who-iris/index.html` which exists and
 * which no tile links. So the defect was live before it was noticed, which is
 * the usual shape.
 *
 * ## What is NOT asserted here
 *
 * That the undiscovered viewer gets linked. It does not, deliberately: making
 * an instance-relative ref linkable means resolving it through `withRoutes`,
 * which changes how every tile resolves and belongs in its own change. These
 * assertions pin the HONESTY of the report, not the reach of the discovery.
 *
