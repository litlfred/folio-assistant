/**
 * The per-block QA badge summarises a sidecar into one of FOUR states.
 *
 * Three are obvious. The fourth — `unswept` — is the one worth testing,
 * because it is the difference between an icon that informs and one that
 * reassures. A block with no sidecar has not been checked; a block whose every
 * criterion came back `n/a` was checked and nothing applied. Rendering either
 * as "clean" is the false pass this repository keeps paying for: a sweep
 * reporting a healthy corpus it never looked at is indistinguishable
 * downstream from one that found nothing wrong.
 *
 * Measured when this landed, across every generated page: **1 fail, 13 pass,
 * 99 unswept**. The 99 are blocks on pages the sweep has never run over, and
 * they now say so rather than silently carrying no icon at all.
