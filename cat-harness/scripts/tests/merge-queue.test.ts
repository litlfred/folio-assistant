/**
 * The overlap PARTITION — four kinds of collision, and a train is the right
 * answer to exactly one of them.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/merge-queue
 *
 * Bean `hfag`. `merge:overlap` measured the gap on 2026-10-02 across all 36
 * open PRs (459 pairs): **#1907 × #1909 have `authored_overlap = 0` yet
 * `independent: false`**, because they collide only on generated regions and
 * on a shared declaration. A steward that reads those two cases alike builds
 * trains nobody needed.
 *
 * The property under test is not "it returns a string" — it is that **four
 * kinds stay four kinds**, and in particular that the two cheap kinds
 * (`generated-only`, `shared-declaration`) never render as the expensive one.
 * The order matters too, and it is tested rather than assumed: a PR holding
 * both an authored collision and a generated one is `authored`, because
 * regeneration cannot resolve the authored half.
