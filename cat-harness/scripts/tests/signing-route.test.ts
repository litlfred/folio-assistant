/**
 * The signing route — the branch is exhaustive, and everything it cannot name
 * goes to the human.
 *
 * Bean `folio-assistant-r0rq`. The route is a DMN table rather than code
 * because the policy is an editor's to change; these tests pin the two
 * properties that are NOT policy:
 *
 *  1. **the API row is unique** — reachable from exactly one combination of
 *     facts, and both facts are load-bearing;
 *  2. **every other combination routes to a person**, including `unknown` and
 *     including values not yet in the table.
 *
 * Property 2 is the one worth a test rather than a reading. A gateway that
 * sent "could not determine" to the API would fail closed on the wire and
 * OPEN IN THE RECORD: the call fails and what survives is an unsigned report
 * with nothing saying it is unsigned.
