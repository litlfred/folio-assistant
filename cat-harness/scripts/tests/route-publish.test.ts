/**
 * `publishRoute` on REAL git repositories: a bare remote over `file://` and a
 * checkout whose declaration sets `storage: { keyedBy: "route" }`.
 *
 * Same practice as `branch-mount.test.ts` — a rejected push and a real tip are
 * things a remote does, so a stub would only test the stub.
 *
 * Owner's choice, 2026-10-04, of three shapes put to them: a route-keyed branch
 * had NO writer, because `mountTip`/`pushMount` open the store with no
 * `keyedBy` and so default to `tip` — measured `corrupt` against the real
 * `cat/cat-harness/uml-overview`. Bean `xsrv`.
 *
 * **The load-bearing test is the WHOLESALE half.** `write` is a splice — "every
 * path not named is carried across untouched" — and a route's contract is that
 * its one generator replaces it wholesale. A `publish` that only writes would
 * serve a page the generator stopped emitting for ever, and it would render
 * perfectly while doing it, which is why no other check would catch it.
 *
