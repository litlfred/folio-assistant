 * The site root is composed from the instance stub, in ONE place.

 * `translation-index.ts`, `gen-docs-pages.ts`, `gen-skill-docs.ts`,
 * `gen-schema-docs.ts` and `translation-qa-sweep.ts` — five copies free to
 * disagree, and the bean counted them as the defect. Packaging the site under
 * `docs/<stub>/` for the repo split moved all five at once; nothing stopped a
 * sixth appearing the next day.
 *
 * This is the same shape as `graph-typology-docs.test.ts` (bean `5o3a`): a fact
 * that lives in code and in prose drifts unless something crosses between
 * them. Here both sides are code, which makes it cheaper, not less necessary.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/site-dir-single-answer
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (reads the aggregate
 * root's `.gitignore`) live in `test/site-dir-single-answer-checkout.test.ts`

/**
 * A literal naming the OUTPUT site root **in a path-resolving position**.

 * than to every quoted `docs/…` on purpose. Plenty of strings here name the
 * path as PROSE — a finding's `where:`, a console message, a QA criterion's
 * description — and those are documentation, not resolution: they do not
 * break when the directory moves, and failing on them would mean the guard
 * fires on its own rationale. The defect this bean measured was five
 * CONSTANTS that resolve to a directory, so that is what is checked.
 *
 * `content/docs/` is the generator's INPUT — a different directory that
 * happens to share a segment — so a preceding `content` disqualifies a hit.
 *
 * ## `scanSync` and a bare `cwd:` were added after they let one through
 *
 * `html-comment-delimiters.test.ts` globbed with `scanSync` and a bare `cwd`
 * set to the site-root literal — matching none of the named functions, so this
 * guard passed it. (Spelled around rather than quoted, because writing it out
 * makes this guard fire on its own rationale; the sibling test reassembles its
 * fixture from parts for the same reason.) The stub
 * inversion then broke it in the worst available way: the move left an empty
 * `docs/` holding only the gitignored bundler tree, so LOCALLY the glob
 * matched nothing and the test passed over zero files — while in CI
 * `bundle install` populates that tree and the test reported findings in
 * third-party gem HTML. Green locally, red in CI, and neither run was looking
 * at the site.
 *
 * The lesson is about the SHAPE of the list, not the one missing entry: a
 * function allow-list only covers the resolution idioms somebody thought of.
 * A bare `cwd:`/`dir:`/`root:` property is a path-resolving position whatever
 * consumes it, so those are matched directly.

/**
 * Source with its comments blanked, line numbering preserved.
 *
 * ## Why this is a function rather than two `.replace` calls
 *
 * It WAS two: `line.replace(/\/\/.*$/, "").replace(/\/\*.*?\*\//g, "")`,
 * applied per line. That handles `//` and a `/* … *` + `/` opened and closed on
 * one line, and **misses a `/** … *` + `/` block entirely** — every
 * continuation line of a JSDoc comment reached the scanner as code.
 *
 * So the guard failed on documentation that explained the guard. Measured
 * 2026-09-22: a test comment reading *"it was `join(REPO, "cat-harness",
 * "docs")`, and `site-dir-single-answer` refused it"* was reported as a
 * violation. That is precisely the case the original comment said stripping
 * existed to prevent — the intent was right and the implementation did not
 * reach it.
 *
 * Worth fixing rather than rewording the comment, because the next person to
 * document a path decision hits it too, and the obvious escape is to delete
 * the explanation instead of the literal.
 *
 * Blanking rather than deleting, so `${rel}:${i + 1}` still names the real
 * line. A dropped line would shift every number after it, and a guard that
 * reports the wrong line is worse than one that misses.
 *
 * NOT a full tokenizer: a `/*` inside a string literal blanks from there to
 * the next `*` + `/`. That direction is safe — it can only HIDE a violation,
 * never invent one — and a scanner elaborate enough to parse strings is a
 * scanner with its own bugs. The narrow miss is preferred to the broad one.
