/**
 * The stray-backtick gate, falsified in both directions.

 * @module scripts/tests/check-viewer-backticks
 * @graphNode none — a test
 *
 * The half that matters is the NEGATIVE one. A checker that answered "fine"
 * unconditionally would pass every real file in this repo, since every real
 * file is currently fine — so the real corpus alone proves nothing, and a
 * planted defect is the only evidence the gate works.
