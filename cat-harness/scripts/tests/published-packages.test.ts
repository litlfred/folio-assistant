/**
 * `publishablePackages()` discovers BOTH halves of what this repository ships.
 *
 * The gate it backs exists because `@litlfred/block-qa-schema` shipped to npm
 * for months with nothing building it (bean `rsi6`, PR #914 — ten green checks,
 * none of which read the file it changed). Closing that left the package's
 * SECOND half — `python/block_qa_schema/` and an 18-test pytest suite — still
 * reachable by nothing at all (bean `1s5s`).
 *
 * The discovery is the part worth testing, because every way it can be wrong
 * is a way the gate goes green over an unexamined package:
 *
 *   - miss a manifest → that package is never built, silently;
 *   - walk the filesystem instead of the index → thousands of third-party
 *     packages under `node_modules/` and `.venv/` are reported as this
 *     repository's own (the `ramz` rule);
 *   - collapse a directory's two halves into one entry → the npm half passing
 *     would vouch for the Python half, which is precisely the state `1s5s`
 *     names;
 *   - guess a test runner rather than read the package's declaration → a
 *     package that declares none gets a verdict nobody computed.
 *
 * Fixtures are real git repositories in a temp dir, because the function's
 * contract is "what git accounts for" and a mocked `git ls-files` would test
 * the mock. Each one is initialised, populated and `git add`ed; the untracked
 * case is deliberately NOT added, which is the only way to check the index is
 * doing the work rather than the filesystem.
