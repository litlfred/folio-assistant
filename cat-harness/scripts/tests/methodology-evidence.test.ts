/**
 * The methodology evidence axis, against THIS corpus rather than fixtures.
 *
 * Fixtures would prove the branches; this proves the claim that matters — that
 * the five real methodology nodes validate, and that the one with an ingested
 * source resolves to it. The measurement this axis exists for (six citations,
 * zero ingested sources) was only visible because the real corpus was read.
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (reads the methodology
 * graphs of the content instances, smart-base's among them) live in
 * `test/methodology-evidence-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it.
