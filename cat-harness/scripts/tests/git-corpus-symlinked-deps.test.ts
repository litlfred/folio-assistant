/**
 * A symlinked `node_modules` must not enter the corpus. Bean `qook`.
 *
 * ## The defect, measured 2026-09-26
 *
 * `check:merged` builds a throwaway worktree of the merged tree and SYMLINKS
 * the checkout's `node_modules` into it, to avoid a second install. `.gitignore`
 * line 1 read `node_modules/` — and git's trailing slash means **directory
 * only**. A symlink is not a directory, so in that worktree the path was not
 * ignored, `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` returned it, and
 * {@link gitCorpus} handed every consumer **one phantom entry**.
 *
 * What that cost, on the same commit `0d3c49c8`:
 *
 * | | corpus | `kg:detangle:check` |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | real checkout (`node_modules` a directory) | 13666 | ✓ 29 pinned current |
 * | worktree (`node_modules` a symlink) | 13667 | ✗ 5 STALE |
 *
 * The lists differed by exactly one entry, `node_modules`, and removing the
 * trailing slash took the corpus back to 13666 and the stale set from five
 * files to one. So `check:merged` reported a merged tree defective when no
 * real checkout of it was — twice in one hour, on two unrelated branches
 * (#1392 and #1395), which is how the bean was opened.
 *
 * ## Why the test is at the CORPUS level rather than on the pattern
 *
 * Asserting `.gitignore` contains a particular string pins the spelling, not
 * the behaviour, and git decides directory-ness from the filesystem rather
 * than from the text. So this builds the actual shape — a repository whose
 * `node_modules` is a symlink — and asks {@link gitCorpus} what it sees.
 * That is the question every consumer asks, and the one that was answered
 * wrongly.
 *
 * It is a scratch repository rather than this one on purpose: this repo's
 * `node_modules` is a real directory, so the defect is INVISIBLE here. A test
 * that could only run where the bug cannot occur is not a test.
