/**
 * The site mark's mask, and the one number that can silently disagree again.
 *
 * Bean `nwrm`. The defect being fixed was two colour vocabularies for one
 * instance: `cat-harness` declared tone **268** while its mark was sage
 * (~hue 100), because the mark's colours were baked into an SVG that no CSS
 * could reach. The mask form takes its colour from CSS — so the hue now lives
 * in `docs-ui.css` as a literal, and a literal is exactly what drifted before.
 *
 * These assert the join rather than the values: the stylesheet's hue must BE
 * the declared tone, and the two schemes must use the avatar generator's own
 * lightness targets rather than a third set invented here.
