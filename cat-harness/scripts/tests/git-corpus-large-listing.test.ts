/**
 * A listing larger than 1 MiB must still be answered, not reported as
 * "git could not answer".
 *
 * ## The defect, measured 2026-09-30
 *
 * `spawnSync` caps captured stdout at `maxBuffer`, which defaults to 1 MiB.
 * This checkout's `git ls-files -z --cached --others --exclude-standard`
 * reached 1,050,496 bytes, and past that limit the call returns ENOBUFS.
 * {@link gitCorpus} and bootstrap-tools' `gitFiles` both read any error as
 * "git could not answer" and returned `undefined`. So `iri:sync:check`
 * printed "git could not list the corpus" and failed on a clean tree, and
 * every other `gitCorpus` caller fell back quietly.
 *
 * The test builds a repository whose listing is larger than the old default,
 * so it still bites when this checkout is small again.
