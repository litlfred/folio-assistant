/**
 * A workflow reads this repository's name; it never spells it.
 *
 * Bean `kuxk`. `feature-staging.yml` wrote
 * `baseurl: "/folio-assistant/STAGING/<slug>"` into the Jekyll config, and
 * Jekyll builds every internal link from `baseurl` — so in any folio whose
 * repository is not named `folio-assistant`, every link on every staging page
 * pointed at a path that does not exist. The build succeeded, the deploy
 * succeeded, and it was wrong only in a browser.
 *
 * It was the **one** outlier in its own file: five other places in it compose
 * the same URL from `github.event.repository.name` or `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and
 * get it right. This is the genericity family `AGENTS.md` records — the `QOU.`
 * module prefix, `generate-readme.sh`, the `folio-assistant/simulators`
 * literal — each of which was found in `scripts/` or `content/pipeline/`.
 * **The workflows had never been swept.**
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT a finding
 *
 * Most `folio-assistant` strings under `.github/workflows/` are legitimate and
 * a checker that flagged them would be turned off within a week:
 *
 * - **Prose** — `::error::folio-assistant is the PLATFORM and carries no
 *   papers`. A message naming the platform is documentation.
 * - **The submodule directory** — `folio-assistant/computations`,
 *   `working-directory: folio-assistant`. A folio checks the platform out
 *   into a directory of that name; that is a convention about the DEPENDENCY,
 *   not this repository's own name, and it is correct as written.
 * - **Artefact stems** — `folio-assistant.jsonld`. Those come from the stub
 *   and are a separate question (`artefactStub`).
 *
 * So this checks the narrow thing that actually broke: a **Jekyll `baseurl`**
 * carrying a literal path segment instead of an expression. Narrow on purpose
 * — the value of a guard is that its findings are all real.
 *
