/**
 * A sweep runs on ACTIVE content, and the declaration says which that is.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-20: *"qa-sweep skips fsh-guts"*, and the general form in the
 * same breath — *"qasweep is only on active/working content, unless explicit
 * otherwise"*.
 *
 * ## It is the existing axis, not a new one
 *
 * `fsh-guts` declares `holds: "context"` — *"Read, never written by a
 * process"* — because what is in it is deprecated or superseded. So the rule
 * needs no directory name: `graphLayer` already answers it, and a graph
 * retired tomorrow is skipped the day it is declared.
 *
 * ## Why this is a guard and not a fix
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-20 before writing it: `walkBlocks` over `fsh-guts/` yields
 * **0** blocks, because the only `.ts` in there is a script rather than a
 * manifest. Nothing is wrong today. The rule exists for the day somebody
 * retires a real block into it — which is what the directory is FOR — at
 * which point a sweep would report findings about material nobody maintains,
 * and a reader could not tell those from live ones.
 *
