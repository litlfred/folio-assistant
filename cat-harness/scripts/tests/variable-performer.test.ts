/**
 * A lane may DECLARE that its performer varies, and the audit reads it.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/variable-performer.test
 *
 * Bean `ug4r`. `log-message.bpmn`'s `Actor` lane binds no role on purpose —
 * the actor is whoever called the sub-process — but until 2026-09-21 that
 * decision lived only in a prose `_comment` inside
 * `bootstrap/scenarios/roles.json`. No tool read it, so "deliberately
 * unbound" and "nobody got round to it" were the same fact to every consumer,
 * and `lane-binds-role` (severity `major`) would report a correct modelling
 * decision as a defect for ever.
 *
 * These assert the three things that has to be true for the flag to be worth
 * having: it PARSES, it SUPPRESSES the finding, and it does not suppress a
 * finding on an ordinary unbound lane — which is the failure mode that would
 * turn the fix into a way of hiding real defects.

/**
 * Where "no graph" is answered now — bean `7go7`, the owner's ruling
 * 2026-09-23.
 *
 * `laneBinding` cannot be asked without a graph, so each of its three
 * consumers has its own answer and they agree on the meaning:
 *
 *  - `kg-audit.ts` skips the lane loop and records `unknown` against
 *    `role-ref-resolves`, `lane-binds-role` and five more. It already did the
 *    recording; the loop's verdicts were computed and discarded.
 *  - `gen-processes-viz.ts` reports `binding: "ungraphed"`. It used to publish
 *    the discarded verdict, which is why it, not the audit, was the consumer
 *    disagreeing.
 *  - `glossary-export.ts` pushes ONE problem naming the missing registry
 *    instead of one per lane. That channel is fatal, so the old behaviour was
 *    a red gate built from false symptoms.
