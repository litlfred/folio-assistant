/**
 * `qa-reporting`'s first consumer, falsified.
 *
 * The gate's whole risk is collapsing three outcomes into two. Fold
 * `unresolved` into `permitted` and it is decorative; fold it into `forbidden`
 * and it fails on a corpus nobody has migrated. Both failures look like a
 * working gate from the outside, so each is pinned here.
