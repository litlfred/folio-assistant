/**
 * A relocated subject's QA sidecar MOVES with it — and refuses to move on
 * anything less than proof.
 *
 * Bean `lps0` asked for this; issue #760 walked into it. Moving `corpus-grep`
 * from `src/skills/` to `skills/folio-core/` stranded its verdict at the old
 * path, where the orphan sweep correctly reported it as auditing a file that
 * is not there — and the only way out was a human authorising a deletion.
 *
 * ## What this pins, and why the refusals matter more than the move
 *
 * The move itself is one `renameSync`. The reason this file exists is the
 * three conditions that stop it, each of which corresponds to a way a verdict
 * could be filed against a subject it never audited:
 *
 * - **Not on `undefined`.** `subjectExists` has three states and the third is
 *   "could not read the sidecar". A sidecar whose identity could not be read
 *   is exactly the one that must not be moved on a guess.
 * - **Identity, not basename.** Two packages can hold a same-named skill.
 *   Matching on the filename would move one package's verdict onto another's.
 * - **Not when ambiguous.** An orphan announces itself; a misfiled verdict
 *   reads as healthy. Ambiguity is left alone and reported.
 *
 * Asserted against a fixture rather than the corpus, because the corpus is
 * green and therefore proves none of it.
 *
