/**
 * A renderer that ignores the scheme check fails HERE rather than shipping.
 *
 * Bean `folio-assistant-q2wm`, R17. The bean's second done-when asks for
 * exactly this: *"a renderer that ignores the hint fails a test rather than
 * shipping"*.
 *
 * ## Why this is a SOURCE check and not only a behavioural one
 *
 * A behavioural test proves the paths it exercises. This one has to cover the
 * paths nobody thought to exercise — the next `href` somebody adds — so it
 * reads the source and requires every one of them to go through `safeHref`.
 *
 * It is a blunt instrument and that is deliberate: a new `href:` that is safe
 * by composition still has to say so, by going through the check or by
 * carrying an exemption with a reason. The alternative is a rule that lives in
 * a comment, which is the consumer-burden failure this issue already found
 * twice.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/href-safety.test
