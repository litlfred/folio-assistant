/**
 * A tile's count is the count of THE PAGE THAT TILE OPENS.
 *
 * Issue #863. #862 shipped two badges that broke this, and both looked fine:
 *
 * | tile | badge shipped | page it opens | actually shows |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | `schemas` | 137 modules | `.../schemas/cat-harness/` | 122 |
 * | `library` | 8 entries | `.../library/cat-harness/` | **0** |
 *
 * The `library` one is the worse of the two and the more instructive. That
 * directory's own declaration says *"THIS INSTANCE HOLDS NONE"* — bean `frs5`
 * moved all four entries out — so the tile advertised eight entries over an
 * empty page. It is exactly the empty-viewer case bean `v18c` observed and
 * that this whole feature was built to surface, and the first version of the
 * feature hid it behind a number.
 *
 * ## Why this is asserted as an invariant and not as a snapshot
 *
 * Pinning "library is 0" would go red the first time somebody ingests a
 * document into this instance, which is a corpus change and not a defect. So
 * the assertion is the SUM: every scoped tile counts a disjoint slice of one
 * graph, so their counts can never add up to more than the graph holds.
 *
 * A whole-graph number on a scoped tile breaks that the moment more than one
 * instance contributes — which is the defect's own shape, and is why this
 * fails on the code as it shipped rather than merely describing it. Equality
 * holds today because every contributing instance's page is declared; a page
 * nobody declares gets no tile and no count, so the sum falls BELOW the total
 * without anything being wrong. Hence `<=` rather than `===`.
