/**
 * `schemas/types.ts` defines the block discriminated union `Block` with 15
 * members. Five independent, hand-maintained lists enumerated those kinds, and
 * every one of them carried the same 13: `algorithm` and `table` were added to
 * the union and never propagated.
 *
 * The consequence was silent and large. `readBlockManifest` returns
 * `undefined` for an unrecognised builder, and `walkBlocks` skips whatever it
 * returns `undefined` for — so on the qou corpus 461 blocks (445 `table`, 16
 * `algorithm`) were never yielded to any QA tool. Never swept, never audited,
 * mostly without a sidecar at all. Roughly 13% of the corpus, excluded by a
 * stale regex rather than by a decision, and nothing reported a problem
 * because "not a block" and "a block with nothing wrong" are indistinguishable
 * downstream.
 *
 * `BLOCK_KINDS` is now the single runtime list, with a compile-time
 * exhaustiveness assertion against `Block["kind"]` in `schemas/types.ts` (that
 * one fails `tsc`, verified by deleting a member). These cover the consumers,
 * where the check has to be a runtime one: the viewer registry carries
 * per-kind metadata and types `kind` as `string`, so there are no literals for
 * the compiler to compare.
