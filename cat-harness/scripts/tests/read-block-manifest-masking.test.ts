/**
 * `readBlockManifest` decides what counts as a content block. Getting it wrong
 * in the permissive direction is worse than missing a block: an ordinary source
 * file becomes a "block", every per-block checker runs on it, and the results
 * are filed under a label that does not exist.
 *
 * That happened. `content/pipeline/witness-substitution-audit.ts` carries a
 * self-test containing the literal text of a manifest, and the raw scan yielded
 * that audit script as a block labelled `prop:x`.
