/**
 * The image-role gate's judgements, pinned.
 *
 * Bean `5yrl`. Six of these tests exist for the states that are NOT failures —
 * `by-id`, `declined`, and the permitted orphan — because those are where a
 * check of this shape goes wrong. A gate that only knows "fine" and "broken"
 * would have reported six false positives on this repository's own corpus (the
 * `landing-*` theme roles, consumed through a declared `imageRole` rather than
 * a lookup call) and would have failed `mark`, whose image is reached by id.
