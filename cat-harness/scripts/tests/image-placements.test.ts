/**
 * One entry per DISTINCT image, and the placements the collapse must not lose.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/image-placements.test
 * @graphNode none — a test
 *
 * Bean `j820`, issue #1234. Written because the migration that introduced
 * `placements[]` passed the whole 138-gate set UNTOUCHED — schema, generator,
 * 29 rewritten sidecars, 530 deleted PNGs, and not one red. A change that big
 * going green means nothing was looking, which is the `1xhc` shape. These are
 * the assertions that would have gone red.
 *
 * The corpus case at the end is the non-vacuous one: it reads the real
 * sidecars, so it fails if a future ingest re-introduces per-placement entries.
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (reads the image
 * sidecars of smart-base's library entries) live in
 * `test/image-placements-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it.
