/**
 * The onboarding path: intent triage, the repo scan, and the Pages report.
 *
 * What is worth testing here is not that the code runs — it is that the three
 * places where a wrong answer would be *confidently* wrong stay honest:
 *
 *   1. `folio-intent.dmn` returns `ask` on both ambiguous filesystem states,
 *      and never invents a branch. An agent cannot route past a question the
 *      table did not ask.
 *   2. `scan-repo-content` leaves what it cannot classify in a third bucket
 *      rather than filing it on a guess.
 *   3. `pages-bootstrap` distinguishes a measured 404 from a failed check.
 *
 * Each of those is a case where the tempting shortcut produces output that
 * looks exactly like a correct answer, which is why they get tests and the
 * formatting does not.
 *
 * (1) and (3) read `folio-intent.dmn` and `pages-live-gate.dmn`, which
 * folio-assistant-core owns, so those tests live beside them in
 * `folio-assistant-core/scripts/tests/getting-started.test.ts` (bean `ho66`).
 *
 * "this repo's own address is derived from the remote" is a check of THIS
 * repository's configuration — it expects `litlfred.github.io/folio-assistant`
 * — so it lives in the checkout's root test home, as
 * `test/getting-started-repo-root.test.ts` (owner, 2026-10-06: "Throwaway
 * repository, plus moving the real-repo checks"). The derivation itself is
 * asserted here over a throwaway repository whose `origin` is known.
