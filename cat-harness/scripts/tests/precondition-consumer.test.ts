/**
 * The pre-execution gate has a consumer, and this test goes red when it stops.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/precondition-consumer.test
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * `<bootstrap.processes:precondition>` (bean `lv3j`) was parsed, three-valued and tested
 * from the day it landed, and had **zero non-test callers** until #853
 * requirement 3. `precondition.test.ts` covers the evaluator; nothing covered
 * whether anything ASKED it. That is `a58y`'s defect exactly — a declaration
 * that reads as a control and enforces nothing — and a second evaluator test
 * would not have caught it, because the evaluator was never the broken part.
 *
 * So this test drives the **registered `workflow_start` handler**, through the
 * same `server.tool` call the real server makes. Delete the `preflight` call
 * from `cat-harness/src/tools/workflow.ts` and the refusal case below fails.
 * That is the property the Done-when asked for, and it is why this could not
 * be written against `preflight()` directly: a unit test of the gate stays
 * green in exactly the world the gate is not consulted.
 *
 * ## Falsified before it was trusted
 *
 * | break | result |
 * |---|---|
 * | `preflight` call removed from `workflow_start` | refusal test **fails** |
 * | `preflightRefusal` returns `undefined` always | refusal test **fails** |
 * | `could-not-determine` folded into `unsatisfied` | `starts anyway` test **fails** |
 * | restored | all pass |
