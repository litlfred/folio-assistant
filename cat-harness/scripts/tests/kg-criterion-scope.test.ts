/**
 * A criterion declares WHOSE corpus can answer it, and an instance run says when
 * it withheld one.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `kg:audit` ran only from `cat-harness/` until 2026-09-26 (bean `bjzs`). Pointing
 * it at another declared instance is one assignment — everything derives from a
 * single `root` — and the first run of it reported **76 criticals of which 73 were
 * false**: 36 repository-level actors judged against bootstrap's 4 roles, because
 * `ACTOR_DIR` resolves through `repoRootFor` and so does not follow `--instance`.
 *
 * The owner chose classifying **all 68** criteria over declaring only the one
 * measured to misfire. The risk they accepted, and the reason these tests are
 * shaped the way they are, is that a wrong `repo` SUPPRESSES a real finding and a
 * suppression reads as a clean `n/a` forever.
 *
 * ## So the assertions are about the pair, not the list
 *
 * A test that hardcoded which five are `repo` would pass over a wrong fifth and
 * go stale the day a sixth is right — the count-in-a-test failure this repository
 * has paid for twice. What is asserted instead: every criterion has decided,
 * every `repo` carries its evidence, and the suppression is VISIBLE in the
 * artefact. The one empirical claim — that the 73 are gone — is asserted by
 * spawning the auditor, because only a run can say that.
 *

   * as a side effect. Spawning is the only way to observe it. (Guarding that
   * module is a worthwhile separate change and is NOT done here.)
   *
   * ## Why `--check`, and why the exit code is not the assertion
   *
   * The first version of this test spawned the WRITING form and deleted
   * `bootstrap/test/` afterwards. That was a defect: `bun test` runs files in
   * parallel, so for the length of the run `bootstrap/` transiently held sidecars
   * whose `where` fields name paths above it — and
   * `graph.test.ts > only the listed structural names remain` (bean `iwtn`) reads
   * exactly that. It passed alone and failed in the suite, which is the `ymsu`
   * shape: a test that writes what another test reads.
   *
   * `--check` writes nothing and prints the same summary, so the interference is
   * removed rather than cleaned up after. Its exit code is **1** here, correctly:
   * bootstrap's sidecars are deliberately not committed (their directory is not
   * declared), so "stale or missing" is the honest verdict. The assertions are
   * therefore about the REPORT, plus one that it wrote nothing.
