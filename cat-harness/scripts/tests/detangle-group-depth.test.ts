/**
 * `groupDepthFor` — the derivation that replaced `SCAN`'s hardcoded depths.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/tests/detangle-group-depth.test
 *
 * The table it replaces had no test, and could not usefully have had one: a
 * literal agrees with itself. What is testable is a RULE, and the rule's whole
 * claim is that it reproduces every depth the table asserted while continuing to
 * work on directories the table never named — which is what makes
 * *"sub-dir = named subgraph declared by harness"* true mechanically.
 *
 * It imports from `group-depth.ts`, NOT from `kg-detangle.ts` where the rule is
 * used, and the last `describe` here is what keeps it that way. `kg-detangle.ts`
 * is an unguarded script: importing it runs the tool and writes the 29 sidecars
 * `kg:detangle:check` reads. This file's first version did exactly that, and
 * `bun test` said so — *"wrote 29 pinned measurement(s)"* above *"10 pass"* —
 * which is `ymsu`: a test that writes what a later gate reads makes the gate
 * green over any tree at all.
