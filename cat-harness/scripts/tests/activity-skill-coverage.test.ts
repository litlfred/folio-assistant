/**
 * Every activity in the corpus either names a skill or says why it has none.
 *
 * ## Why this is a test and not a CI flag
 *
 * `activity-names-skill` is `major`, which gates `bun run kg:audit:strict`.
 * CI runs `kg:audit:check`, which gates on `critical` only — so the severity
 * alone enforces nothing here.
 *
 * Switching CI to `:strict` would work and is the tempting one-line answer. It
 * also promotes EVERY `major` criterion to gating in the same stroke —
 * `lane-binds-role`, `role-carries-activity-skill`, `skill-servable`,
 * `call-activity-resolves` — which is a much larger commitment than the change
 * that motivated it, and would turn a sibling branch red for something its
 * author never touched. This asserts exactly the property that was just
 * established and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Why the property is assertable at all now
 *
 * It was not, until this commit. The criterion had legitimate instances it
 * could not distinguish from defects: a stakeholder's sign-off, a corpus being
 * written into, and a skill nobody has written all read as "names no skill".
 * Gating on that would have forced a fake `<folio:skill ref>` onto a real step,
 * which is worse than the gap — so it stayed advisory, and 42 findings sat
 * there being explained in prose by each pass that met them.
 *
 * Three declarations changed that, and each is READ rather than inferred:
 *
 *   - a lane whose role is `actedUpon`   — written to, never acts
 *   - a lane whose role is `judgementOnly` — acts, but no procedure decides it
 *   - `<folio:no-skill reason="…"/>`      — this step, and why it has none
 *
 * The reason on the third is required at LOAD time: a diagram carrying a
 * reasonless exemption does not parse, so the whole file records `unknown`
 * rather than quietly passing. That is what stops the exemption being the
 * cheap way out — silencing the criterion costs more than satisfying it.
 *
 * ## Read a failure here as a question, not as a chore
 *
 * The fix is one of two things and they are not interchangeable: name the
 * skill that implements the step, or declare that none could and say why.
 * Reaching for the exemption because no skill comes to mind is how the second
 * becomes a rubber stamp. If the step has a performer who could be handed
 * instructions, it wants a skill.
