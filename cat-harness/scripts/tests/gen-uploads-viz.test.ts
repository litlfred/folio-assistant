/**
 * The uploads harness is the QUEUE's, and stays the queue's.
 *
 * Issue #836, bean `v18c`. `uploads` and `library` declared the same
 * `coverage.visualiser`, so the uploads tile opened the corpus browser and
 * rendered the library's entry count — 0 on this instance, while 27 sources
 * waited in the queue beside it. The owner rejected all three ways of dividing
 * one page: *"funcionally different/behavior diffent so need distinct
 * harness"*.
 *
 * So the assertions here are about the SEPARATION, not about columns. A test
 * that checked the table's headings would pass just as happily on the day
 * somebody folded the corpus back in.
