/**
 * `qrlc` — the git-helper roster is DERIVED, not listed.
 *
 * This census has now had the same defect twice: a scanner that was fixed fell
 * out of the population instead of moving to its good side, so the headline
 * got worse as the corpus improved.
 *
 *   1. The first time, `ENUMERATES` matched only bare walks, and a conversion
 *      removes the `readdirSync` it keyed on. Fixed by admitting the git
 *      spellings — as a HARDCODED list.
 *   2. The second time, that list went stale the hour it was written:
 *      `gitTopLevelDirs` was added, three scanners were converted to call it,
 *      and the census read 66/10 before and **65/10** after. The three had
 *      left the denominator and the git-aware count had not moved.
 *
 * Both are one class — a roster kept by hand beside the thing it tracks — and
 * it is the same class as the dead `SKILLS_CATEGORIES` key and the stale
 * `coverage.visualiser` refs. The repair is to stop keeping the roster.
