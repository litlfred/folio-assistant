/**
 * The archive guard, exercised against REAL `tar` output.
 *
 * Bean `6bhf`, the tar box. `/api/import/arxiv` fetches an archive from
 * `arxiv.org/e-print/` and extracts it, so its member names are not ours.
 *
 * ## Why this test builds actual tarballs
 *
 * The parsing here is the kind that looks right and is not. The first version
 * of the member-name extraction stripped **six** whitespace-separated fields
 * from a `tar tvzf` line; real GNU tar emits **five** before the name:
 *
 *     -rw-r--r-- root/root  2 2026-09-26 12:13 sub/a b c.tex
 *      \_______/ \_______/ \/ \________/ \___/ \___________/
 *        mode      owner   sz    date    time       name
 *
 * So `sub/a b c.tex` came out as `b c.tex`, and the containment check then ran
 * on a path that was never in the archive — a guard reading clean while
 * examining a fabrication. Asserting the source text could not have caught
 * that; only running `tar` could, which is why this file shells out.
 *
 * The extraction logic itself lives inline in the server's `fetch`, so the
 * predicates are restated here as the functions under test. That duplication is
 * deliberate and is the weakness of this file: it pins the RULES against real
 * tar, while `server-path-sinks.test.ts` pins that the server still applies
 * them. Neither alone is enough.
