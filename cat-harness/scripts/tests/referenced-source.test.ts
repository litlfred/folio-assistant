/**
 * A source RECORDED, not held — bean `scfh`, issue #1614.
 *
 * The OMG BPMN and DMN licences forbid posting copies on a network, so their
 * library entries identify the exact PDF and its outline and hold no text. The
 * assertion that matters most is the refusal: an entry of this kind that DOES
 * carry section text is refused, because that is the copy the kind exists not
 * to make.
 *
 * This file tests the TypeScript half — the schema, the manifest
 * `gen-library-jsonld` writes, and the L1 gate — against a hand-written record,
 * so it needs no PDF and no PyMuPDF. The writer, which does need PyMuPDF, is
 * tested in `referenced-source.test.py`, in the job that installs it. They were
 * one file until CI's TypeScript job, which installs no Python packages, failed
 * on the PDF fixture (#1615).
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/referenced-source
