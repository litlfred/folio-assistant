/**
 * The one orphan-page selector, and the two rules the unification carried.
 *
 * Bean `s8nu`. `orphanSubjectPages` and `prunableDashboards` were two correct
 * implementations of one question, and each held a rule the other lacked —
 * which is the argument for merging them rather than merely the tidiness of
 * one fewer function. Both rules are asserted here, because a merge that
 * quietly dropped either would still pass every test the two had before.
 *
 * The callers' own suites (`viewer-orphans.test.ts`, `state-visualizer.test.ts`)
 * are unchanged and remain the falsification the bean asked be kept: with the
 * ownership test replaced by "select on the directory", 5 of them fail.
