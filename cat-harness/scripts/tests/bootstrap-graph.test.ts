 * `export-graph.ts`, and `gen-bootstrap-graph.ts`, the cat-harness generator
 * these tests were first written against, is gone (owner: "remove
 * gen-bootstrap-graph"). The exporter's own properties — purity, ordering, no
 * absolute path, provenance only when asked, the `omitted` list — are asserted
 * beside it in `bootstrap-tools/scripts/export-graph.test.ts`. What stays here
 * is what only this repository can see: which workflow step publishes it,
 * where, and whether the export agrees with a disk read made independently of
 * the declaration.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/bootstrap-graph.test
 *
 * The tests here that read the aggregate repository's own root
 * (`.github/workflows/docs-site.yml` and the checkout's git index) live in
 * `cat-harness-tools/scripts/tests/bootstrap-graph-repo-root.test.ts` (bean
 * `ho66`): standing alone, cat-harness has no such root to read.
