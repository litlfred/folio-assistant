/**
 * A step runs when its inputs changed, when something it needs re-ran, or
 * when nothing can be concluded. Never otherwise, and never silently.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/render-selection.test
 *
 * Bean `9c34`. The failure this guards is one-directional and quiet: **a page
 * that was not re-rendered looks exactly like a page that was.** So the cases
 * that matter most here are the ones where the answer is "run anyway" —
 * a missing manifest, a step the manifest never mentions, a step that never
 * declared what it reads. Each of those is a *could not determine*, and this
 * repository's rule is that could-not-determine is never rendered as clean.
