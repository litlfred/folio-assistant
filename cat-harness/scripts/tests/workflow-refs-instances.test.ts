/**
 * `check:workflow-refs` audits bootstrap, and for a year it audited a typo.
 *
 * ## What happened
 *
 * `bootstrap` was added to that checker's instance list on 2026-09-19 with a
 * stated reason: *"a dangling `<…:skill ref>` in a diagram this checker never
 * opens is a broken reference reported as clean."* It was written as
 * `join(INSTANCE_ROOT, "bootstrap")` — and `INSTANCE_ROOT` is `cat-harness/`
 * while `bootstrap/` sits at the REPOSITORY root. So the path resolved to a
 * directory that has never existed, `workflowFiles` returned `[]`, and the
 * summary line printed *"2 instances"* beside the root's own diagram count.
 *
 * The change that fixed it is one expression. **What these tests pin is the
 * reason nobody noticed**: a checker looping over an empty set reports clean,
 * so the set being non-empty has to be asserted rather than assumed. That is
 * bean `dh4f` arriving inside the gate whose own docblock argues against
 * exactly this.
 *
 * ## Why this goes through the library
 *
 * `check-workflow-refs.ts` runs at module scope, so importing it would EXECUTE
 * it — the unguarded-entry-point defect `declared-directory-resolves.test.ts`
 * guards. So the property is asserted against `workflowFiles`, which is what
 * the checker calls, and the end-to-end behaviour is asserted by spawning the
 * script rather than importing it.
 *
