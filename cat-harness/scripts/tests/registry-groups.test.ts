/**
 * Every class the graph exporter can MINT is one the vocabulary DEFINES.
 *
 * Bean `3190`. `kg-export` projects `folio:<Class>` onto every node it finds
 * under `.claude/skills/<group>/`, taking the class name from
 * `REGISTRY_GROUPS`. `ns-export` writes the vocabulary those classes must
 * resolve in. Nothing joined the two, so `Convention` shipped as the `@type`
 * of two real nodes with no definition behind it — a link-shaped value that
 * does not dereference, bean `blv9`.
 *
 * `ns:check` reported **0 undefined** throughout, because it scanned for
 * `termIri("Name")` literals and a class minted from this table is not a
 * literal anywhere. `Requirement` had been in the same state for longer.
 *
 * So the join is tested here as well as performed in `ns-export`: the check
 * proves the CURRENT corpus is sound, and this proves the check still looks
 * at the right set — the failure mode that produced the gap was a check
 * passing over ground it never covered.
 *
