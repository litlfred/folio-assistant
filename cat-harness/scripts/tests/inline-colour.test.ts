/**
 * A colour written into an inline style fails HERE rather than shipping.
 *
 * Bean `folio-assistant-rptk`. The bean was filed against
 * `mountPageLanguageBar()`, that function was fixed, and its sibling
 * `buildLanguageBar()` kept the identical literals and the identical two
 * failing pairs — an unavailable tab at `opacity:0.5` compositing to 1.39:1
 * and a current tab at 3.67:1 — for two days afterwards. Nothing failed,
 * because nothing looks for a literal; the only thing that could have caught
 * it was an axe run over a tile view the gate did not open.
 *
 * ## Why a SOURCE check, when `test/a11y.e2e.ts` measures the real pixels
 *
 * axe measures what is on the screen. That is strictly better evidence and
 * strictly worse coverage: it proves the states somebody remembered to put
 * there, and this defect lived in the one state nobody clicked into. This
 * check is the complement — it proves nothing about contrast and everything
 * about WHERE A COLOUR MAY BE WRITTEN, over the whole file at once, including
 * the branches no fixture reaches.
 *
 * Together they say the thing neither says alone: every colour in the client
 * is a token in `docs-ui.css`, every token carries its measured ratio beside
 * it, and the rendered result is measured by axe in both schemes.
 *
 * ## `opacity` is called out by name, and it is not a style preference
 *
 * `skills/folio-core/ui-accessibility.md` names it, and this bean paid for it
 * twice. `opacity` on text composites the glyph toward whatever is behind it,
 * so the colour that reaches the reader is not the colour in the source —
 * `#475569` at `0.5` is `#323f52` on one panel and `#373e4a` on another. A
 * dimmer tab is its own token with its own number. Dimming a whole BOX (an
 * icon, a disabled control's entire subtree) is a different gesture and is
 * only a problem when text is inside it, so this check reads inline styles
 * rather than the stylesheet, where the intent is declared and reviewable.
