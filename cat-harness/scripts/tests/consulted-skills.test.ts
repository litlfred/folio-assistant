/**
 * `consulted: true` — the axis that says a skill is READ, not performed.
 *
 * ## What these guard
 *
 * The field exempts a skill from `kg-audit`'s `skill-in-role-or-process`,
 * and an exemption nobody can falsify is worse than the over-reporting it
 * replaces. So the assertions here are about the axis being REAL in both
 * directions: annotated where it should be, absent where it should not, and
 * spelled one way.
 *
 * The bidirectional guard itself — a consulted skill that a lane claims —
 * lives in the audit as `consulted-skill-not-performed`, because it is a
 * finding about the corpus rather than a property of this reader.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/consulted-skills.test
