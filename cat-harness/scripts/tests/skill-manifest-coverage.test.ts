/**
 * Every skill `.md` in a package is listed in that package's manifest.
 *
 * Found 2026-09-18. `skills/folio-core/` held 58 skill files and its
 * `package-manifest.json` listed 49. The nine unlisted ones — among them
 * `directory-conventions`, `process-state` and `swarm-management`, all added
 * days earlier — were on disk and reachable by anyone who already knew the
 * path, and invisible to everyone else.
 *
 * That is the failure mode worth naming, because it does not look like one.
 * `scripts/generate-registry.ts` builds the skill registry from
 * `loadPackageManifests()`, so the manifest is what an agent asking the
 * knowledge graph for a skill actually sees. A file omitted from it is not
 * broken, not red, and not missing — it is simply never offered. The author
 * who added it can still open it, which is exactly why nobody notices.
 *
 * Nothing checked the two against each other before this test: the manifest is
 * hand-maintained and adding a skill is two steps, of which only the first has
 * any feedback.
 *
 * Direction matters, and the two directions are not in the same state.
 *
 * A file with no manifest entry is unreachable; that check is hard.
 *
 * A manifest entry with no skill behind it is a dangling reference the registry
 * will publish. **19 when this test was written, then 8, now 0**, and the two
 * steps down had different causes worth keeping apart.
 *
 * Bean `x180` wrote the eleven missing instruction bodies. Bean `nup0` resolved
 * the remaining eight — and found that the check itself had been asking the
 * wrong question. *
 * **"A skill exists" was two different questions.** This file asked whether
 * `<package>/<name>.md` was present. `scripts/known-skills.ts` — extracted
 * precisely so checkers could not disagree about this — also counts
 * `schemas/skills/<name>/`, a directory of input/output JSON schemas with no
 * instruction body. Eleven of the nineteen "dangling" entries were skills that
 * exist by the shared definition and not by this file's narrower one, and
 * `docs/skills.md` documents them as deliberate: those packages "ship the
 * manifest + JSON definitions" with bodies TBD.
 *
 * So this now uses `knownSkills()`. Two definitions of existence in one
 * repository is the defect; the checker that disagreed with the shared one was
 * this file.
 *
 * What remained were eight entries, all FIXED rather than pinned: four were a
 * completed rename whose manifest never moved, one claimed another package's
 * skill, and three named skills that `git log --diff-filter=A` shows were never
 * added in any commit.
 *
 * ## One reading was overturned, and the evidence is worth recording
 *
 * The 8-entry version of this list called `authoring-document` a deliberate
 * **bundle manifest** — a package that legitimately lists skills held
 * elsewhere — and treated resolving it as a modelling question.
 *
 * It is not a pattern this repository has. Measured across all six packages:
 * every other one lists **exactly** what it holds, `folio-document-adapter`
 * held the four bodies with **no manifest of its own**, and both
 * `known-skills.ts` and `gen-skill-docs.ts` list `folio-document-adapter` as a
 * live package while neither mentions `authoring-document`. "Bundle manifest"
 * appears nowhere in the codebase outside that note.
 *
 * So it was a rename whose manifest never moved, and consolidating it makes the
 * corpus uniform: after `nup0`, **no package claims a skill it does not hold**.
 * If bundling is wanted as a real concept, it needs a field that says so rather
 * than an empty directory that looks like one.
 *
 * ## The other half of that reading, added 2026-09-19
 *
 * The three entries this file's `knownSkills()` switch surfaced —
 * `scientific-visualization`, `hypothesis-generation`,
 * `scientific-critical-thinking` — ARE declared, by
 * `skills/remote-packages/claude-scientific-skills.json`, and `kg-audit.ts`
 * accepted that as resolution. So for two hours the two checkers disagreed:
 * this one said delete, the audit said keep, and the corpus followed whichever
 * ran last.
 *
 * Measured, and this file was right: nothing in the repository syncs or serves a
 * remote package — `shallow-clone` is a Zod enum value, neither
 * `src/tools/skill-fetch.ts` nor `scripts/generate-registry.ts` reads that
 * directory, and the one real consumer reads it for Docker requirements. The
 * audit's allowance has been closed, so the two now agree by construction.
 * `scripts/tests/manifest-remote-resolution.test.ts` holds that argument and the
 * evidence it rests on.
