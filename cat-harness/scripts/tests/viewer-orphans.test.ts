/**
 * A viewer page that answers to no declaration is pruned; anything else is not.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/viewer-orphans.test
 *
 * **Bean `ankg`, found live.** #604 renamed `folio-assist-sci/` to
 * `folio-assistant-sci/`. The subject slug comes from the entry's path, so
 * regeneration produced the new page correctly and left the old one behind —
 * a page serving a subject the declaration no longer describes, at a URL
 * nothing links to, removed by hand in #603.
 *
 * `--check` was structurally blind to it: it compares only the files it is
 * about to write, so a file the generator no longer writes is outside what it
 * looks at. It can find a page that is WRONG; it could never find a page that
 * SHOULD NOT EXIST.
 *
 * These assert the pair the bean asks for — a planted orphan is found, a
 * hand-authored sibling survives — and they assert it against the COMMITTED
 * tree as well as against temp dirs, because that is what made the same fix in
 * `gen-iris-pages` catch a real orphan rather than a hypothetical one.
