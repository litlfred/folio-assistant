/**
 * One instance's graph does not carry another instance's nodes.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/instance-graph-isolation.test
 *
 * The defect these guard was LIVE on `main` on 2026-09-19, not hypothetical:
 * `findBpmnDirs` walked the filesystem, so `bootstrap/workflows/bootstrap.bpmn`
 * was discovered from the repository root as well as from bootstrap, and
 * `_kg/folio-assistant.jsonld` carried **88** references to `Process_InitializeHarness`.
 * CatBootstrap's process was published as part of folio-assistant's graph.
