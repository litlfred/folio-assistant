/**
 * `staging-preview` — the node type's own behaviour.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/staging-preview.test
 *
 * Two groups, and the second is the point. The first exercises creation,
 * enrichment and retirement. The second PINS the two measured facts about the
 * trashcan that forced this module's shape — a flat front-matter parser and a
 * key-stripping base schema — so that if either is ever fixed, a test says so
 * out loud rather than leaving a workaround in place that nobody can date.
