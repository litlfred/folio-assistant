/**
 * Which merge a red `main` is attributable to — and, above all, when it cannot
 * be told.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/ci-health-blame.test
 *
 * Bean `kgho`, implementing bean `391j`'s rule: **check the parent before
 * blaming the last merge.** `391j` blamed #1245's merge when `main` had already
 * been red one merge earlier at `08fe2c68` — a confident diagnosis, citing a
 * real commit, and wrong.
 *
 * The test that matters most here is the `none` one. A commit with no run of a
 * workflow is not a commit that passed it, and the cheap implementation — treat
 * anything that is not `failure` as green — produces a named suspect from an
 * absence. That is a false accusation in a tracking issue somebody then acts on.
