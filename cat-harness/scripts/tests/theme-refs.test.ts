/**
 * Every theme a declaration references is installed (#1168 B8).
 *
 * Theme references became `ThemeRef` objects `{instance?, themeId}` on
 * 2026-09-30 (owner: "migrate to ThemeRef"). The schema checks the shape;
 * this checks the reference RESOLVES. Before it, an unknown theme fell back
 * silently to the default at render time — a declaration that reads as a
 * choice and renders as none.
 *
 * Resolved BY REFERENCE, owner first (`themeByRef`, bean `v8n5`), not against
 * the platform table alone: who-iris's card cites its own `iris-sticky`,
 * which the platform deliberately does not hold, and a platform-only lookup
 * would call that correct reference broken.
