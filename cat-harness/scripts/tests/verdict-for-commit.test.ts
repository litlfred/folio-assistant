/**
 * `verdictForCommit` — was the check set COMPLETE, not just clean?
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/verdict-for-commit
 *
 * Issue #1646, bean `6lre`. `ci:watch` reported `PASS — 1 check(s) completed
 * clean`, exit 0, twice on 2026-09-30, against `total_count: 1`, while thirteen
 * checks ran on neighbouring commits of the same branch. The second time the
 * owner had authorised merging on a verified green, so the tool would have
 * merged an unverified tree.
 *
 * ## Why these fixtures are synthetic, and why the LIVE reproduction could not be
 *
 * The two real heads (`29b10a68923`, `0d714756f3d`) **cannot be replayed**. Both
 * were PR heads when they failed; the PR has merged, so `mergeStateForHead` now
 * answers `not-a-pr-head`, the owed event becomes `push`, and the one
 * push-triggered workflow did run. Re-running the fixed tool against them
 * correctly reports `pass`. Measured 2026-09-30 18:45 — so the historical shape
 * is gone and only a fresh push can produce it live.
 *
 * That is why the precedence is pinned here rather than only demonstrated: a
 * live check that can only be performed in a ten-second window after a push is
 * not a regression test.
 *
 * ## What must not drift
 *
 * The four states stay four, and a would-be `pass` is the ONLY one re-examined.
 * Re-deciding `fail` would let a completeness question soften a real failure —
 * the collapse #1624 was written to stop, arriving from the other direction.
