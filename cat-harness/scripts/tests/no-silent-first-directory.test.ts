/**
 * No call site takes the FIRST directory of a graph without saying it expects
 * one — and saying it means an accessor that refuses, not an index.
 *
 * ## The history this guards
 *
 * `directoryForGraph` returned the first declaration silently and was excised
 * on 2026-09-20 after costing three bugs in a day. `directoriesForGraph`'s doc
 * comment then settled where the singular assumption belongs, and that
 * decision stands:
 *
 * > *A caller that genuinely wants one writes `directoriesForGraph(...)[0]`,
 * > so the assumption is visible where it is made and greppable across the
 * > repo.*
 *
 * Visible, yes. **Checked, no.** `[0]` states "I expect one home" and then
 * quietly takes the first when there are four — and `schemas` HAD four, with
 * four call sites indexing it, for as long as nobody looked. Bean `a02m`.
 *
 * ## Why a test and not a review habit
 *
 * The last fix of this shape was `schema-nodes.ts`, one site, and it left
 * thirty-one. A defect that is fixed one occurrence at a time is a defect that
 * comes back, because the fix is knowledge in one person's head at one moment.
 * `directoryForGraph` and `instanceDirectoryForGraph` make the assumption
 * enforceable; this makes it enforced.
