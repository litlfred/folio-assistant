/**
 * The topology axes, and the five combinations a declaration may not name.
 *
 * Bean `folio-assistant-g7vb`, issue #363. Its first two criteria were met by
 * `cat-harness/docs/proposals/deployment-topologies.md` §3–§4: the scenarios are all
 * expressible as points in the axis product, and the incompatible pairs are
 * listed with their reasons. The third was not, and it is the one that needs
 * code: *"a declaration naming an incompatible pair is refused, not silently
 * accepted."*
 *
 * A constraint nobody enforces is a comment. These are the tests that make
 * the five rows of §3 into a refusal — and, more importantly, the tests that
 * make sure the refusal cannot reach a deployment that is working.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/topology-conflicts.test
