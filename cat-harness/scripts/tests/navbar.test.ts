/**
 * The shared navbar — its three regions, and the rail as an adapter over it.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-21: *"we should have same navbar across all folios though.
 * presented same way. need to comine the two."*
 *
 * This replaces `harness-rail.test.ts`, which tested a rail that owned its own
 * markup. It does not any more: `lib/navbar.ts` renders, `harness-rail.ts`
 * builds a model, and `mount-instance-docs.ts` injects. **The assertions that
 * matter moved with the code** — they are now about the REGIONS, because the
 * regions are what the owner specified and what a second caller (the Jekyll
 * sidebar, after #791 lands) has to be able to satisfy.
