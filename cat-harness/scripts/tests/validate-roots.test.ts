/**
 * The content validator had never validated anything, and the two defects
 * concealed each other.
 *
 * Its default target was `join(import.meta.dir, "../objects")` — an
 * import-relative path. A folio embeds folio-assistant as a symlinked
 * subdirectory, so `import.meta.dir` resolves into the PLATFORM tree and the
 * default pointed at `<folio-assistant>/content/objects`, which does not
 * exist. Finding no manifests there was recorded as a `warning` returning
 * `valid: true`, so the CLI printed "✓ Valid — 1 issue(s)" and exited 0.
 *
 * That early return was also the only reason the process survived: Phase 2
 * builds its `ConstraintContext` with `dir`, a name that does not exist in
 * that scope — the parameter is `objectsDir`. Any run reaching a single block
 * threw `ReferenceError: dir is not defined`. It could not be reached, because
 * the empty-corpus path returned first.
 *
 * Neither was visible to `tsc`: `content/**` is outside the tsconfig program
 * (bean `folio-assistant-tsca`).
 *
 * These pin the invariant that survives both: validating nothing is a
 * FAILURE, and a real corpus reaches Phase 2 without throwing.
