/**
 * A claim reaches the default branch, or says why it did not.
 *
 * Bean `35nj`. Every case is built against a REAL bare remote with a real
 * default branch, because the states that matter are the refusals and none of
 * them can be faked by stubbing git: a protected branch rejects at the receive
 * stage, and a non-fast-forward is a genuine ref race.
 *
 * **The refusals are the point, not the happy path.** This environment cannot
 * find out whether the default branch is protected — `GET /branches/main/
 * protection` answers 403 "Resource not accessible by integration", and
 * `git push --dry-run` does not run receive hooks — so the mechanism is built to
 * attempt and handle rejection rather than to assume. If `fell-back` regressed
 * into a silent no-op, a session would believe it had claimed something it had
 * not, which is worse than the duplicate `35nj` exists to prevent.
