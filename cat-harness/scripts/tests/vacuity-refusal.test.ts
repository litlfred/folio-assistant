/**
 * Bean `iym1` — a gate that examined nothing refuses, and the refusal is
 * actionable.
 *
 * ## The control that motivated this file is not in it
 *
 * Recorded because it is evidence and a fixture cannot produce it: run
 * `check:skills` against the real repository with `cat-harness/skills/` and
 * `.claude/skills/` moved aside, and before this change it printed
 *
 *     Validated: 0, Errors: 0
 *
 * and exited **0** — while declaring `@covers skills`, so `audit:coverage`
 * credited the `skills` kind to a gate that could not fail vacuously. After the
 * change the same control exits 2 and names all five sources.
 *
 * That control is deliberately NOT automated. Moving directories during
 * `bun test` repairs the tree other gates are being judged on, which is bean
 * `ymsu` — this defect's own shape one layer up. So the decision is a pure
 * function and the fixtures below construct the empty corpus instead.
