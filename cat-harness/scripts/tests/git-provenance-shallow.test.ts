/**
 * A shallow checkout must not be allowed to invent file provenance.
 *
 * `gitFileCommitSha` backs `script_commit_sha` in every QA script sidecar.
 * In a truncated history `git log -1 -- <file>` reports the GRAFT BOUNDARY
 * for any file untouched inside the fetched window — the commit where
 * history stops and every file looks newly added — and that is
 * indistinguishable from a real answer.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-18 in a 102-commit shallow checkout: a sweep rewrote 77
 * of 78 sidecars to the single boundary sha, collapsing provenance that
 * carried NINE distinct commits. The corruption is silent and reads as a
 * tidy-up.
 *
 * THESE TESTS BUILD THEIR OWN REPOSITORIES. The first version read the
 * ambient checkout, which passed locally (102 commits, some files committed
 * inside the window) and failed in CI, where `actions/checkout` fetches
 * depth 1 — there EVERY file resolves to the single commit, so no fixture
 * satisfying "committed inside the window" exists at all. A test of
 * shallow-clone behaviour must not itself depend on how deep the ambient
 * clone happens to be.
