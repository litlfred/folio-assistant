/**
 * Tests for the bean-body reader, and specifically for the `shadow-checklist`
 * detector added under bean `sfhr`.
 *
 * Each pins a DISCRIMINATION rather than the happy path, because the whole
 * difficulty here is that the defect and a legitimate idiom look almost
 * identical. Measured on this store before the rule was written:
 *
 * | candidate rule | findings | why it fails |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | more than one `## Done when` heading | 34 beans | the real `bbbl` case had NO second heading — the copy was appended bare |
 * | any checklist item below the canonical section | 57 beans | recording a NEW open item in a dated entry is this store's ordinary idiom |
 * | a later item that restates a canonical one | 33 beans | a progress note quoting the item it just satisfied reads the same |
 *
 * What separates them is an ASYMMETRY, and the bean says it outright: *"the
 * ticks were appended as a SECOND copy of the checklist at the foot of the
 * file, so the canonical `## Done when` still read 0 of 2 and any reader or
 * tool consulting it saw an untouched bean."* So the rule is: a later item
 * **ticked** while the canonical item it restates is **open**.
