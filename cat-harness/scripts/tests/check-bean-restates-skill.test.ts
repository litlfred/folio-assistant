/**
 * Tests for the phase-contract detector — bean `folio-assistant-8v0y`.
 *
 * **Every test runs over a SYNTHETIC tree or a literal string.** Nothing here
 * reads `beans/`. That is a requirement rather than a preference: a prior
 * session's tests for this subject walked the real tree five times and pushed
 * a sibling test past its 5 s timeout, and a test that makes a sibling fail is
 * still that test's defect.
 *
 * The load-bearing pair is {@link KN0T_BEFORE} / {@link KN0T_AFTER}: the two
 * states of ONE bean, before and after PR #1185. A rule that cannot separate
 * them is not a rule, whatever else it scores.
 *
 * The rest pin DISCRIMINATIONS rather than the happy path, because every one
 * of them was a measured false positive of a looser rule — see the module docs
 * on `check-bean-restates-skill.ts` for the eight beans and their ids.

| P1 | LHS navbar derived from \`sushi-config.yaml\` | navigation matches the Publisher's for one IG, derived not authored |

| P3 | AST dump behind a flag on the fork | indices/deps marked stale-until-full-run |

It carries the owner's ask verbatim, the five phases with their exit criteria,
the staleness contract, and what is not settled.

### The three drifts, recorded so the repair is checkable

| | this bean said | the skill says |
|---|---|---|
| **P1 exit** | "navigation matches the Publisher's for one IG" | the derived navigation is **diffed** and the difference is **empty or explained entry by entry** |
| **P4 exit** | "a release still cut from a full build, and provably so" | ...and the artefact **says which** build it came from |
| **open items** | 2 listed | **3** |

**Consequence for approval:** P3's exit criterion is not merely hard against
today's data, it is **unsatisfiable**: there are no edges to mark.

## Done when
- [ ] the phases are approved by the owner, or replaced — **as the SKILL states them**
