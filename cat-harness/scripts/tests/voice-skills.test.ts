/**
 * `check:voice-skills` — the gate `schemas/voice-skill.ts` promised.
 *
 * Bean `n8br`. The doc comment said "`check:voice-skills` enforces it" from the
 * day it was written, and four `SKILL.md` files repeat the claim in their own
 * prose. The gate did not exist.
 *
 * **So this file's job is the falsification, not the pass.** A check that
 * reports zero findings over its whole corpus is indistinguishable from a check
 * that cannot fire, and the four voices here produce zero. Every signal below
 * is therefore asserted in BOTH directions: the corpus passes, and a body that
 * restates a rule does not.
