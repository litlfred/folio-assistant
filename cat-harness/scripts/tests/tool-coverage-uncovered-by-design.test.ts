/**
 * `UNCOVERED_BY_DESIGN` — a tier-A skill that is uncovered and should stay so.
 *
 * `tools:coverage` is a report and is in no workflow, so its own non-zero exit
 * reaches only a person who runs it. This file is what makes CI enforce the
 * table, which is the whole point of declaring it rather than writing the
 * reasons into prose: an annotation that says "do not bother" over work that has
 * since become real is worse than no annotation, because it is believed.
 *
 * The test that matters is {@link staleAnnotations} over the REAL corpus. The
 * synthetic ones exist so a failure there can be read — they prove the checker
 * discriminates, so a green real-corpus run is not green by vacuity.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/tool-coverage-uncovered-by-design
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (triages the skills of
 * every instance in the checkout) live in
 * `test/tool-coverage-uncovered-by-design-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`):
 * standing alone, cat-harness has none of it.
