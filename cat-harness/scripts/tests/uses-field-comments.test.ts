/**
 * The editorial graph is built from `uses[]`, and a block whose array cannot be
 * parsed contributes no edges — which is indistinguishable from a block that
 * genuinely declares nothing. So a parse failure here does not produce a wrong
 * answer, it produces a silent absence of one, and every ordering, cone and
 * reachability metric quietly under-counts.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: `content-graph.extractUses` anchored on
 * `/(?:^|[{,])\s*uses\s*:\s*\[/`, and `\s*` does not span comments — so a `//`
 * note between the previous field's comma and the `uses:` key made the match
 * fail outright. **27 blocks and 53 declared edges were invisible**, including
 * `def:crossing-energy` and `def:borromean-baryon`, and a prune-damage audit
 * built on this graph reported those blocks as declaring nothing.
