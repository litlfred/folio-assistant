/**
 * The stakeholder map reports what it can derive, and says what it cannot.
 *
 * The proposed version of this tool read "affected roles from
 * `harness.config.json` and CODEOWNERS" — neither of which exists in this
 * repository, so it would have reported no stakeholders for every change
 * while looking like it worked. These tests pin the two properties that
 * failure mode would have violated: something is actually derived, and the
 * undetermined part is stated rather than rendered as emptiness.
