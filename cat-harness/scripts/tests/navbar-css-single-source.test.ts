/**
 * The two navbar stylesheets may not disagree. Bean `7mog`, issue #1294.
 *
 * ## What this guards, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * `lib/navbar.ts` renders the navbar's markup for every surface (`sjic`, #1264),
 * but its STYLESHEET reaches only the pages it is injected into. The docs site
 * paints the same component from `docs/assets/css/docs-ui.css`. Two files,
 * therefore two chances to say the same thing differently.
 *
 * **Measured before this was written, rather than assumed:** the two share
 * exactly three rules and disagree about none of them. The sidebar is a
 * SUPERSET with a different container — it carries ~50 `fa-nav*` selectors the
 * rail has no counterpart for, including a persisted `data-fa-nav` preference
 * state machine, a `.fa-nav-icons` region and responsive floors keyed to the
 * theme's own column. So this is NOT a test that the two files are the same,
 * and it must never become one: that would fail on the sidebar doing its job.
 *
 * It asserts the narrow, durable property instead:
 *
 * > where both files declare the SAME selector, they declare the SAME thing.
 *
 * Zero drift today is not the same as cannot drift. The open/close control DID
 * come apart once — the sidebar grew a third control and a different placement,
 * and #928 realigned it by hand after the owner reported it. A hand-alignment
 * is a thing that drifts again; this is the version that does not.
 *
 * ## Why parse rather than grep
 *
 * A grep for a declaration finds it inside the comment that explains why the
 * rule avoids it — `sidebar-strip.test.ts` records paying for exactly that, and
 * the fix there was to strip comments before scanning. Comparing parsed
 * selector→declaration maps sidesteps the question: a comment has no selector.
