/**
 * A preview survives a main deploy; a deleted page still disappears.
 *
 * Bean `plj1`. The failure being fixed is INVISIBLE to every existing check —
 * the staging push succeeds, the check run is green, and the artefact is
 * removed minutes later by an unrelated merge — so a green CI run is not
 * evidence here and these tests do not ask for one. They construct the
 * sequence deliberately: a real git remote with a real `gh-pages` branch, and
 * a step-for-step replay of what `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` does at push
 * time (`src/git-utils.ts`, `setRepo`):
 *
 * ```
 * git clone --depth=1 --single-branch --branch gh-pages <remote> workDir
 * git rm -r --ignore-unmatch '*'      # only when keep_files is false
 * cp -R publish_dir/* workDir/
 * ```
 *
 * Both halves are asserted, because they pull in opposite directions and the
 * one-line fix (`keep_files: true`) buys the first by giving up the second:
 *
 * 1. **previews survive** a full-replace deploy once they are restored;
 * 2. **a page removed from `docs/` still leaves the published site** — which
 *    the `keepFiles: true` control below shows it does NOT under the one-line
 *    fix. That control is the evidence for the trade-off, not an assertion
 *    about our own behaviour.
