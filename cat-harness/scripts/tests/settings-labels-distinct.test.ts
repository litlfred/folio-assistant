/**
 * Bean `ob3m` finding 12 — two unrelated panels both called "Settings".
 *
 * The ▦ Actions launcher's sets the PAGE (scheme, reading preferences, the
 * Discarded fish, Declared kinds). The glass's sets the GLASS (theme, avatars,
 * opacity, blur). Neither pointed at the other, so a reader looking for the
 * Discarded items in the glass one found nothing there and nothing saying
 * where else to look.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-01, option 2 of 4: *"Rename: 'Glass settings' and 'Page
 * settings', each with a link to the other."*
 *
 * This is the SOURCE half: the names are declared once and differ, both
 * panels use them, and each panel's builder draws a link to the other. The
 * RENDERED half — that each link is visible, first, keyboard-reachable and
 * actually opens the other panel at desktop and phone widths — is
 * `test/settings-crosslinks.e2e.ts`, because a link that opens nothing looks
 * exactly like one that works from here.
