/**
 * The render target a folio validates against comes from its declared

 * The tests that matter here are the negative ones. A resolver that returns
 * `undefined` for all four misses would pass a "paper resolves to LaTeX" test
 * and still let `validate.ts` report a clean run over a folio whose renderer
 * failed to load.
