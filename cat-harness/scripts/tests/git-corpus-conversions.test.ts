/**
 * `xd1g` — the two-sided control, one case per converted scanner.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists rather than a new gate
 *
 * The obvious guard is a check that finds root-rooted walks and demands they
 * ask git. I built it and it failed its own falsifier, so it is not in the
 * repository: a filter of "binds a root constant AND enumerates" found **62**
 * scanners, most of them correctly reading one declared directory, while a
 * filter of "enumeration SEEDED at a root constant" found **4** and missed
 * eleven of the twelve — they seed a recursion helper or take the root as a
 * PARAMETER. There is no middle setting, because the shapes are not
 * syntactically distinguishable. Shipping it advisory-anyway would be the
 * `1xhc` gate-that-cannot-fail this repository has argued against.
 *
 * So the guard is behavioural and lives with the conversions. A scanner that
 * regresses to a bare walk fails its own case here.
 *
 * ## Both directions, always
 *
 * NARROWING is the point — git ignores what the walk swept. LOSING is the
 * risk, and the count falls either way, so a one-sided test would call a
 * conversion that dropped real files a success. Every case asserts:
 *
 *   1. nothing the new corpus admits was absent from the old  (lost nothing)
 *   2. everything the old admitted and the new does not IS gitignored
 *
 * The second is what makes the first non-vacuous: a `keep` that returned
 * `false` for everything would satisfy (1) and fail (2).
