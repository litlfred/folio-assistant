/**
 * A `fallback` resolves to something real, and the derivation is exact.
 *
 * The property worth pinning is not "the check finds a bad string" — the
 * old version of this file did that, over a field that no longer exists.
 * It is that **the fallback role is recoverable from the diagram**, which
 * is the whole argument for having removed the declaration (bean
 * `folio-assistant-85e8`, on the owner's question about duplicate data).
 * If that derivation ever stops returning `publication-manager` for
 * `qa-report-signing`, the removal was wrong and this says so.

/**
 * The batch, built ONCE at module scope — and the cross-check deliberately BOUNDED.
 *
 * Bean `sff8`. Comparing `fallbackRolesBySkill` against the single-skill path is
 * inherently one full pass per skill: that is the cost the batch exists to remove, so
 * the test proving it correct necessarily pays it. Measured 2026-09-27 at ~1.5 s per
 * single-skill call, and the first version of this test — exhaustive over all skills —
 * took **36 s** and timed out on bun's 5000 ms default.
 *
 * Two moves, both from this bean's own taxonomy, and then a judgement:
 *
 *  - HOIST the shared pass to module scope, where it is charged to no test's budget.
 *  - DERIVE the remaining budget from the population, as
 *    `declared-directory-resolves.test.ts` does for its process-per-module spawn — a
 *    number that grows with the corpus instead of tightening every time a skill is
 *    added. NOT a raised timeout, which this bean rules out.
 *  - and BOUND the sample, because the exhaustive version added **34 s to a ~270 s
 *    suite — 13 % on every run, for every contributor, forever** — to re-check a
 *    property whose structural argument is written out in `fallbackRolesBySkill`'s
 *    docblock (the three filters are independent per node). Spending that on every run
 *    would be this bean's own defect committed by its own fix.
 *
 * So this is a REGRESSION DETECTOR over a fixed sample, not a proof of equivalence,
 * and it is labelled as one. The full 28-skill comparison was run once, by hand, at
 * the commit that introduced the batch: **0 disagreements**, batch 1417.6 ms against
 * 25476.2 ms for the loop.
