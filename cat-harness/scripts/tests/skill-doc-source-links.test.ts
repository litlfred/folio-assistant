/**
 * Every generated skill page's "Generated from" and "Edit this page's source"
 * links RESOLVE to a file in this repository.
 *
 * Bean `folio-assistant-oe98`. 240 of 244 pages linked a path that did not
 * exist — 231 by the pre-split `skills/...` prefix, 9 by a `../bootstrap/...`
 * parent segment no GitHub URL can carry — while `gen-skill-docs --check` and
 * `auto:docs:check` were green throughout. Both compare bytes against what the
 * generator would write; a wrong generator agrees with its own output. This
 * test resolves the link instead, which is the only check that can see the
 * class.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/skill-doc-source-links.test
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (resolves skill sources
 * across every instance in the checkout) live in
 * `test/skill-doc-source-links-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing
 * alone, cat-harness has none of it.
