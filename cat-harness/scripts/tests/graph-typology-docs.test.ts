/**
 * The graph-typology table and the graph-typology registry must name the same kinds —
 * bean `5o3a`.
 *
 * **No check crossed from prose to code, and three clean merges went through the
 * gap.** #266 collapsed the kinds `workplan` and `process-state` into a single
 * `beans`, changed the registry, and left every *description* of it untouched:
 * the table in `directory-conventions.md` still listed both retired kinds at a
 * path that no longer existed, the registry's own doc comment opened "Five, and
 * deliberately none of them renderable" over a map of four, and `AGENTS.md`
 * described an intermediate state of #266's own branch. `AGENTS.md` designates
 * that skill the source of truth, so an agent following it would have written
 * `graph: "workplan"` and been refused by the registry it was told to trust.
 *
 * #269 fixed the instance. This is the guard, and nothing existing could have
 * been it: `gen-skill-docs --check` verifies the generated mirror matches its
 * hand-authored source, so it cannot notice that BOTH describe a registry they
 * no longer match.
 *
 * **The defect is live, not historical.** `kg` was renamed to `cat-harness` on
 * 2026-09-19 — the same class of change as #266, in a file this test now guards.
 *
 * ## Two decisions, and why they went this way
 *
 * **Both directions are hard.** A kind in the table that the registry lacks is
 * the measured defect. A kind in the registry the table omits is the same class
 * reversed, and it means every new kind must land with its prose in the same PR.
 * That is a policy choice rather than a bug fix, and it is priced at zero right
 * now: measured 2026-09-19, both directions were already clean, so this locks in
 * a property the corpus has rather than demanding work to reach it. Softening it
 * is one assertion.
 *
 * **Scoped to the table's first column, never a grep of the file.** #269's
 * rewrites deliberately name `workplan` and `process-state` in prose, to preserve
 * the superseded design and stop somebody re-proposing it; the same file also
 * explains at length that `kg:audit`, `kg-export` and the `kg` QA family keep
 * their names. A text search would read every one of those as a live claim. The
 * table is the machine-readable part, which is the argument for scoping there.
