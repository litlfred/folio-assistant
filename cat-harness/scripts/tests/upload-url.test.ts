/**
 * The upload URL is composed from the declaration, and every failure is named.
 *
 * The regression under test is a real 404: the owner was sent to
 * `/upload/main/uploads` on 2026-09-20 and that path does not exist — the queue
 * is at `cat-harness/uploads`. Verified against GitHub the same day:
 * `/tree/main/uploads` returns 404, `/tree/main/cat-harness/uploads` returns
 * 200.
 *
 * The URL's SHAPE is asserted over a throwaway repository whose `origin` is
 * known (`test/support/git-fixture.ts`), not over this checkout's: standing
 * alone, cat-harness has no `origin`, and the shape is logic over whatever
 * remote it is given. Whether THIS instance resolves — its declaration, its
 * queue on disk, its remote — is a check of this repository's configuration,
 * and lives in `test/upload-url-repo-root.test.ts` at the checkout's root.
