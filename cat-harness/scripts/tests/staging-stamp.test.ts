/**
 * The staging stamp: absent outside a build, declared inside one.
 *
 * Two properties, and the second is the one that was broken. A stamp that is
 * *written* but not *declared* looks correct in every plain-JSON reading and
 * vanishes the moment a JSON-LD processor touches the document — the `ovkk`
 * defect, which is why `context-declares-staging` below asserts against the
 * exported `@context` rather than against the writer.
 *
 * The tests here that read the aggregate repository's own root
 * (`.github/workflows/feature-staging.yml`) live in
 * `test/staging-stamp-workflows.test.ts` (bean
 * `ho66`): standing alone, cat-harness has no such root to read.

 * The export, built ONCE at module scope.

 * Bean `sff8`. `check:test-budgets` named this test at **4.02 s of a 5000 ms default
 * budget (80 %)** before it had ever gone red — it was 7th on that list — and it
 * timed out at **5097 ms** on the next loaded suite run, exactly as ranked. That is
 * the instrument doing the job it was built for: the name arrived before the failure.
 *
 * Same remedy as the five before it: module scope belongs to no test's timeout. Not a
 * raised budget, which `sff8` rules out because a number decays as the corpus grows.
