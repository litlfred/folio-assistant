/**
 * A simulator block's `html:` target is checked, and three states are kept apart.
 *
 * Bean `023p`. Before this, `validate.ts` contained **no reference to
 * `simulator` or `.html`**. Measured on qou 2026-09-19: two of eleven targets
 * existed in neither repository, had been dangling on `main` before any branch
 * touched them, and `run-validate` exited **0** with three issues, none about
 * a simulator. Both dangling blocks passed clean.
 *
 * `SimulatorBlock`'s own doc comment claimed *"Pipeline validates: .html
 * companion exists"*. It did not — a documented check that does not run is
 * worse than an absent one, because a reader stops looking.
 *
 * ## The base path, and the bug that nearly shipped
 *
 * `html:` is documented *relative to repo root*, and that is where the files
 * are: qou declares `simulators/x.html` and they sit at `<repo>/simulators/`,
 * NOT under the folio root at `<repo>/content/`.
 *
 * The first draft resolved against `folioDir()`. Both known-dangling cases
 * still came back `absent` — the right answer for the wrong reason — and the
 * NINE that exist would have been reported missing too. Caught by checking
 * where the files actually are, rather than by re-reading the two cases that
 * confirmed what I expected.
 *
