/**
 * A checker module that will not load is reported once per criterion that
 * names it — and is never imported a second time.
 *
 * This is not a style preference. On Bun 1.3.11 a second dynamic import of a
 * module whose evaluation threw **does not throw again**: it resolves with the
 * namespace of a module whose body aborted partway, and `Object.keys` over
 * that namespace throws `Cannot access X before initialization` for every
 * binding below the throw. Several criteria share one checker file, so
 * discovery imported the same path once per criterion and hit exactly that —
 * the first criterion got an honest "module did not load" and the second took
 * down the whole sweep.
 *
 * The corpus is green, so it cannot pin this. The fixture can.
 *
