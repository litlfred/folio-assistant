/**
 * `l1-blocks.ts` and `gen-library-jsonld.ts` must name a block the same way —
 * bean `xwi8`.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/l1-blocks
 * @graphNode none — a test
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * Both writers put a prose block in `blocks/` for every section. The arm named
 * it `prose-${section id}` — `prose-sec-001-introduction` — and the generator
 * names it `prose-sec-001` through `sectionKey()`. Only the generator's names
 * are referenced by a section node, so a document that went through both
 * carried a second, unreferenced, byte-identical copy of every prose block.
 * Measured 2026-09-23: 91 across four documents, every one identical to its
 * referenced twin apart from `@id`.
 *
 * The test runs BOTH writers on one staged entry and then asks the generator's
 * own orphan detector. A check on the arm's names alone would pass the day the
 * generator's rule changed — the drift this exists to catch.
