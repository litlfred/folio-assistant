/**
 * `ContentDirectory.storage` — a directory kept on a branch, keyed by commit.
 *
 * Bean `16ei`, proposal §2.4. The field changes what three presence checks may
 * conclude from an absent directory, so each is pinned here against a REAL
 * fixture declaration rather than a hand-built object:
 *
 * | consumer | without `storage` | with `storage` |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `check:declared-dirs` | absent → finding | absent → nothing (it is on its branch) |
 * | `harness:dirs` | absent → created | absent → NOT created (an empty working copy reads as clean) |
 * | `audit:coverage` | censused | skipped, and the kind reads `stored` |
 *
 * `keyedBy` is `commit`, `tip` or `route` (beans `2h76`, `9ofm`); `tip` is refused on a `qa`
 * directory. Every real `qa` directory declares it since bean `5hox`, and the
 * last describe block pins the one consequence a fixture cannot: each stored
 * directory's working copy is ignored by version control, so a writer's output
 * is never committed by accident and the removal stays removed.
 *
 * ## The two keyings are NOT the same question (bean `9ofm`)
 *
 * The table above is the **commit**-keyed behaviour, and it stays. For a
 * branch TIP the mount is deterministic, so "not in the checkout" has a right
 * answer and skipping the directory would report a clean run over nothing:
 *
 * | consumer | commit-keyed | tip-keyed |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `check:declared-dirs` | absent → nothing | `not-cut-over` / `unmounted` / mounted → nothing |
 * | `audit:coverage` | skipped, kind reads `stored` | censused at the mount, or kind reads `undetermined` |
 *
 * These cases need a REAL git repository, because the answer is read from
 * `git ls-files` and the mount marker — never from the branch, so the gates
 * stay offline.
