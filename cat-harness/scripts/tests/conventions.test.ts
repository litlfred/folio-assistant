/**
 * A convention applies WHERE IT IS BOUND, and nowhere else.
 *
 * Bean `3190`, in the owner's words: *"coding conventions should also be part
 * of KG. its a specific type of context that should be set depending on the
 * process/workflow (e.g. in software development under CRDM) but not all
 * contexts should have it."*
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion is the NEGATIVE one — an unbound step carries
 * ZERO. A design defaulting to "all conventions" would be the unconditional
 * prose this replaces, wearing a schema, and every other test here would still
 * pass under it. So that case is first.
