/**
 * Tier D meant "no evidence IN THE BODY", and that is not the same thing —
 * bean `6366`.
 *
 * `tools:coverage` triages uncovered skills into four tiers, and decides "has a
 * command" by testing the skill's own markdown for a fenced ```sh block. So a
 * skill that states its rules **without ever showing its command** landed in
 * **D**, the tier whose label reads *"no evidence. Almost certainly
 * judgement."* — and whose members the report does not even print.
 *
 * `ci-health` is the case that proved it: a real command (`check:ci-health`,
 * declared in `package.json`), documented in `AGENTS.md`, reachable from no Tool
 * node, and triaged into D with an **empty evidence list**.
 *
 * That is the same class of error as reading a mechanism from its name: the
 * instrument answered a question about the *prose* and its label made a claim
 * about the *capability*.
 *
 * ## What these tests pin, and why one of them is an invariant rather than a case
 *
 * Asserting "`ci-health` is in tier C" alone would be brittle in a bad way: the
 * day somebody writes its Tool node it leaves the triage altogether and the test
 * fails for the RIGHT reason, looking like a regression. So the case is asserted
 * conditionally and the **rule** is asserted absolutely — no skill with a
 * declared script may sit in D.
 *
