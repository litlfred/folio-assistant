/**
 * Which workflows are OWED for an event — and the three states that must not
 * collapse into two.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/workflow-events
 *
 * Bean `9x9r`. The property under test is not "it parses YAML". It is that
 * **`required`, `conditional` and `not-declared` stay three answers**, because
 * the defect being fixed is exactly a collapse: `check-head-has-run` folded
 * every workflow and every event into one boolean (`runs.length > 0`) and so
 * reported a ✓ on a head whose gates had not run.
 *
 * Every tree here is SYNTHETIC. A prior session's tests in this directory
 * walked the real corpus five times and pushed a sibling past its 5s timeout;
 * and a test reading `.github/workflows/` would pass or fail on whichever
 * workflows happen to exist today, which tests the repository rather than the
 * code. One test does read the real tree, and it asserts only a property that
 * must hold for ANY tree — see its own comment.
