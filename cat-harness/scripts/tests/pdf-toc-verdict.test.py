"""An inferred table of contents has to justify itself. Bean `6xaz`.

`scripts/pdf-structure.py` reads a table of contents from the PDF's embedded
outline when there is one and otherwise INFERS it from heading-shaped lines.
Both used to be emitted with the same authority, and `sections/` recorded
neither, so a consumer could not tell them apart without re-reading
`structure.json`.

**Measured 2026-09-19 on `uploads/WPR-RDO-2020-003-eng.pdf`** (WHO WPRO style
guide, 33pp, no outline): 11 of 13 inferred sections were named after A
DIFFERENT PUBLICATION — 'FACILITY LEVEL: Improving hospital planning and
management', '2.1 Goal - Hospitals as a path to UHC' — scraped off page 22,
which is a SAMPLE TABLE the guide reproduces as a design example. Every one was
stamped `page: 22`, so the collision was visible in the output and nothing
acted on it.

That is worse than shipping nothing. `content/docs/guides-document-ingestion/` argues
an un-ingested source is worse than an absent one "because it produces false
confidence rather than a gap"; a misnamed section is that failure one level in,
because it is greppable, it sits in `library/`, and it answers a question
wrongly with authority.

## What these tests hold

1. The detector fires on a list scraped off one or two pages.
2. **It never touches an outline.** A PDF's own outline is the document's
   answer; `9789241548960_eng.pdf`'s 250 sections must survive untouched. This
   is the falsifier the work was done against, and it is the arm most worth
   keeping.
3. A short document is not condemned for having nowhere else to put its
   headings.
4. End to end over a built PDF whose second page is a sample table: the sample
   does not become the document's structure.
