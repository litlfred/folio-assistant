/**
 * The page corpus is asked of GIT, not of the disk — bean `xd1g`.
 *
 * Why this file exists at all: the predicate was inline first, so nothing could
 * show it working OR broken, and an untestable corpus rule is exactly how the
 * defect survived. Each case below is one of the four states the predicate must
 * keep apart, and two of them are the ones a naive `tracked.has(abs)` gets
 * wrong in opposite directions — a sibling checkout wrongly dropped, and a
 * git-can't-answer wrongly read as an empty corpus.
 *
 * NOT claimed here: that this changes any verdict today. Running the writer
 * with the fix changed no sidecar, so the exposure is LATENT. It is fixed
 * because a measurement that depends on what a gate happened to install is not
 * a measurement.
