/**
 * Every token a theme emits is consumed, and the priority signal survives theming.
 *
 * Two failures this pins, both of which render fine and are wrong:
 *
 *   - an EMITTED, UNCONSUMED token. `--fa-sticky-accent` shipped in exactly
 *     that state on the first pass: written into `themes.css` eight times and
 *     read by nothing, so a theme author could change it and see no effect and
 *     have no way to find out why. CSS ignores it silently, which is what makes
 *     it worth a test rather than a review.
 *   - a theme RECOLOURING the priority stripe. The stripe is a width as well as
 *     a colour because colour alone carrying a signal fails WCAG SC 1.4.1, and
 *     critical/high keep their hues so the same urgency does not read
 *     differently on two boards.
