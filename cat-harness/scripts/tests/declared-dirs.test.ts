/**
 * A declared directory exists, or says why it does not — both directions.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/declared-dirs.test
 *
 * ## Why this check had to be written at all
 *
 * `resolveDirectories` is existence-filtered, so an absent declared directory
 * is dropped before any consumer sees it. Every consumer then reports a clean
 * run over nothing — the `dh4f` shape inside the resolver they all depend on.
 * Bean `8mbk`.
 *
 * ## The resolution rule is what this module got wrong first
 *
 * `scope: "repository"` resolves against the repository root, anything else
 * against the declaring instance's. A first measurement for `8mbk` joined
 * repo-scoped paths belonging to OTHER instances onto the instance root and
 * reported ten phantom absences out of 35 — every one the checker's own error.
 * So the rule gets a test of its own rather than living only inside the sweep.
 *
 * ## Falsified before it was trusted
 *
 * | break | result |
 * |---|---|
 * | phantom directory, no reason | **1 finding**, exit 1 |
 * | same, with `absent.reason` | 0 findings, exit 0 |
 * | `absent.reason` on a directory that EXISTS | **1 finding**, exit 1 |
 * | restored | 0 findings across 66 directories, 14 instances |
