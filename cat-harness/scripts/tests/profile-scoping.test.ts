/**
 * QA criterion scoping by content PROFILE — the second axis, beside adapters.
 *
 * `adapterForKind("prose")` is `"paper"`, and correctly so: profiles nest
 * inside one adapter's vocabulary, so a document folio's prose block is a
 * paper-adapter kind and sails through the adapter gate. Which meant every
 * document-profile block inherited the paper adapter's LaTeX- and
 * Lean-shaped criteria. Measured on `content/docs/crdm-methodology`
 * (2026-09-18, sidecars removed first so nothing was `fresh-skip`):
 * 328 pass / 8 fail / 336 n/a, and **five of the eight failures** were
 * `voice-unicode-crash` — a criterion whose own description says the
 * characters "crash pdflatex" — firing on prose in a folio whose render path
 * never invokes latexmk.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and both are asserted here, in both
 * directions, because the second one fails INVISIBLY:
 *
 * 1. An opted-out criterion is `n/a`'d in a document folio, under its own
 *    outcome string — not the adapter's.
 * 2. An **unannotated** criterion still runs there. `profiles` defaults to
 *    every profile, the opposite of `adapters`; had it defaulted narrow like
 *    `adapters` does, ~110 criteria would have stopped running on document
 *    folios and reported the silence as a clean sweep. A wrong `fail` gets
 *    argued with; a wrong `pass` gets believed.
 *
 * 3. And "could not determine" is a third state that RUNS the criterion. A
 *    folio with no readable `harness.config.json` must not lose coverage
 *    because a tool could not read its configuration.

/**
 * The end-to-end sweeps, run ONCE at module scope — `vxho`'s fix, applied here
 * on its own measurement rather than by analogy.
 *
 * ## Why, with the numbers
 *
 * Each of the four tests below used to call `sweepOutcomes`, and each call
 * `spawnSync`s a whole `bun` process that imports the QA pipeline. Measured
 * 2026-09-27 with `--reporter=junit` (bean `sff8`): the four tests took
 * **4013, 4015, 4049 and 4061 ms** — that is **77-82 % of the 5000 ms per-test
 * budget**, and any jitter crossed it. Four distinct test names have failed this
 * way across runs of one commit.
 *
 * **The inflation factor is 1.0x, not the ~35x this was assumed to be.** Isolated
 * and inside the full 533-file suite the same tests measure within noise of each
 * other, and `--smol` (which this container sets and CI does not) changes nothing:
 * suite totals 308 s against 303 s. So the cost is not contention for a disk — it
 * is four process spawns sitting INSIDE four per-test budgets.
 *
 * Hoisting them out is the whole fix. Module-scope work belongs to no test's
 * timeout, so the tests become assertions on captured data and the wall-clock cost
 * is paid once, at import. THREE sweeps cover FOUR tests: the first two scaffold
 * an identical document folio and only assert different things about it.
 *
 * Each case removes its own temp directory as soon as its outcomes are captured —
 * the `afterEach` above drains `dirs` for the OTHER describe, and a module-scope
 * directory pushed there would be deleted after the first test while later tests
 * still needed it.
