/**
 * The Pages build outcome — bean `3yi4`.
 *
 * `bm6d` measured **6 of the last 10 `pages build and deployment` runs
 * cancelled**, in an exact repeating pattern, and nothing in this repository
 * said so. Three properties hid it at once: those runs are on `gh-pages`
 * rather than the default branch, they are raised by `github-pages[bot]` on
 * the `dynamic` event rather than by a file in `.github/workflows/`, and
 * `check-ci-health.ts` asks `?branch=<default>`. The reader was never missing;
 * the QUESTION was too narrow.
 *
 * ## Why these are pure reducers with no store behind them
 *
 * The owner's correction, 2026-09-20: *"they are not. changes status of repo.
 * tools need to look external."* A Pages deployment is a fact an external
 * service holds. Writing it into the repository would rebuild `xom7` in a new
 * place — a committed answer that is right when written and silently wrong
 * afterwards. So the caller asks the API every time and these functions only
 * reduce what it got back.
 *
 * ## What is pinned
 *
 * That `cancelled` survives as a THIRD state (it is neither "shipped" nor
 * "broken"), and that a cancellation this repository caused itself is
 * distinguishable from one caused by a sibling session. Merging either
 * distinction gives a number that cannot answer the question the report is
 * for: *did the preview actually build?*
 *
