/**
 * An HTML comment cannot nest, and its closing delimiter has no escape.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-19 on `main`: `docs/_includes/head_custom.html` carried a
 * comment that SPELLED both halves of the comment wrapper as an example of
 * what Liquid ignores. The closing half ended that comment eighteen lines
 * early, so the remaining prose rendered as visible body text at the top of
 * EVERY page of the docs site — `head_custom.html` is included site-wide.
 * Nothing caught it: it is well-formed HTML, Jekyll builds it happily, and
 * the CI gates check links, schemas and the knowledge graph, not whether a
 * comment ends where its author meant it to.
 *
 * The defect is undetectable in general — a comment that closes early looks
 * exactly like a comment that closes on purpose. What IS detectable is the
 * only way to author one by accident: an OPENING delimiter appearing while a
 * comment is already open. Comments do not nest, so that sequence is never
 * meaningful. It is either prose about comment syntax (the case that bit us)
 * or a botched edit, and both want a human to look.
