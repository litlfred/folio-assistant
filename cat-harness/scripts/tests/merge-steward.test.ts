/**
 * `merge:steward`'s reading of `git merge-tree`'s CONFLICT lines.
 *
 * The steward asks `merge-conflict-patterns` whether each conflicted path is
 * authored, and that answer decides whether a PR is handed back to a person. So
 * a line read as a filename does not merely mis-parse: it matches no declared
 * pattern, and the PR is blamed for a gap in this parser.
 *
 * Measured 2026-10-04 on #1790, where 8 of 11 reported "authored conflicts"
 * were `CONFLICT (modify/delete)` lines being classified as paths. The earlier
 * spot-check that missed it sampled four PRs whose conflicts were all
 * `(content)` and concluded the parser was sound — a filter over a source read
 * as a claim about the source.
