/**
 * The viewer's words and its table say the same thing.
 *
 * ## Why a test rather than a convention
 *
 * The page looks up a string BY ITS ENGLISH TEXT — that is what a gettext
 * msgid is, and it is what makes a `.po` readable without the page beside it.
 * The cost is that the join is a string literal in two files, and a typo in
 * either one fails SILENTLY: `T("Select a node")` without its full stop finds
 * no entry, falls back to itself, and renders in English forever in every
 * language, looking exactly like a string nobody has translated yet.
 *
 * Nothing else in the pipeline can see that. `--check` compares the table with
 * the catalogues; the e2e suite drives the page in one language at a time and
 * would have to assert every string to notice. This compares the table with
 * the page's own calls, in both directions:
 *
 *   - every `T(...)` in the generator names a string the table declares, so a
 *     typo cannot quietly become an untranslatable string;
 *   - every string the table declares is asked for by the generator, so a
 *     removed line does not leave translators maintaining a dead entry.
 *
 * ## Reading the call sites rather than running them
 *
 * The page's script is a template literal inside `kg-viewer.ts`: it is text
 * here and JavaScript only in a browser, so its calls cannot be executed from
 * a unit test. They are read instead — a literal or a run of adjacent literals
 * joined by `+`, which is how the two long sentences are written to stay
 * inside the line length. A call with a computed argument would not be found
 * by this, and `T(cond ? a : b)` is deliberately written as two separate calls
 * in the generator so that it is.
 *
