/**
 * The voice-overlay criteria are derived from the voices, and the derivation
 * reproduces what four hand-written entries used to say.
 *
 * Bean `btuv`. `qa-criteria-registry.ts` carried one entry per voice, each
 * restating that voice's rules in prose — three of them describing files in
 * ANOTHER instance, and every one of them restating rules without the citation
 * the voice itself carries.
 *
 * **The expected values below are the ones the hand-written entries carried**,
 * captured before they were deleted. They are written here rather than read off
 * the corpus on purpose: a test whose expected value is whatever the code
 * currently produces cannot catch the code changing, which is the whole thing
 * this file is for.
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (derives criteria from
 * the voices folio-assistant-sci, smart-base and who-iris ship) live in
 * `test/voice-criteria-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it.
