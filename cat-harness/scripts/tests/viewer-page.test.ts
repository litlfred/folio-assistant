/**
 * The viewer-page fixture and its audit — bean `edx7`.
 *
 * What these tests are mostly about is the pair of DISTINCTIONS the owner's
 * rule turns on, because getting either backwards would not look like a bug:
 *
 * - *"common fixture **unless explicty removed**"* — a page that declines the
 *   rail and a page nobody wired must not read the same. If `declinesNavbar`
 *   returned false for a real opt-out, the fixture would override a decision;
 *   if it returned true too easily, an unwired page would look deliberate and
 *   the audit would report a clean run over it.
 * - **regression vs. never-railed** — the gate refuses the first and reports
 *   the second. Swapping them makes the gate either useless (nothing fails)
 *   or red on every branch the moment somebody else merges a page.
