/**
 * An unknown attribute on `<cat-harness.processes:bean>` is refused, not ignored.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/bean-attr-refused.test
 *
 * ## The defect, and why nothing could have caught it
 *
 * `readWorkPlanOp` already refused an unknown op VALUE. It silently ignored an
 * unknown ATTRIBUTE, and the two are different checks.
 *
 * `processes/bean-lifecycle.bpmn` records the cost in its own comment: a
 * diagram carried `<cat-harness.processes:bean action="create"/>`, the engine reads `op`, and
 * "the step silently did nothing for weeks".
 *
 * What made it invisible is that an absent `op` is **documented as
 * meaningful** — `ProcessNode.workPlanOp` says it means the step "touches the
 * plan in some way the tools do not perform automatically". So a typo and a
 * deliberate abstention produced the identical parse, and abstention is the
 * reading a reader reaches for. Bean `m8gz`.
 *
 * ## What this must NOT break
 *
 * A bare `<cat-harness.processes:bean/>` is legal and means abstention. A guard that refused
 * it would remove the documented reading instead of the ambiguity, which is
 * why that case is asserted here rather than left implied.
 *
 * ## Falsified before it was trusted
 *
 * | break | result |
 * |---|---|
 * | the attribute guard removed | the `action="create"` test **fails** |
 * | the guard also refusing a bare `<cat-harness.processes:bean/>` | the abstention test **fails** |
 * | restored | all pass |
