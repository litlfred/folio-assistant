  // only from the repository root.
  //

  // in the test file whose whole subject is not confusing those two. The count is
  // legitimately 1 on a developer checkout and legitimately 0 on a runner, and a
  // test that demands either is wrong somewhere.

  // The anti-vacuity guarantee belongs on the FIXTURES, which are
  // environment-independent: the five `distortions` cases above prove
  // discrimination by construction, so `distortions(REPO) === []` is not vacuous
