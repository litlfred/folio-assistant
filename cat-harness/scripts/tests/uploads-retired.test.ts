/**
 * `check:uploads-retired` — the rule this repository wrote down and then broke
 * in the same commit. Bean `q7ey`.
 *
 * The retention rule is the owner's, 2026-09-29: an upload is the archival
 * copy until it is ingested, and then it retires to `fsh-guts/uploads/`. It
 * was written into `library-ingestion` and swept by hand on 2026-09-30, and
 * that one sweep produced four wrong answers:
 *
 *   1. **nine** sources to retire, having resolved `cat-harness/library/`
 *      alone — the answer was 28 across five harnesses;
 *   2. **five RESTORED from git history after deletion** — none had been
 *      deleted; all five sat at `cat-harness/uploads/` continuously and are
 *      in `4b10661cdde` at that path, so the sweep copied a second set into
 *      the archive and reported a recovery with nothing recovered;
 *   3. three more copied rather than moved, original left in place;
 *   4. `who-iris` counted as swept while three ingested sources stayed in its
 *      queue, because that queue keeps a DIRECTORY per source and the sweep
 *      listed only the top level.
 *
 * Every one is the same shape — an answer computed over less than the corpus,
 * indistinguishable from an answer over all of it — and correcting (1)'s
 * number did not stop (2), (3) or (4) inside the same commit. That is the
 * argument for a check rather than a better sweep.
 *
 * ## What each test holds
 *
 * Fixtures are real directories with real manifests, because the contract is
 * "this file's bytes are what some entry derived from" and a mocked hash
 * would test the mock. The cases are the four failures above, plus the two
 * distinctions the remedy depends on:
 *
 *   - **ingested and unarchived** must be a finding (a move);
 *   - **ingested and already archived** must be a finding with a DIFFERENT
 *     remedy (a removal) — conflating them is exactly how eight files ended
 *     up in two places;
 *   - **queued** must not be a finding, or the check tells everyone to retire
 *     work nobody has read;
 *   - matching is on **hash, not filename**: `2509.06388v1.pdf` is archived
 *     as `wang-rangaiah-2026-mcdm-aggregation.pdf`, and a name comparison
 *     would have called that unarchived and produced a ninth duplicate.
