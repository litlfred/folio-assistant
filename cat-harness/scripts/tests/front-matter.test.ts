/**
 * The node summary is what makes an inventory usable, so it is gated.
 *
 * `skill_list` advertised "one-line summaries" in `AGENTS.md` and emitted 150
 * bare names for months. Nothing caught it because nothing asserted it: the
 * tool had no test file at all. The assertions here are therefore about the
 * PROMISE — that a real corpus of skills comes back described — not only about
 * the regex.
