/**
 * `chapters/*.tex` is `content_build` output and lives in the FOLIO. The test
 * helper resolved it as `join(REPO_ROOT, "chapters")` where
 * `REPO_ROOT = resolve(import.meta.dir, "../..")` — this file's own location,
 * i.e. the PLATFORM checkout.
 *
 * So `findChapterFiles()` returned `[]` even with a folio attached, and
 * `latex-lean-coverage.test.ts` — every one of whose assertions needs those
 * files — had never run a single one of them in either repo. Measured against
 * a synthetic folio: 0 pass / 6 skip before the fix, 6 pass / 1 fail after
 * (the failure correct — the fixture carries no Lean source).
 *
 * This is the same split-repo trap the `FOLIO_ROOT` comment two lines below
 * the old declaration already warned about: a folio embeds the platform as a
 * `folio-assistant/` SYMLINK, so `import.meta.dir` resolves back through it to
 * the real platform path and walking up from there never reaches the folio.
 * `QOU_LEAN_DIR`, immediately above, already did the right thing.
 *
 * Resolution happens at module load from `process.cwd()`, so pinning it needs
 * a subprocess launched from inside a folio — which is what this does.
