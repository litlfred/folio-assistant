/**
 * The derived indexes index the artefacts — not their renderings, not their
 * supporting pages, and not a directory that holds neither.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/gen-docs-auto.test
 *
 * Both of the defects pinned here were live in drafts of the generator, and
 * both had the same shape: a second answer to a question the repository
 * already answers.
 *
 *   1,522 skills — every declared directory walked, including `docs/`, which
 *                  holds a generated markdown rendering of every skill.
 *     227 skills — the skill directories walked RECURSIVELY, so
 *                  `skills/<package>/<skill>/<page>.md` counted as a skill.
 *     219 skills — `knownSkills()`'s own number, reached by asking
 *                  `skillMdDirs()` instead of re-deriving what it encodes.
