/**
 * `tool` is a QA subject kind, and its criteria PROJECT rather than decide.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/tool-qa-subjects.test
 *
 * ## What this guards, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * Issue #853 requirement 1: *"Each tool node needs a QA check."* The bean
 * behind it called the 69 Tool nodes unaudited. Measured 2026-09-22, that is
 * true of `kg:audit` and **false of the repository** — `check-tools.ts`,
 * `tools.test.ts` and `check-maintained-artefacts.ts` already decide every
 * property a Tool has.
 *
 * So the criteria here are a REPORTING SURFACE: a committed sidecar per Tool,
 * which is what makes "unbound since it was drawn" distinguishable from
 * "broken in the commit under review". A first draft instead added a
 * `maintains` criterion with its own logic, which would have been a second
 * answer to a question `check-maintained-artefacts` already answers — free to
 * disagree with it. The first test below is what stops that coming back.
 *
 * ## The third state is the load-bearing one
 *
 * `tool-maintains-in-tree` can only ever be `unknown` from a checkout: whether
 * an artefact is in the published tree is a fact about `_site/`, which does
 * not exist here. Recording it as `pass` would be green in exactly the place
 * nobody built the site — `xom7`, where a workflow failed 30 times over two
 * months while a checkout looked clean.
 *
 * ## Falsified before it was trusted
 *
 * | break | result |
 * |---|---|
 * | `tool-maintains-in-tree` returns `pass` instead of `unknown` | **fails** |
 * | `tool-alternative-resolves` returns `pass` instead of `n/a` | **fails** |
 * | `tool` removed from `KG_SUBJECT_KINDS` | does not compile |
 * | restored | all pass |
