/**
 * `kinds` is an array, and the files say what they are.
 *
 * A node declares WHAT TO EXPECT in a directory, not how to tell the contents
 * apart. That division only holds if every kind's files are self-declaring —
 * otherwise a multi-kind node leaves a consumer duck-typing, which is the
 * "distinguishable by extension … a coincidence of the current layout, not a
 * contract" problem #263 named.
 *
 * So these tests pin both halves: the array, and the declarations that make it
 * safe.
