/**
 * The staging slug is one safe path segment, and the reasons are pinned here.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/staging-slug
 *
 * Bean `fuzm`. `feature-staging.yml` builds `rm -rf "STAGING/$SLUG"` and
 * `git add -A "STAGING/$SLUG"` from a sanitised branch name. `.` is in the
 * permitted class and `sed` REPLACES rather than deletes, so input `..` gives
 * output `..` — and `STAGING/..` is the checkout root.
 *
 * The bean's finding was that the safety rested on invariants nothing stated
 * and no test pinned. These tests state them, and they RUN the real things
 * rather than asserting about them: the actual `sed` pipeline lifted from the
 * workflow, the actual `git check-ref-format`, the actual `rm`.
 *
 * Measuring rather than reasoning changed the conclusion twice:
 *   - `rm` refuses `.` and `..` operands outright, so nothing is deleted. The
 *     bean was written believing that was the hazard.
 *   - `git add -A` does NOT refuse, so a `..` slug stages the tree above. That
 *     is the residual, and it is why the guard is on the VALUE.
