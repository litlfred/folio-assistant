/**
 * A skill reference — `name` or `package/name` — names exactly one skill
 * (#1168 B8, owner 2026-09-30: "both; qualify if ambiguous").
 *
 * The schema checks a reference's SHAPE; this checks that it resolves, and
 * that a bare name is not one two packages hold. A bare name that became
 * ambiguous would otherwise resolve to whichever package a scan met first.
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (resolves every skill
 * reference across every instance in the checkout) live in
 * `test/skill-refs-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it.
