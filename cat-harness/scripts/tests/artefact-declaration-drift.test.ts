/**
 * The `maintains` reconciliation, and the narrowing it acquired on 2026-09-20.
 *
 * Written because it had no test and its semantics were about to change. The
 * gate had encoded "an artefact a Tool maintains is produced by the schema
 * exporter", which was true of the three original carriers and of nothing else.
 * `ns-vocabulary` and `content-context` were the first counterexample — both
 * declarations true, both published by `docs-site.yml`, both reported as drift.
 *
 * These tests pin the three findings apart, because the remedies are opposite:
 * `undeclared` means add a Tool node, `unproduced` means the declaration rotted
 * and a consumer would hit a 404, and `missingSource` means the artefact may be
 * perfectly correct while its PROVENANCE is unfollowable.
 *
