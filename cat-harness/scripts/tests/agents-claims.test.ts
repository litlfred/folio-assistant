/**
 * The claims `AGENTS.md` makes about code are checked — and the checker is
 * falsified against the two claims that were actually false.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/agents-claims
 *
 * Bean `77ex`. The bean proposed a LOCATION check and asked, as its third
 * done-when, that it be falsified against real claims from git history.
 * Doing that FIRST is what found the problem: at `08f43c55b2` the file said
 * `resolveSkillDirs` was *in* `schemas/folio-config.ts` and had *no caller*,
 * and the LOCATION half of that was TRUE at that commit. The bean's own
 * design would not have caught its own motivating example, which is why
 * `absenceClaims` exists.
 *
 * The two exclusions in the absence branch are pinned here rather than
 * described, because each turns a true gap notice into a false finding:
 * a symbol's own DECLARATION is not a caller, and a symbol exercised only by
 * its unit test is precisely what "not yet wired in" means.
