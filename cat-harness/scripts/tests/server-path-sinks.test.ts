/**
 * Every external value that reaches a path in the MCP server is CHECKED.
 *
 * Bean `6bhf`, the box that reads *"a gate finds an external value reaching a
 * path join, so the property does not drift back"*.
 *
 * ## Why a source ratchet rather than route tests
 *
 * `src/core/tests/safe-path.test.ts` already pins the helpers thoroughly — 25
 * tests over `safeSegment`, `joinSegments`, `resolveWithin`, `realPathWithin`
 * and `writableWithin`, including the symlink escape that got a **200** out of
 * the lexical-only version. Repeating any of that here would buy nothing.
 *
 * What nothing checked is that the **sinks use them**. That is the gap `6bhf`
 * names, quoting `1wef`: *"somebody had understood this hazard exactly. Nothing
 * checked it, so the correctness was one edit from gone."* It was already true
 * once — three routes were fixed and `/api/import/scan` was missed, so the read
 * primitive survived the fix that was supposed to remove it.
 *
 * The handlers live inside one large `fetch`, reached only by starting a server
 * and doing real filesystem writes, so a route test would need a live port and
 * a temp store per case. This asserts the narrower property a regression would
 * break first: the guard is still adjacent to the sink.
 *
 * **What this is NOT.** A source-text assertion cannot prove a value is
 * validated on every path to a sink; it proves the guard has not been deleted.
 * Anti-vacuity is asserted below so a rename cannot turn it into a silent pass,
 * which is the failure mode of every grep-shaped check in this repository.
