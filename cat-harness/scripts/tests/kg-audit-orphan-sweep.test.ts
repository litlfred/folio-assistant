/**
 * The orphan-sidecar sweep — and it had no test at all until now.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/kg-audit-orphan-sweep.test
 *
 * That gap is the point of this file. The sweep exists to catch a QA sidecar
 * left behind by a subject that moved, and it **shipped silently broken**: the
 * first draft walked `KG_QA_DIRNAME` ("kg-qa") rather than
 * `KG_QA_RESULTS_DIR` ("test/results/kg-qa"), so `readdirSync` threw on a path
 * that does not exist, the `catch` returned, and it reported a clean sweep over
 * nothing on every run. Nothing failed. It was caught only because somebody put
 * the orphan back by hand and watched the guard stay silent — which is the
 * `dh4f` shape produced by the guard written to prevent it.
 *
 * A guard that cannot fire needs a test that watches it fire. These run against
 * a synthetic tree rather than the real results directory, deliberately: an
 * assertion about the real tree pins today's twelve orphans and turns green the
 * moment somebody clears them, which is exactly backwards.
