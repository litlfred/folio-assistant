/**
 * Which actor a script sweep records, and why there are two of them.
 *
 * The owner's ruling (2026-09-22) was to attribute by WHERE the sweep ran
 * rather than by what it is. A single actor would have been simpler and would
 * have said less: a CI verdict is reproducible from the `reviewed_sha` it
 * records, while a local one may rest on an uncommitted edit, so the same sha
 * addresses a tree that produced something else.
