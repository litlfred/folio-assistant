/**
 * A declaration and its bytes must agree — and "deliberately different" is a
 * third answer, not a failure.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-22, choosing how read-only is established: **declare it, and
 * gate that it matches.** The declaration is what a listing reads without
 * scanning a corpus; the gate is what stops it drifting from the nodes.
 *
 * ## The case that added a fourth verdict
 *
 * The first version compared two booleans: declared writable + materialized
 * nodes = contradiction. It fired within minutes on `who-iris/uploads/` — the
 * ingestion DROP ZONE, created by `adapters/document/paths.ts` on a first
 * ingest precisely so somebody can write there. The declaration was right and
 * the gate was wrong.
 *
 * The bytes are materialized; the directory is a write target. A boolean
 * comparison cannot ask the second question, so what separates a deliberate
 * exception from a declaration that is simply wrong is whether anybody said
 * why — `readOnlyBasis`, required on BOTH values, the same way `GateSchema`'s
 * `basis` is required on `permitted` and not only on `refused`.
