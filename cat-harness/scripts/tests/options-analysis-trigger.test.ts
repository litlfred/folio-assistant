/**
 * `Process_OptionsAnalysis` has a way to STOP — bean `u4hs`.
 *
 * `A_Frame`'s documentation has always ended with the trigger question:
 *
 * > *"is this irreversible, or would the answer surprise someone? If neither,
 * > say so and stop; the calling step decides without this subprocess. Stopping
 * > here is a correct outcome, not a skipped step."*
 *
 * And until `GW_Trigger` was added, **the diagram gave it no way to stop.**
 * `A_Frame`'s only outgoing edge went to `A_Select`, so the prose promised a
 * branch the model did not have, and a wired caller had to run all four
 * activities for every decision — the ceremony this process's own documentation
 * refuses: *"a subprocess fired on every decision becomes ceremony, and ceremony
 * is how a gate stops being read."*
 *
 * ## Why it was invisible until the second caller
 *
 * With one caller the straight line looked correct. Wiring
 * `editing-hci-validation` made its corpus-gate tests fail with
 * `Task_RecordDecision is not enabled. Enabled now: A_Frame.` — every write in
 * that process now required a full options analysis, including a spelling fix.
 * **The defect was in the subprocess, and the second caller is what surfaced it.**
 *
 * That is the general shape worth keeping: a subprocess with one caller is a
 * subprocess whose contract has been tested once, by the diagram that happened to
 * fit it.
