/**
 * A mention is not coverage, and an unreadable workflow is not an uncovered one.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/workflow-coverage
 *
 * Bean `7yvd`. The two distinctions this check exists to make are the two a
 * simpler implementation gets wrong:
 *
 *   1. Five diagrams here MENTION a `.github/workflows/*.yml` while
 *      documenting an agent process that merely touches one —
 *      `upstream-pin-watch.bpmn` names `ci-health.yml` and documents neither.
 *      Matching on filename, or on any occurrence, would count all five as
 *      coverage and report a documented repository that is not.
 *   2. A workflow whose YAML will not parse has UNKNOWN triggers. Reporting
 *      that as "dispatch-only, uncovered" shrinks the gate in silence — the
 *      `plj1` shape, a check reporting clean over what it could not see.
