 * something an agent's good intentions do not: that `Commit into the corpus`
 * *cannot* be reported done before the editor has seen the validation findings,
 * because there is no token on it until then.
 *
 * They run against the real `.bpmn` files, not fixtures. A test that passes on
 * a synthetic process while the shipped one has drifted is the failure this
 * repo keeps finding.
 *
 * The tests that walk folio-assistant-core's OWN diagrams — the HCI validation
 * gate, its decisions, its store round-trip — live beside those diagrams, in
 * `folio-assistant-core/scripts/tests/workflow-interpreter.test.ts` (bean
 * `ho66`): standing alone, cat-harness has no such diagram to walk.
