/**
 * Tests for the between-gates tree guard (bean `ymsu`).
 *
 * ## These tests are written against the thing that makes the guard USEFUL
 *
 * The defect being guarded is a check that passed over a state it had never
 * looked at. So a test here that could pass whether or not the guard works
 * would be the same defect one level up — and this repository has paid for that
 * exact mistake: four tests in bean `g196`/`06kg` all asserted what two things
 * SHARE rather than what distinguishes them (`toContain("build details
 * unavailable")` matched the OTHER message; `toContain("fa-build-stamp")`
 * matched the definition rather than the call).
 *
 * So each test below states what it would fail on, and the anti-vacuity pair at
 * the end asserts that the diff is non-empty for a real change AND empty for
 * none — a guard that reports everything is as useless as one that reports
 * nothing, and only checking one direction cannot tell them apart.
