/**
 * The position map `loadChapterGraph` builds is what every detangler criterion
 * runs on, and a block with no position reads as "not listed" and returns
 * `pass`. So a mis-parse here does not produce a wrong answer — it produces a
 * silent absence of checking, which nothing downstream can distinguish from a
 * clean one.
 *
 * These cases came out of the corpus. They were originally pinned against a
 * comment-stripping stopgap; they now run against `parseManifestStringArrays`,
 * which reads every `blocks: [...]` in a chapter manifest by masking strings
 * and comments and depth-scanning for the close.
