/**
 * `gen-navbar-include.ts` — the Jekyll sidebar's navbar, written by the shared
 * renderer. Bean `sjic`, issue #1260.
 *
 * **These test what JEKYLL will do with the bytes**, not whether the committed
 * copy is current. Staleness is the gate's job and is a different question —
 * `artefact-verification.json` is where this repository writes that
 * distinction down, and `library:viz:check` being green over a page that could
 * not run (PR #805) is why it insists on it.
 *
 * The file is generated rather than asserted line by line, so every test here
 * either runs the generator over the REAL data or over a fixture shaped like
 * it. A snapshot would pin the output and tell you nothing about why it is
 * right.
