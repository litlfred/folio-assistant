"""Every package CI installs can actually be imported — bean `68dt`.

`pip install -r requirements.txt` proves the file RESOLVES. It does not prove a
distribution provides the module the declaration says it does, and those two
names differ often enough to matter: `pillow` imports as `PIL`, `PyYAML` as
`yaml`, `pdfminer.six` as `pdfminer`. Until now that mapping existed only as
English inside a comment, where nothing could falsify it.

This is the check that would have caught the failure of 2026-09-19. Every script
here imported `fitz`; the distribution is `pymupdf`, and `fitz` still resolves
but prints a deprecation warning to STDOUT, which corrupted the JSON a caller
parsed. The import worked, so no install-time check could see it — only an
actual import in the environment CI builds.

Read alongside `scripts/check-python-deps.ts`, which is its dual: that one scans
source for imports that are not declared, this one takes the declaration and
tries it. Neither subsumes the other — a package can be declared and unusable,
or usable and undeclared.

LEAN TIER ONLY. `requirements-extended.txt` is deliberately not installed in CI
(`camelot-py` alone is ~323 MB of transitive weight), so asserting its imports
here would fail by design rather than on a defect.

    STRICT: a package line with no `# imports:` above it RAISES. Falling back to
    the distribution name would be a default path, and a parser with one cannot
    tell a missing line from an unremarkable one — it would quietly downgrade
    `pillow -> PIL` to `pillow -> pillow`, which fails for the right reason only
    by luck, and `lxml -> lxml` to the same thing, which fails not at all. The
    pair COUNT is unchanged either way, so the vacuity guard below cannot see it.

    This is bean `ghx3`'s lesson, arrived at there for `roles.json`: a plain
    `z.object` strips an unknown key, so a field an author wrote parses,
    type-checks and reaches no graph. Strict is affordable here for the same
    reason it is there — the file is GENERATED, so every package always has one.
