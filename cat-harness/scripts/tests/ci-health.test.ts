/**
 * A workflow that did not run is a ROW, not an absence.
 *
 * ## The defect these pin
 *
 * Every row in this report used to be derived from the runs. `byWorkflow`
 * groups them, and a group is never empty — so `Health`'s `"no-runs"` state,
 * which `classifyRuns` sets at `runs.length === 0`, was **unreachable**. A
 * workflow with nothing in the window was not a row with a quiet verdict; it
 * was not in the report at all.
 *
 * Measured on this repository, 2026-09-20: **38 workflow files, 3 rows**, and
 * the summary `✓ every workflow … is green`. That is `xom7` — a workflow
 * failing where nobody looks — reproduced inside the module written for
 * `xom7`.
 *
 * ## Why the window is the sharper half
 *
 * `?per_page=100` is a page of RUNS, not a period. On the same measurement it
 * reached back **6.1 hours** (of 1096 runs on the branch). `ci-health.yml`
 * fires weekly and `health-check.yml` daily, so neither could appear however
 * healthy or broken it was — and the report said nothing about the gap.
 * Naming the span is what lets a reader see it.
 *
 * ## The three probe states, which must never collapse
 *
 * The first draft of this change printed "the direct fetch did not answer" for
 * a workflow whose fetch answered perfectly well, with zero runs. Reporting a
 * clean measurement as a failed one sends the reader to debug the tool.

/**
 * "Never run" and "not yet run" are different answers.
 *
 * ## The finding that was not one
 *
 * The change that made `never-ran` visible immediately reported
 * `upstream-pins.yml` — scheduled, asked directly, zero runs on `main`. Every
 * word of that was true and the finding was empty: the file had been added
 * **the previous day**, and its cron is `43 9 * * 2`, a Tuesday two days out.
 * It had never run because it had never had the chance.
 *
 * That is `5rfy`'s ambiguity one level in. The report could see that nothing
 * HAD run; it could not see that nothing COULD have. A workflow neutered for
 * months and one added yesterday rendered identically — and the second is far
 * more common, so the finding would have been noise from its first day.
 *
 * ## Why an approximate cron reading is the right one
 *
 * `cronPeriodDays` answers one yes/no: has the schedule come round since the
 * file appeared? The LONGEST gap suffices for that, and every shape it cannot
 * read returns `undefined`, which leaves the row a finding. Not knowing must
 * never explain a silent workflow away.
