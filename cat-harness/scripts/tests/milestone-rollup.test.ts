/**
 * The milestone closure: transitive, cycle-safe, and three status buckets.

 * Every case here is a shape the bean store can actually hold, and the three
 * that matter are the ones a naive rollup gets wrong: an epic nested under an
 * epic (a fixed two-level walk drops its children), a parent cycle (a naive
 * walk hangs rather than reporting), and a status in neither the open nor the
 * closed set (folding it into either moves the share).
