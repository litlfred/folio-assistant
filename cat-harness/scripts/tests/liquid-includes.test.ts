/**
 * Every Liquid tag in `docs/_includes/` is a real tag, or is escaped.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for, measured 2026-09-19
 *
 * `docs/_includes/head_custom.html` carried, inside an HTML comment, the prose
 * "…the reason this is a JSON island rather than an `{% if %}`". **Liquid
 * parses tags inside HTML comments** — `<!-- -->` means nothing to it — so it
 * saw an `if` tag with an empty expression and the site build died:
 *
 *     Liquid syntax error (_includes/head.html line 70):
 *       Syntax Error in tag 'if' - Valid syntax: if [expression]
 *
 * Two things made it expensive out of proportion to the typo. The error names
 * the THEME's `head.html`, because Liquid attributes an include's line to the
 * includer — so the file in the message is not the file to edit. And the
 * theme is `remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs`, unpinned and fetched
 * at build time, which makes "the theme changed under us" the first and
 * wrongest hypothesis to reach for.
 *
 * ## Why this check and not a real Liquid parse
 *
 * A real parse is better and was used to confirm both the reproduction and
 * the fix (`ruby -r liquid -e 'Liquid::Template.parse(...)'`, strict mode).
 * It is not what runs here: the Ruby Liquid gem is not a dependency of this
 * repo, CI installs bun and not `github-pages`, and a gate that needs a
 * toolchain CI does not have is a gate that gets skipped.
 *
 * So this checks the property that actually broke — every `{% … %}` is either
 * inside `{% raw %}` or is a known tag carrying the expression its form
 * requires. That is strictly weaker than parsing and strictly stronger than
 * nothing, and it would have caught this in the commit that wrote it.
