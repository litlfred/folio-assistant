/**
 * The staging banner is CONSTANT across pages and across rebuilds. Bean `g196`.
 *
 * ## What is pinned, and why it is this rather than "the banner looks right"
 *
 * The bean's whole claim is a storage one: 9 previews took **346.1 MB** of
 * `gh-pages` and **zero HTML blobs were shared between any two previews**,
 * because the commit SHA and a `date -u` build timestamp were baked into all
 * ~530 pages. Since the timestamp changes every run, each re-push added
 * ~27.5 MB of permanently new objects — the history grew even when the
 * preview count did not.
 *
 * So the property that matters is **byte equality**, and the test that earns
 * its place is the one that runs two builds with DIFFERENT facts and compares
 * the emitted HTML. A test asserting the markup contains some string would
 * pass just as happily with the SHA still in it.
 *
 * ## The positive control
 *
 * `staging.json` must still DIFFER between those two runs — otherwise the
 * facts went nowhere and the banner is constant because it is empty. Both
 * halves are asserted together for that reason.

 * present on a `who-iris` page, absent on the folio-assistant landing page of
 * the same preview.
 *
 * `docs/_includes/head_custom.html` sits in the `<head>` of every
 * just-the-docs page and contains, as PROSE, the sentence
 *
 *     A browser hoists a stray `<div>` into `<body>` and the code still works
 *
 * so the first `<body>` in the document was inside an HTML comment. The
 * non-global `replace` spent its one substitution there and the real tag,
 * hundreds of lines later, got nothing. `who-iris` pages are generated
 * without that include, which is why half the preview worked and the failure
 * read as a `who-iris` feature.
 *
 * MEASURED ON THE DEPLOYED TREE rather than inferred: of 670 staged pages,
 * 347 carried the banner correctly and **323 carried it inside a comment** —
 * 48 % of the preview, invisible, while the injector reported all 670 as
 * injected.
