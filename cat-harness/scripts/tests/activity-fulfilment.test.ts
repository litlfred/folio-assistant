/**
 * Which actor kinds may perform a step, and how the diagram says so.
 *
 * ## The question this answers, which nothing could answer before
 *
 * *"Tasks can be fulfilled by only certain actor types."* An actor is human,
 * agentic or mechanical (`schemas/skill-package.ts`), and those are not
 * interchangeable: an agent exercises judgement and a mechanical system runs a
 * procedure. So a step that requires a judgement cannot be handed to a build
 * pipeline, and a step that is a fixed program does not need a reader.
 *
 * ## Why almost no diagram has to declare anything
 *
 * **BPMN already says it, per task type, and nothing was reading the answer.**
 * A `userTask` is performed "by a human being with the assistance of a software
 * application"; a `serviceTask` "uses some sort of service … a Web service or
 * an automated application", with no human in the loop. So the constraint is
 * DERIVED for 247 activities in this corpus without a line of new markup, and
 * `<folio:fulfilment/>` exists only for the step where the derived answer is
 * wrong.
 *
 * An abstract `bpmn:Task` and a call activity assert **nothing**, and that is
 * recorded as nothing rather than as "every kind allowed" or "no kind allowed".
 * Both of those would be claims the diagram did not make.
 *
 * ## Why the reason is required at LOAD time
 *
 * `<folio:fulfilment/>` can SILENCE a finding, and the cheapest way to make
 * `activity-fulfilment-kind` pass is to widen `kinds` until it does. Same rule
 * as `<folio:no-skill reason>`: a reasonless exemption does not parse, so the
 * whole diagram records `unknown` instead of quietly passing, and silencing the
 * criterion costs more than satisfying it.
