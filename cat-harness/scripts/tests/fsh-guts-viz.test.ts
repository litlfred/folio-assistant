/**
 * The two ways `gen-fsh-guts-viz` misread a non-markdown node.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/fsh-guts-viz.test
 * @graphNode none — a test
 *
 * Both were found on 2026-09-30, the moment bean `q7ey`'s sweep put 33
 * archived PDFs and 7 extraction records into `fsh-guts/uploads/`. Neither is
 * about the sweep: both had been live since the viewer was written, with one
 * pre-existing file (`detangle-schema-viewer.html`) sitting in the first of
 * them the whole time. They are here because a generator that reports a false
 * finding, and a generator that prints binary onto a page, are the two
 * failures a reader cannot tell from correct output.
