/**
 * No published graph mentions `fsh-guts`.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-19: *"NEVER include fsh-guts, references to fsh-guts
 * stripped out of KG before sending to publication."*
 *
 * Bean `folio-assistant-uv09`. This is a CORRECTION to work shipped earlier
 * the same day: `fsh-guts/` was kept out of the render pipeline and tested
 * (`fsh-guts-not-rendered.test.ts`), which is a different property from
 * keeping it out of the GRAPH. An instance's declared directories become
 * nodes in `<stub>.jsonld`, so declaring the trashcan locally — required, or
 * no tool can find it — put its id, path and description into the published
 * document.
 *
 * **Not a contradiction of `<base>/fsh-guts.jsonld`.** That document IS the
 * trashcan's graph and is asked for by name. Every OTHER published artefact
 * must carry no path to it: a consumer may go there deliberately and must
 * never arrive by following an edge.
