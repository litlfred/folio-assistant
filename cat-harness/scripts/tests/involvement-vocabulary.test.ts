/**
 * `<cat-harness.processes:involvement vocabulary="…"/>` — RACI's four letters or RASCI's five.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/involvement-vocabulary
 * @graphNode none — a test
 *
 * Issue #1004. **The load-bearing cases here are the refusals**, for the
 * reason this whole change exists: until 2026-09-23 an involvement outside the
 * vocabulary was filtered out inside `loadProcessModel` and the comment at the
 * filter claimed `check:raci` reported it. Nothing did — the rejects were gone
 * before any row was built, and `process-model.ts` was the only reader of the
 * raw element, so no other consumer could have caught them either.
 *
 * A test that only showed the corpus passing would have passed throughout that
 * entire period. So every case below is about what happens to a value the
 * vocabulary does not admit.
