/**
 * The vocabulary emits SKOS — bean `fd6i`, and `lqo9` slice 1.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/ns-export-skos
 * @graphNode none — a test
 *
 * `skos:` has been bound in the published `@context` since it was written
 * (`schemas/jsonld.ts:551`, and the shipped `ns/content/v1.jsonld`), and
 * `schemas/tabular-csvw.ts` states in prose that this graph "already speaks
 * eight published vocabularies — doco, deo, cito, oa, prov, **skos**, dcterms,
 * fhir". Measured while holding the `lqo9` roast, `skos:` was emitted by
 * **zero** nodes. The claim was false, and nothing broke, which is exactly why
 * it survived — the `dh4f` shape one level up, in the vocabulary rather than
 * in a directory.
 *
 * ## Why these assertions are shaped the way they are
 *
 * **Every count is checked against zero before it is checked against anything
 * else.** A suite that asserted "every concept has a definition" would pass
 * perfectly over a document containing no concepts — which is the state this
 * file exists to make impossible, so it is the state the tests have to be
 * unable to sit in. That is `6tkl`, and it has already been introduced here
 * once by a change whose own tests were meant to guard it.
 *
 * **The schemes are checked for members, not merely for existence.** An
 * emitted `skos:ConceptScheme` that nothing is `inScheme` of is a declaration
 * whose consumer scans nothing and reports a clean run — `dh4f` again.
