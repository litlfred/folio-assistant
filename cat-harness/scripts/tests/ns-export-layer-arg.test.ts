/**
 * `--layer`'s verdict and its error message are ONE read of `TERM_LAYERS`.
 *
 * Issue #807. The predicate and the sentence used to be two literals, and they
 * drifted through the `cat-bootstrap` -> `bootstrap` rename: the check still
 * listed `cat-bootstrap` while the message beside it already said `bootstrap`,
 * so refusing `--layer bootstrap` printed
 *
 *     --layer must be bootstrap, harness or core (got bootstrap)
 *
 * a sentence that names the value it has just refused. The rename was the
 * trigger; the DEFECT was that nothing tied the two together, and nothing
 * could have caught it — the branch lived inside `import.meta.main`, reachable
 * only by spawning the script and reading stderr.
 *
 * So these assertions are deliberately about the RELATION between the message
 * and the accepted set, never about the sentence's wording. A test that
 * asserted the string "bootstrap, harness or core" would be a third copy of
 * the list, and would have passed just as happily while the predicate said
 * something else.
