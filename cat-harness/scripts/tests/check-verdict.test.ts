/**
 * The three states, and the two bugs that made them two.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/check-verdict
 *
 * Every fixture is SYNTHETIC. The subject is a classification, so reading the
 * real API would test GitHub's current weather rather than this code — and a
 * test that passes or fails on whichever runs happen to exist today is the
 * `9x9r` shape one corpus over.
 *
 * The property under test is that `pass`, `fail`, `pending` and `undetermined`
 * stay FOUR answers. Both bugs this module was written for were collapses:
 * `cancelled` folded into failure (reporting a green `main` as red), and
 * `stale` folded into failure for the same reason one draft later.
