/**
 * `BLOCK_KINDS` was one global pool with a compile-time exhaustiveness proof
 * against the `Block` union. Adding WHO L2/L3 kinds to that pool would make
 * every math axis nominally applicable to a FHIR ValueSet and every WHO axis
 * applicable to a lemma — and the failure would not be a visible `n/a` but a
 * `voice-scholarly-default: fail` on a decision table, which reads like a real
 * finding.
 *
 * So kinds are scoped by content adapter, and QA criteria carry an adapter
 * scope that the sweep gates on before it gates on companion files.
 *
 * The load-bearing choice is the **default**. `adapters` absent means
 * `["paper"]`, not "all": every one of the criteria in the registry today was
 * written for the paper adapter, so defaulting to "all" would need all ~47
 * edited to stay correct and would misfire silently on any that were missed.
 * These tests pin that default, and pin that the change is a no-op for every
 * kind the existing corpus actually contains.
 *
 * Since bean `1335` the `dak` adapter is not built in: smart-base contributes
 * it. The tests that pinned the DAK vocabulary itself moved to
 * `smart-base/schemas/dak-blocks.test.ts`; what stays here is how CORE scopes
 * criteria to an adapter, checked against the contributed adapter the way a
 * running sweep sees it — through the registry `loadContributions` fills from
 * this checkout's declared dependencies.
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (reads the adapters and
 * block kinds the content instances contribute (smart-base's `dak`)) live in
 * `test/adapter-scoping-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`): standing alone,
 * cat-harness has none of it.
