/**

 * The report carried "(dispatch-only, or vendored for a folio)" over a count of
 * 31 — a cause asserted rather than measured. These pin the four answers, and
 * three of them are regressions against drafts of this classifier rather than
 * hypotheticals.
 *
 * Imported from `src/workflow/workflow-triggers.ts` rather than from the
 * script: an earlier draft exported them from `check-ci-health.ts` and this
 * file ran the whole CI-health report — a hundred GitHub runs — on import.
