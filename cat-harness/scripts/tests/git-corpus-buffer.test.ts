/**
 * A corpus listing bigger than node's default buffer must still be a corpus.
 *
 * ## The defect, measured 2026-09-30
 *
 * `spawnSync` caps a child's stdout at **1 MiB** unless told otherwise, and on
 * overflow it sets `error` (`ENOBUFS`) rather than truncating. Both corpus
 * helpers read `r.error !== undefined` as *"git could not answer"*, so the
 * whole repository became invisible to every caller the moment its PATH NAMES
 * — not its contents — outgrew that buffer:
 *
 * | | `git ls-files -z --cached --others --exclude-standard` |
 * |---|---:|
 * | `origin/main` at 874d4c9bfb8 | 1,005,252 bytes |
 * | this branch, +740 ingested library files | **1,058,420 bytes** |
 * | node's default `maxBuffer` | 1,048,576 bytes |
 *
 * `iri:sync:check` exited 2 with *"git could not list the corpus, so nothing
 * was checked — that is not a pass"*, which is the correct refusal. The danger
 * is the callers that do the other thing: several fall back to a filesystem
 * walk, and a walk is a DIFFERENT corpus with different exclusions. #1609
 * measured that direction — converting one walk to git moved 21 archived beans
 * into findings — so crossing the buffer silently rescopes those checks rather
 * than stopping them.
 *
 * ## Why this test builds a corpus rather than reading an option
 *
 * Asserting `maxBuffer` is passed pins the spelling of the fix, and there are
 * two helpers in two instances that may not import each other (bean `xsqm`),
 * so the constant cannot be shared and an option assertion would have to be
 * written twice against two literals. What both must do is ANSWER, so both are
 * asked, over a scratch repository whose listing is deliberately past 1 MiB.
 *
 * Reverting either `maxBuffer` turns its case red — checked by hand, both
 * directions, on 2026-09-30.
