/**
 * `blockPlacement` / `pointsForward` exist so a caller can cost a proposed
 * `uses[]` edge before writing it — restoring a pruned dependency adds a
 * `uses[]` entry, and if the target sits later in the same chapter that is a
 * forward reference, which is the metric the detangler arc has been reducing.
 *
 * The contract these pin is the three-way outcome. `unlisted` and
 * `unavailable` must stay distinct, and `pointsForward` must answer
 * `undefined` rather than `false` when it cannot tell — conflating "I could not
 * check" with "it is fine" is the exact defect this area keeps producing
 * (`checkDetanglerNoForwardRef` returns `pass` for an unpositioned block, so an
 * unbuilt graph and a clean corpus read identically).
