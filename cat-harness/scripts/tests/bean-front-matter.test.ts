/**
 * The front-matter gate fails on the defect it was built for.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/bean-front-matter.test
 *
 * Bean `t7ao`'s own Done-when asks for this in as many words: *"a test that
 * FEEDS IT A BROKEN BEAN and asserts it fails. A gate for this defect that has
 * never seen the defect is the defect."*
 *
 * The fixture is the REAL failure, not an invented one. `224e0beac8` committed
 * a bean whose line 8 was a literal `\1` — an unsubstituted sed backreference
 * where `updated_at:` belonged — and `bun run gates --all` passed 92 gates over
 * it before `beans list` failed for every reader in the next shell. That exact
 * byte sequence is what `BROKEN_FRONT_MATTER` below reproduces.
