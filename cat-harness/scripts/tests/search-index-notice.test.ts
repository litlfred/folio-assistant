/**
 * A preview says which index its search box is searching.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/search-index-notice.test
 *
 * ## The ruling this implements, and the rule it narrows
 *
 * Bean `eof6` concluded that staging must **disable** search outright, on the
 * grounds that a stale hit is *"a wrong PASS, BELIEVED"*. The owner ruled
 * otherwise on 2026-09-22: *"staging uses last published index (w/ wanrnig)"*.
 *
 * The ruling holds against the objection because **belief** was the
 * load-bearing word, and a warning is what attacks it. The narrower rule:
 *
 * > Unmarked staleness is worse than absence. Marked staleness is not.
 *
 * So the swap is never silent, and that is what is asserted here.
 *
 * ## Why the decision is a pure function
 *
 * `searchIndexNotice` maps the stamped state to its text and touches no DOM,
 * precisely so it can be checked without a browser. Rendering needs a built
 * page; deciding does not. Only the rendering is left to CI's e2e job, and
 * the text it renders is pinned here.
 *
 * ## The CSS half, and the mistake it is guarding
 *
 * A first draft styled the notice with `--fa-accent`, `--fa-surface-2` and
 * `--fa-ink-dim`. **None of the three exists.** The existing token tests did
 * not catch it, and could not: they forbid a raw hex rather than requiring a
 * defined name, and an undefined custom property is not a CSS error — it just
 * renders unstyled. So this file checks that every token the rule references
 * is actually declared somewhere.
