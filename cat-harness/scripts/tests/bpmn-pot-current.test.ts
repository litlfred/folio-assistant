/**
 * Every diagram has a current `.pot` in every locale that translates diagrams.
 *
 * ## Why this is a test and why the gate is per-locale
 *
 * `render-bpmn` has `render:bpmn:check` and `AGENTS.md` records why at length:
 * a generated artefact with no staleness check drifts silently. `translate-bpmn`
 * had no counterpart, so adding a diagram and not re-extracting cost nothing
 * until somebody ran extract by hand. Bean `0hd6`, measured 2026-09-19:
 * **12 of 32** diagrams had no `fr` template at all, and **18 of the 20 that
 * existed were stale** — still naming `.beans/`, the dot-prefixed directory
 * that moved to `beans/` on 2026-09-18. A translator working from those would
 * have translated a path that no longer exists.
 *
 * The gate is per-locale because `fr` is the only locale with workflow
 * coverage; `ar`, `es`, `ru` and `zh` carry `kg-viewer` and nothing else.
 * Demanding 32 templates each would invent 128 files of coverage those locales
 * do not have anywhere, which is worse than the gap. They are REPORTED by the
 * checker instead — a locale scanned, found empty and called clean is the
 * `dh4f` defect.
 *
 * ## Read a failure here as one of two things
 *
 * A diagram you added needs `bun run translate-bpmn --extract`, or a diagram
 * you edited changed a label and the template must follow. Both are the same
 * one-line fix. What a failure is NEVER is a reason to drop the locale from
 * the gate.
