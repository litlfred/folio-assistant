/**
 * Exit-code contract for `check-ci-health.ts`.
 *
 * Two callers depend on it and want opposite things, which is the entire reason
 * `--out` exists as a separate flag from `--markdown`:
 *
 *   - `session-start-coord-sweep.sh` runs `--markdown` as
 *     `if ! bun run … --markdown; then <print "Not checked — treat as unknown">`.
 *     If `--markdown` ever exited non-zero on a red, the sweep would print the
 *     report AND declare it unchecked, every single time CI was red.
 *   - `ci-health.yml` needs the report body *and* a real verdict, and must
 *     never close its tracking issue on a repo it could not check.
 *
 * These run against a git repo with no `origin`, which drives the checker into
 * its `unreachable` branch without touching the network — so the tests are
 * deterministic and offline. Bean `ynu8`.
