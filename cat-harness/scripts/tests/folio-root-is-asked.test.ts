/**
 * The folio root is ASKED for, never spelled.
 *
 * Bean `hs08`. The owner's ruling is that a folio says where its content is —
 * *"qou can declare a new folio at content/"* — and `folioDir` is the one
 * place that reads the declaration. This is the ratchet that keeps it the one
 * place.
 *
 * ## Why a ratchet rather than a convention
 *
 * Before `folioDir`, **162 sites** spelled the folio root as a literal. Not
 * one of them was wrong when it was written; each was the obvious way to name
 * a directory, and together they made the declaration unreadable — a folio
 * could declare `content/` and be invisible anyway. A convention would have
 * produced them again, one plausible line at a time.
 *
 * The failure this guards is silent by construction: a reintroduced literal
 * breaks nothing in THIS repository, which has no folio to look in. It breaks
 * a downstream folio that declared a different path, and it breaks it by
 * finding nothing rather than by erroring. Nobody here would see it.
 *
 * ## What is allowed, and why
 *
 * - `schemas/cat-harness.ts` — `folioDir` itself. It IS the base case: the
 *   convention has to be written down once, and resolving it through a
 *   declaration would be circular.
 * - `*.test.ts` — fixtures BUILD trees rather than resolving them. A test that
 *   writes `<tmp>/folio/paper` is constructing a world, not reading one.
 *
 * Everything else asks.
 *
