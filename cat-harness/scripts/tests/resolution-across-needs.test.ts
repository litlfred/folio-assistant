/**
 * A reference resolves against this instance AND everything it `needs`.
 *
 * Both graphs: a `<skill ref>` against the reachable SKILLS, a `<role ref>` and
 * every RACI value against the reachable ROLE IDS. One file because it is one
 * rule with one direction — resolution follows `needs` downward — and splitting
 * it would let the two halves drift on the question they share.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * `kg-audit.ts` resolved every `<bootstrap.processes:skill ref>` against
 * `knownSkills(root)` — the audited instance's OWN skills and nothing else. A
 * skill that legitimately lives in a DEPENDENCY therefore dangled.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-27, before the fix: `kg:audit --instance ./smart-base`
 * reported `skill-ref-resolves` **fail (9)** on nine activities of
 * `methodologies/processes/diig-investment-path.bpmn`. All nine named the one
 * skill `methodology-adoption`, which lives at
 * `cat-harness/skills/process/process-core/methodology-adoption.md` — four layers down
 * smart-base's own declared `needs` chain (`smart-base → fhir-harness →
 * folio-assistant-core → cat-harness → bootstrap`). Nine criticals against a
 * diagram that is correct.
 *
 * The auditor's own run already disagreed, in a committed artefact:
 * `cat-harness/test/results/kg-qa/_external/smart-base/…/diig-investment-path.kg-qa.json`
 * recorded `skill-ref-resolves` **pass (0)** for that same file (deleted 2026-10-01
 * as a duplicate of the owner's own verdict, Q-A PR 4), because from
 * the auditor's root the skill is local. **Two runs, one diagram, two answers**
 * — and the instance-scoped one was wrong.
 *
 * ## Why this is the FIFTH cross-instance defect and none of the first four
 *
 * The other four leaked things an instance should NOT see — a repository's
 * actors read as one instance's roles (73 false criticals), its capabilities,
 * 119 phantom tool sidecars, 23 skills from `.claude/skills/`. Every one was
 * fixed by NARROWING. This one is the opposite polarity: an instance could not
 * see what is legitimately BELOW it. No narrowing fix could find it, which is
 * exactly why it survived all four.
 *
 * ## Why an invariant and not the nine findings
 *
 * Asserting "smart-base reports zero" pins today's corpus: the diagram may be
 * edited, the skill may move, and the test then passes for the wrong reason.
 * The rule is that **no ref is reported dangling when the instance's own
 * `needs` closure holds it**, stated over every instance that declares one —
 * with an anti-vacuity floor, because on a corpus where every ref happens to
 * be local the invariant holds trivially and would keep passing through a
 * regression. That floor is the shape whose absence let the original defect
 * sit unnoticed.
