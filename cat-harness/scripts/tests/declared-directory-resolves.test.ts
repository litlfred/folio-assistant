/**
 * Every module that resolves a DECLARED directory can actually resolve one.
 *
 * ## What went wrong
 *
 * `folio` is registered into the graph-kind registry by an IMPORT SIDE EFFECT
 * at the bottom of `schemas/folio-graph-kind.ts`, and that module's own
 * comment says why: *"Registering on import is what makes `folio` available to
 * anything that imports core. The harness alone never sees it."* The layering
 * is deliberate — `folio` is CORE's kind and the harness must not know it.
 *
 * The consequence is not deliberate. Whether a script works depends on whether
 * something in its import graph happened to pull that module in. Measured
 * 2026-09-20 across the 20 modules that call `directoriesForGraph`: **10 threw**
 * `unknown graph kind "folio"` on their first call — among them
 * `scripts/narratives.ts`, the human review queue, and `src/tools/translation.ts`,
 * an MCP tool.
 *
 * ## Why nothing caught it
 *
 * Every gate passed. All 3 298 tests passed. `check:harness-dirs`,
 * `kg:schema:check` and `docs:harness:check` — the three that
 * `schemas/cat-harness.ts` explicitly predicts will throw when a `folio`
 * directory entry is added — all passed, because each runs inside a process
 * that reaches the registration transitively.
 *
 * A test suite has the same problem in a sharper form: one module importing
 * core registers `folio` for the *whole process*, so every module tested after
 * it passes regardless. That is why this spawns a FRESH SUBPROCESS per module.
 * Testing them in-process would be a check that cannot fail.
