/**
 * `cpss` boxes 3 and 4 — the convention is enforced, and the enforcement can
 * fail.
 *
 * The corpus test says the repository is currently correct. The fixture tests
 * say the check would notice if it were not, which is the half that a check
 * asserting a property of the current tree cannot establish about itself.
 *
 * ## The control that matters most is not in this file
 *
 * Recorded here because it is evidence and it is not reproducible from a
 * fixture: run against `.github/workflows/code-quality-gates.yml` **as it stood
 * on `main` before the fix**, `redGateIsLast` reports both defects bean `cpss`
 * documented, independently of the bean —
 *
 *     [shares-a-step] ... shares step "gates that were registered and never run"
 *                         of job `gates` with 106 other gate(s)
 *     [not-last]      ... is step 46 of 51 ... and 5 step(s) follow it
 *
 * — matching the 107 invocations and 5 trailing steps measured by hand on
 * 2026-09-26. That is not asserted as a test, on purpose: pinning a historical
 * blob makes a test that decays into a statement about `origin/main` at some
 * past moment, and the fixtures below assert the same two rules without a date
 * on them.
