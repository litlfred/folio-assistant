/**
 * The issue-body dashboard.
 *
 * The property that matters is NOT how it looks — it is that a field the
 * agent cannot compute never renders as one it can. #203 asked for a status
 * vocabulary whose halves have different epistemic status: `synchronized` /
 * `ready for review` / `dirty` are derivable, `stalled` and level-of-effort
 * are judgements. A PM reading an invented estimate styled like a
 * measurement will plan against it.
