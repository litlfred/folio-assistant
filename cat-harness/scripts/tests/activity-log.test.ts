/**
 * The whole KG export, built ONCE at module scope.

 * Bean `sff8`. This was `await buildExport()` inside the test body, and measured
 * 2026-09-27 it is **3638.8 ms of a 3.98 s file** — 73 % of bun's 5000 ms default
 * budget with the machine IDLE. So the test did not fail because contention
 * inflated something small; it was always nearly over budget, and any load at all
 * tipped it. It timed out at **5211 ms** in a loaded full-suite run.
 *
 * That is the same shape as `profile-scoping.test.ts` — the test's own work, not
 * contention — and the same remedy: module scope belongs to NO test's timeout, so
 * the cost is paid once and budgeted against nothing. `vxho` established the
 * pattern.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does NOT do. It is not a raised timeout, which
 * `sff8` rules out because a bigger number decays as the corpus grows. And it does
 * not swallow a failure: a throw here fails the FILE rather than one test, which
 * is better signal than a timeout that says only "5000 ms elapsed" — the same
 * reasoning as `sweepOnce` throwing rather than calling `expect` at module scope.
