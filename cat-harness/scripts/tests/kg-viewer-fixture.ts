/**
 * A viewer page with a catalogue in it, for the tests that need one.
 *
 * ## Why a fixture rather than a shipped language
 *
 * The repository ships **no translated catalogue**: every
 * `translations/<locale>/kg-viewer.po` carries the msgids with an empty
 * msgstr, awaiting a person. That is the decision, and it is the right one — a
 * machine translation into a language nobody here reads is an artefact whose
 * correctness cannot be checked here, and a header calling it unofficial does
 * not change what a reader sees.
 *
 * It leaves the switcher, the language announcement, the right-to-left flip
 * and the per-string fallback with nothing to exercise them, in a repository
 * whose own accessibility skill says that a check which does not run is a
 * habit rather than a rule. So the tests generate a page with a catalogue of
 * their own.
 *
 * **It is the real generator**, called the way the CLI calls it, with
 * different data — not a hand-written page that could agree with the tests
 * while disagreeing with what ships.
 *
 * ## The fixture locale
 *
 * `qaa` is reserved by ISO 639-3 for local use, so it names no real language
 * and cannot be mistaken for one. Its strings are the English wrapped in
 * guillemets — pseudolocalisation, legible to a reviewer who reads only
 * English and obviously not a translation.
 *
 * It is deliberately PARTIAL. The strings left out are what proves an
 * untranslated entry falls back to English rather than rendering blank, which
 * is the path EVERY shipped locale is on today.
 *
 * It declares itself right-to-left, because Arabic is a language this viewer
 * is meant for and the direction flip is the one thing no left-to-right
 * catalogue could test.
 *
 * ## The msgids are taken from the table, never retyped
 *
 * A fixture carrying its own copy of a string is a fixture that goes stale
 * silently: the page would fall back to English, the assertion would fail, and
 * the failure would look like a bug in the page. Each one is looked up, and a
 * lookup that misses throws here rather than at the assertion.
 *

 * `../folio-assistant.jsonld`: four catalogue specs failed on a 404 that had
 * nothing to do with catalogues. A comment asserting a value does not keep it
 * true; reading it does.
 *
 * The fixture DIRECTORY keeps its own name. It only has to sit one level under
