/**
 * `gen-themes-css.ts` emits INSTANCE-declared sticky themes, generically.
 *
 * Bean `v8n5`. `themeByRef` could resolve who-iris's own sticky theme for a
 * card while this generator emitted CSS for the platform's themes only, so the
 * card named a theme and rendered on the default — a fallback that looks like
 * a working page. These tests pin the three things that close it:
 *
 *   - an instance sticky theme passed in IS emitted, labelled with its owner;
 *   - the COMMITTED stylesheet carries every instance sticky theme this
 *     repository declares, so a card citing one cannot silently fall back;
 *   - the generator's source names no instance and holds no colour value —
 *     the values arrive from the instance's `themes.ts` at build time.
 *
 * The tests of this file that read the whole checkout (reads every instance's
 * sticky themes) live in `test/gen-themes-css-checkout.test.ts` (bean `7zz1`):
 * standing alone, cat-harness has none of it.
