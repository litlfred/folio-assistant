/**
 * Subprocess descent — a call activity IS the process it names.
 *
 * Before this, a `callActivity` was an opaque box the caller completed in one
 * step, which meant a decomposed diagram was strictly WORSE than a flat one: it
 * read better and gated less.
 *
 * The cases here run on FIXTURE diagrams only. The cases that walk a real
 * decomposed process moved with that process to
 * `folio-assistant-core/scripts/tests/l1-ingestion-subprocess.test.ts` in
 * placement PR6 (bean `apcg`): `document-ingestion.bpmn` became the harness's
 * basic flow, which calls no subprocess, and the four-phase pipeline they walk
 * is core's `l1-document-ingestion.bpmn` now. A harness test loading a core
 * diagram would be an upward reference.
