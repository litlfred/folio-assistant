/**
 * `merge-priority.dmn` against the vocabulary it answers in.
 *
 * `schemas/merge-queue.ts` has said since it was written that "a test asserts
 * the two agree". No such test existed. Measured 2026-10-04: `PRIORITY_CLASSES`
 * was referenced from nowhere but its own file, and the diagram's rule 3
 * returned a class — `ci-not-green` — that the enum did not contain, so the
 * first `placeAll` ever run against the live queue threw in `parse`.
 *
 * Both directions are asserted, because each catches a different defect and
 * neither implies the other: a class the table returns and the enum lacks
 * crashes the steward, while a class the enum lists and no rule returns is dead
 * vocabulary that a reader will take for a reachable state.
