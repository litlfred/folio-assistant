/**
 * No `maintains` claim may fall BETWEEN the two checks that reconcile them —
 * bean `6f1x`.
 *
 * Two checks answer "is this declared artefact really produced", and they
 * deliberately cover different artefacts:
 *
 * | check | covers | why not the rest |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `artefactDeclarationDrift` (`kg:schema:check`) | artefacts whose declaring Tool invokes `bun run kg:schema` | it cannot see whether the site build wrote a file into `_site/` |
 * | `checkMaintainedArtefacts` (`docs-site.yml`, post-assembly) | every claim, against a built tree | needs a built tree, so it cannot be a local gate |
 *
 * The narrowing that created this split was right — *"a check that answers a
 * question it cannot see is worse than one that declines to"* — and
 * `artefact-declaration-drift.test.ts` pins the decline: `ns/vocabulary.jsonld`
 * and `ns/content/v1.jsonld` must NOT be reported as drift.
 *
 * ## The hole those two suites leave, which is why this third one exists
 *
 * **"Correctly declined here" and "covered over there" were asserted in separate
 * files, and their conjunction was asserted nowhere.** So if the site check
 * narrowed, was renamed, or stopped iterating every Tool, the drift test would
 * still pass — it asserts an ABSENCE — and the artefacts it declines would be
 * covered by nothing at all, silently. The bean states the cost exactly:
 * *"'right to decline' is not 'covered'."*
 *
 * That is `covered-is-not-reachable` one level out: each instrument reports
 * success over its own scope, and nobody asks whether the scopes tile.
 *
 * These tests therefore assert the PARTITION rather than either side of it, and
 * every one of them is preceded by a non-vacuity check — a partition assertion
 * over an empty set is the emptiest possible pass.
 *
