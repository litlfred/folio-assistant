/**
 * A gate red for a NEW reason must not look like one red for the old reason.
 *
 * @module scripts/tests/gates-failure-summary
 *
 * Bean `ucb9`, and the cost was paid before it was filed. On 2026-09-20
 * `bun test` was red for one reason (a stale `__pycache__`, bean `koth`); six
 * new BPMN diagrams added a second (`no activity is silently skill-less`, 17
 * activities). `bun run gates` printed:
 *
 *     ✗ 2 of 55 failed:
 *       · bun test   (typescript / bun test)
 *
 * byte-identical before and after the second failure existed. It was read as
 * the known one and pushed. CI caught it.
 *
 * ## The bean's own diagnosis was wrong, and that is worth recording
 *
 * It said the summary "discards" the output. It does not — `gates.ts` ran
 * each gate with `stdio: "inherit"`, so everything WAS printed and simply
 * scrolled past. Nothing was captured, so the summary had nothing to quote.
 * The fix is a tee rather than "stop swallowing stdout", and the difference
 * matters: capturing with `spawnSync` and printing afterwards would also have
 * worked and would have traded a minute of live `bun test` output for the
 * recap, which is a regression, not a fix.
