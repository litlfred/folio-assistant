/**
 * Record a fixity digest for every materialized FILE that has none.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/backfill-materialized-fixity
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `check-materialized-fixity.ts` enforces that materialized content is not
 * edited in place, by hashing the bytes against the digest their record
 * carries. Measured 2026-09-22, the corpus held **229 materialized artefacts
 * and 6 verifiable digests** — so the gate was real and covered 2.6% of what
 * it is meant to protect. A green gate over that reads as "materialized
 * content is protected", which would have been false.
 *
 * The owner chose to close it: *"Backfill all 222 now."*
 *
 * ## WHAT A BACKFILLED DIGEST DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE
 *
 * This is the part that must not be lost. It is carried by `verifiedAt` on
 * each record — see the note on `VERIFIED_AT` for why that field rather than
 * prose — and stated in full here, in the commit, the PR and bean `10s1`.
 *
 * A digest computed today hashes **what is on disk today**. It establishes a
 * baseline from this moment forward: from here, an edit in place is caught.
 * It does **not** prove the bytes are pristine. If an artefact was already
 * edited before this ran, the backfill blesses that edit and nothing here can
 * tell.
 *
 * Egress is blocked in this environment, so re-fetching upstream to compare
 * was not available. That is a limit of the run, not of the idea — a later
 * run with network access could verify against `materialization.of` and
 * upgrade the claim from *observed* to *confirmed*.
 *
 * A machine-readable marker in the data rather than only a commit message is
 * deliberate: a commit message is read once, by whoever reviews it, and the
 * record is read every time somebody asks what the digest means.
 *
 * ## It backfills FILES only
 *
 * Three of the records without a digest are directories — who-iris's items
 * point at `library/<id>` while their bitstreams point at
 * `uploads/<id>/<file>`. A file digest does not apply to a directory, and
 * those items are already covered by their parts, which the checker reports as
 * its own verdict rather than as a gap. One more has no `localPath` at all.
 * Neither is backfilled, and neither is a failure.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/backfill-materialized-fixity.ts --dry-run
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/backfill-materialized-fixity.ts

/**
 * THE CAVEAT LIVES IN `verifiedAt`, NOT IN A PROSE FIELD — and that is a
 * correction, not the original design.
 *
 * The first version wrote a `note` onto each `fixity` explaining that a
 * backfilled digest is a baseline rather than proof. `FixitySchema` is
 * `.strict()` and permits `algorithm`, `digest` and `verifiedAt` only, so that
 * broke validation on both artefact indexes — caught by `bun run gates`, which
 * was still running when the change was pushed.
 *
 * The field that already exists says the load-bearing part precisely:
 * `verifiedAt` is *"when the digest was last RE-COMPUTED against the bytes,
 * not when it was recorded"*. A record whose ingestion never wrote a digest,
 * carrying a `verifiedAt` of the backfill date, IS the statement that this
 * digest was observed rather than original.
 *
 * The prose caveat is not repeated onto 217 records, where it would be 217
 * copies of one sentence. It lives in this module's header, the commit, the
 * PR and bean `10s1`. The owner chose a plain backfill over the option that
 * carried a distinguishing schema flag, so adding one here would be taking
 * back a decision rather than implementing it.
