/**
 * Which verify/write pairs a set of CHANGED PATHS can have affected — bean `94zs`.
 *
 * @module scripts/changed-paths
 * @graphNode none — a selection helper for `regen-after-merge.ts`
 *
 * ## What it answers
 *
 * *"Did anything this pair reads change?"* Two callers ask it:
 *
 * - `regen --changed <base>` asks it once, before the first pass, of the paths
 *   that differ between `<base>` and the merged tree. A pair none of whose
 *   inputs changed reads exactly what it read at `<base>`, so its answer there
 *   is its answer here.
 * - the fixpoint asks it before every later pass, of the paths the previous
 *   pass ACTUALLY changed — measured from the working tree before and after
 *   ({@link snapshotTree}), never taken from what a writer declares it writes.
 *
 * ## What a pair's footprint is
 *
 * The same set {@link fingerprint} hashes, so the two mechanisms cannot
 * disagree about what a pair reads:
 *
 * - its declared `inputs` and `outputs` globs (`task-io.ts`), matched against
 *   each changed path directly — so a file the change DELETED or CREATED is
 *   seen, which expanding the globs over the current tree alone would miss;
 * - the files those globs expand to now, and every directory above them — so a
 *   changed submodule gitlink (which `git diff` reports as one path) touches
 *   every declared file inside it;
 * - the script sources the pair runs, with their relative-import closure;
 * - `bun.lock`, and the `package.json` command line of every script the pair
 *   runs, following `bun run X` into X.
 *
 * ## Never skipped
 *
 * A pair is ALWAYS affected when it declares no inputs, when it declares
 * `{tracked}` and anything at all changed, or when its footprint cannot be
 * computed (a glob over nothing, a command that is not a script, a
 * non-literal dynamic import). Not knowing is never a reason to skip. And a
 * change set that could not be measured is `undefined`, which asks every pair.
