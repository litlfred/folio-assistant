/**
 * What a check script reads and writes (bean `xpcu`). This layer's rows are
 * declared here; an instance above it declares its own under `taskIo` in its
 * `<instance>.json`, and {@link collectTaskIo} reads both (bean `0r7u`).
 *
 * @module scripts/task-io
 * @graphNode none — a declaration table read by `regen-after-merge.ts` and `gates.ts`
 *
 * ## What a declaration buys
 *
 * - `outputs: []` — the script WRITES NOTHING. That is what lets `gates` run
 *   it in the worker pool beside other read-only gates, and lets `regen` ask
 *   it beside other read-only checks. A script with no `outputs` here runs
 *   alone, in order, exactly as it always did. (Only the empty list is used: a
 *   check that writes is treated as undeclared, and the test says so.)
 * - `inputs` — what can change the script's answer. This is what lets `regen`
 *   SKIP a verify/write pair whose inputs hash to the value recorded at its last
 *   green run, and `gates` skip the script itself when its inputs hash to its
 *   last pass (`input-hash.ts`, bean `f017`). `{tracked}` means the whole working tree as
 *   version control sees it; a narrower glob list hashes only what it names,
 *   plus the script's own source and every module it imports.
 *
 * ## The rule for adding one
 *
 * **`inputs: [TRACKED]` is a claim the fingerprint CHECKS, every time** (bean
 * `f017`, 2026-10-06). `input-sites.ts` walks the script's import closure, and
 * every line that can read something the tree does not hold — the environment,
 * the network, the clock, git history, a spawned process, a computed module —
 * must carry a pinned, reviewed `// input-site:` annotation saying what it
 * reads; otherwise the fingerprint is undetermined and the script RUNS. So a
 * `{tracked}` declaration can cost skips, never correctness, and the old rule
 * ("declare only what you have read") is enforced rather than remembered.
 * `bun run input-hash:coverage` says which declared scripts can skip and what
 * blocks the rest; `--sites <file>` prints the pins.
 *
 * - prefer `{tracked}` to a hand-picked glob list: a narrower list is a claim
 *   about FILES the audit cannot check, and a `tree` site refuses it;
 * - an `outputs: []` claim is re-checked on every `gates` run by the tree
 *   guard: a parallel batch that changes the tree is reported, naming the batch.
 *
 * ## How these entries were chosen — measured, 2026-10-01
 *
 * - `inputs`: the slowest pairs of a timed `bun run regen` (4 shared CPUs, load
 *   average 6–11 from other sessions; 1634 s, 2 passes). Each one's `--check`
 *   path was READ for writes, and its import closure scanned for environment,
 *   network and clock reads. Left out on purpose despite their cost:
 *   `uml:overview:check` (network and environment, via the PlantUML renderer),
 *   `kg:locale:check` and `translated-links:check` (environment),
 *   `library:viz:check`, `schema:viz:check` and `auto:docs:check` (network).
 * - `outputs: []` without `inputs`: every gate script that, run under
 *   `strace` on a clean tree, opened NOTHING for writing, created, renamed,
 *   removed or truncated nothing, inside or outside the repository (Bun's own
 *   cache aside). 185 of 193 gate scripts, measured 2026-10-01 — not inferred
 *   from a name.
 *
 * ## What the measurement cannot see, and why that is tolerable
 *
 * `strace` sees the code path a CLEAN tree takes. A check that writes only
 * when its answer changes is invisible to it: `skill:register:check` measured
 * read-only and writes its report whenever the verdict moves, so it is
 * declared by reading instead (skippable, not read-only). Another such check
 * left in the list fails in one direction only: in `gates`, its write is caught
 * by the tree guard and the run reports NOT clean, naming the parallel batch;
 * in `regen`, the settling pass re-asks every pair. A wrong `outputs: []` can
 * produce a false red, not a false green.
