#!/usr/bin/env bash
# rename-special-branch.sh — rename a special branch (or a family of them) on
# a GitHub repository, safely. Bean folio-assistant-32f6; the names are
# declared on the owning directory's `storage` (special-branches.json is gone).
#
# Needs nothing but git and push access. It does NOT use your checkout: it
# fetches into a throwaway bare repository in a temp directory, so it does not
# matter what you have cloned, fetched or switched to.
#
# Usage:
#   rename-special-branch.sh <owner/repo> <old> <new>            # dry run: shows the plan
#   rename-special-branch.sh <owner/repo> <old> <new> --apply    # does it
#
#   <old> ending in "/" renames a FAMILY: every branch starting with <old>
#   gets <old> replaced by <new>  (e.g. lake-cache/ cat/folio-assistant-sci/lake-cache/).
#
# Examples:
#   rename-special-branch.sh litlfred/folio-assistant state cat/cat-harness/state --apply
#   rename-special-branch.sh litlfred/smart-trust fhir-ast/ cat/fhir-harness/fhir-ast/ --apply
#
# Fail-safe, per branch, in this order — any failure stops before the next step:
#   1. the old branch is read and its commit (SHA) recorded;
#   2. if the new name already exists: same SHA -> only the old one is left to
#      remove; different SHA -> STOP, nothing is touched (someone wrote to it);
#   3. the new branch is created at exactly that SHA;
#   4. the new branch is read back from GitHub and must equal that SHA;
#   5. the old branch is deleted ONLY IF it still points at that SHA (a lease):
#      if anybody pushed to it in the meantime, the delete is refused and both
#      branches are kept for you to look at.
# Nothing is ever force-pushed. Re-running is safe: finished renames are skipped.
