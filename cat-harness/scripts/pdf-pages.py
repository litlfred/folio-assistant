"""Ingest a PDF to library/ at PAGE granularity — one section per page.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and when to reach for it instead of `pdf-structure.py`.

`pdf-structure.py` is the right tool whenever a PDF carries an embedded
outline: the structure is then READ rather than guessed, and the sections it
writes are the document's own chapters. Measured on
`uploads/9789241548960_eng.pdf` (WHO handbook for guideline development, 2nd
ed): 258 outline entries, 250 sections, real titles, real page ranges.

Without an outline it INFERS, and an inferred TOC can be confidently wrong in a
way the output does not show. Two measured failures, 2026-09-19, both in
`bean 6xaz`:

  * `uploads/WPR-RDO-2020-003-eng.pdf` — 11 of 13 inferred sections were named
    after a DIFFERENT publication, because page 22 is a sample table the style
    guide reproduces as a design example.
  * `uploads/WHO_PUB_TPS_93.1.pdf` — the inferred entries took their page
    numbers from the CONTENTS pages, so 26 of 42 sections came out under 500
    characters while 37 923 characters landed in one section misnamed
    `18-usetul-reference-books`.

In both, the text was present and the structure was fiction. This script is the
third state made usable: it does not claim to know the chapters, so it emits the
one division that cannot be wrong — the page. `section_title: "Page N"` is a
determined answer, `pages: N-N` is exact, and a rule derived from the document
can cite a node that really contains it.

It is NOT a replacement for sectioning. A page tree is worse to read and worse
to cite than a chapter tree; it is better than a chapter tree that lies. Once
`6xaz` is fixed, re-ingest with `pdf-structure.py` and delete the page tree.
