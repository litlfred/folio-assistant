/**
 * WHICH COPY a route-keyed generator's `--check` must compare against — the
 * checkout, the branch, or both — and why "neither" is a verdict rather than a
 * pass.
 *
 * @module scripts/route-authority
 * @graphNode none — a resolver, read by a generator's `--check`
 *
 * ## The question this exists to stop being hardcoded
 *
 * A generator's `--check` reads its own output off disk and compares. That is
 * right while `main` holds the output and wrong the moment a declaration says
 * the output lives on a branch — and `xsrv` Done-when 3 states the hard part:
 * *"a branch it cannot fetch reports unknown, never a pass."*
 *
 * So authority is RESOLVED, with three answers:
 *
 * | declaration | branch manifest | authority |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | no `storage` | — | `checkout` |
 * | `storage` | `authoritative: false` | `both` |
 * | `storage` | `authoritative: true` | `branch` |
 *
 * **`both` is the state that earns this module.** Between seeding a branch and
 * removing the files from `main` the same bytes exist in two places on purpose,
 * and nothing today compares them: `9ofm` added `not-cut-over` for a TIP-keyed
 * directory, and `offCheckoutFindings` skips `route`. During that window a
 * drift between the two copies is invisible, and it is exactly the window a
 * cutover spends its whole life in. So `both` compares both and reports a
 * disagreement.
 *
 * ## Why `unknown` is not `stale`, and never `current`
 *
 * A branch that cannot be fetched is a question nobody answered. Calling it
 * stale sends the next hour to the generator; calling it current is the
 * vacuous pass this repository has paid for repeatedly (`1xhc`, `xom7`). The
 * caller is expected to exit non-zero on `unknown` AND to say it could not
 * determine — which is a different sentence from "stale".
 *
 * ## Nothing is flipped by adopting this
 *
 * No declaration in this repository sets `storage`, so every caller resolves
 * `checkout` and the comparison is the one it already did. That is asserted
 * rather than asserted-in-prose: `route-authority.test.ts` pins that the
 * `checkout` verdict over a given file map equals the direct on-disk
 * comparison, file for file.
