 * The Pages deployments, and the publish-branch commits that triggered them.

 * every one.** The deployments run on the PUBLISH branch rather than the
 * default one; they are raised by `github-pages[bot]` on the `dynamic` event,
 * so there is no file in `.github/workflows/` for `knownWorkflows` to make a
 * row out of; and `?branch=<default>` excludes them outright. Measured
 * 2026-09-20: the default-branch page held **zero** of them while the publish
 * branch held **52 cancelled and 48 succeeded**.
 *
 * ## Why the workflow is discovered rather than named
 *
 * GitHub's Pages workflow has no file, so it is addressed by id — and the id
 * is per-repository. Two alternatives were tried and rejected by measurement:
 * `GET /repos/{slug}/pages` says the publish branch outright and answers
 * **403 without admin**, and the `dynamic/pages/pages-build-deployment` path
 * answers **404** through the by-path runs endpoint. So the workflow list is
 * read once and the entry is found by its `dynamic/pages/` path prefix.
 *
 * That also removes the last assumption: the publish branch is read off the
 * runs' own `head_branch`, so a repository publishing from `main` or from a
 * `docs/` folder reports its branch rather than a hardcoded `gh-pages`.
 *
 * Costs two requests, and a third for the commits. A repository with no Pages
 * spends one and stops.
