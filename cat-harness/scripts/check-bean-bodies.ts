/**
 * Three store defects `beans check` cannot see, because none of them is a link.
 *
 * Bean `sfhr`, measured 2026-09-20 with `beans check` reporting *"No link
 * issues found"* over the same store:
 *
 * 1. **`70c7`** — `in-progress` with an **empty body**. Front matter only. A
 *    claimed item that says nothing about what it is, which is the one thing a
 *    sibling reading the store needs.
 * 2. **`52dz`** — `title: |-` continued into the body and swallowed the first
 *    ~10 lines, including a `## Done when` with three unchecked boxes. It read
 *    as a bean with no acceptance criteria; it had three.
 * 3. **`nvbr`** — *"blocked on bean `fsch`"* in prose. `fsch` is `scrapped`.
 *    The block can never lift, and nothing said so.
 *
 * ## Why prose, when front-matter links are already checked
 *
 * Because that is where blockers are actually written. `beans` has no blocker
 * field, so [`bean-blocking.md`](../skills/folio-core/bean-blocking.md) puts
 * them in the body — and the CLI's link check covers front matter. The one
 * place the convention puts the fact is the one place nothing read.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT do
 *
 * **It does not repair anything.** `sfhr`'s own Done-when says the three beans
 * above are repaired *by their owners* and that the bean does not edit them.
 * Same rule as `bun run health`: four of its five checks are about artefacts
 * accumulating and every finding names something a person does.
 *
 * **It ignores closed beans**, like `check:bean-parents` and for the same
 * reason: a finished bean is history, and back-filling it changes no plan.
 * A `## Done when` is not required either — plenty of good beans are a
 * paragraph — the requirement is that the body EXISTS.
 *
 * Exit: 0 clean (or no store), 1 a real defect, 2 could not check.

/**
 * A blocker written the way the corpus actually writes one:
 * **`Blocked on bean \`fsch\``**, **`Blocked on \`folio-assistant-68dt\``**.
 *
 * Two constraints, and both were added after MEASURING the looser form against
 * the store. A bare word is not a reference — permitting one matched *"not
 * blocked on anything but the question"*, *"blocked on there being a
 * dataset"*, *"blocked on effort"* and four more, none of them a bean. So the
 * id must be **in a code span** and must be **id-shaped**: the store's
 * `id_length` is 4, with the instance prefix optional.
 *
 * ## The `not` escape is LINE-SCOPED, and a wrap defeats it
 *
 * The caller scans `body.split("\n")` one line at a time, so `\s+` in the
 * `not` group can never span a newline. A withdrawal written as
 *
 * ```md
 * ... and as of 2026-09-22 each is **not
 * blocked on `68dt`** because it completed.
 * ```
 *
 * reads correctly to a person and is reported as a live block, because the
 * line the checker sees begins at `blocked on`. Hit while withdrawing the six
 * dead blockers on 2026-09-22 — the fix is to keep `not blocked on \`id\``
 * on ONE line, not to widen the pattern: making it multi-line would also let
 * a `not` three paragraphs up silence a real assertion.
 *
 * The same scoping is why {@link insideQuotation} takes a line rather than
 * the body, and it is deliberate there for the identical reason.

/**
 * Is the match inside a quotation on its own line?
 *
 * **A quotation is not an assertion**, and the distinction is not academic:
 * `sfhr` — the bean this check was written for — contains the sentence
 * *"`nvbr` is \"blocked on bean `fsch`\", which is `scrapped`"*. Reporting
 * that as `sfhr`'s own dead blocker would make the check's first finding a
 * misreading of its own specification.
 *
 * Counted rather than pattern-matched: an odd number of unescaped `"` before
 * the match on that line means the match sits inside one.
 *
 * ## SCOPE: the quote mark is the whole signal, and a TABLE CELL is not one
 *
 * `k59d` asked whether this should also read a markdown table cell — *"the
 * guard covers a markdown table cell, or the guard's stated scope says it
 * does not and why — a workaround in one bean is not a fix"*. It does not,
 * and the corpus is what settles it rather than taste.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-21 over every bean body, for `blocked on \`id\`` on a line
 * beginning `|`. **Two occurrences, and they point opposite ways:**
 *
 * | bean | the cell | what it is |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `k59d` | `"blocked on \`hqku\`, …"` | yg29's sentence, quoted — already marked, already skipped |
 * | `xgd8` | `blocked on \`slw1\`, see above` | **its own** blocker, asserted in a cell. `slw1` is `todo`, so the block is live |
 *
 * So the only unquoted cell in the store is a genuine self-assertion that
 * must keep being read. **Treating a cell as a quotation would silently
 * exempt exactly it** — and every future one, since a table is where a bean
 * naturally states structured facts about itself.
 *
 * That also means `k59d`'s double-quoting was never a workaround. Quoting
 * text you are quoting is correct English and is precisely the signal this
 * function reads; the finding message below says so, on the one line shape
 * where an author is most likely to leave it off.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT read, and why nothing was built for it
 *
 * A **blockquote** (`> blocked on \`x\``) is unambiguously a quotation in
 * markdown and would be a defensible extension. The store contains **zero**
 * of them, measured the same way, so implementing it would be building for a
 * case that does not exist. Emphasis (`*…*`) is not attribution at all and is
 * not a candidate. If a blockquote form appears later, this is the paragraph
 * that says the gap was known and priced rather than missed.
