/**
 * `bun run tools:remedy <host | URL | error text>` — what to reach for when a
 * network host refuses you.
 *
 * Bean `6mk7`: on 2026-10-06 packages.fhir.org was refused, and the agent
 * concluded SUSHI could not run, while `fhir-cache-seed-npm` sat in the Tool
 * graph for exactly that refusal. Nothing led from the symptom to the Tool.
 * This reads every declared Tool's `remedies` (schemas/tool.ts,
 * `ToolRemedySchema`) and answers from them, so the answer is the graph's,
 * not a list kept here.
 *
 * Exit 0 when at least one remedy matched (a Tool, or a stated `none`), 1 when
 * nothing declared matches — which is itself worth reporting: that host is
 * reached by no declared Tool, or the Tool reaching it is undeclared.
 *
 * @graphNode script
