/**
 * Actor reach — is every declaration consistent with the site it runs in, and
 * does anything declare it at all?
 *
 * Bean `folio-assistant-r0rq`. `reach` is what the signing gateway branches
 * on, so two failure modes matter and they are not the same:
 *
 * 1. **A conflict** — an actor claiming more reach than its deployment
 *    declares. That is a declaration error and fails the check.
 * 2. **Nothing declared** — the third state. It does NOT fail: undeclared
 *    reach resolves to `unknown`, `unknown` routes to the human signer, and
 *    that is a correct, safe outcome. But it is REPORTED, because a repo
 *    where nothing declares reach gets the human route every time, and a
 *    tick that hid that would be the vacuity failure this repository has
 *    paid for three times.
 *
 * `--require-declaration` turns state 2 into a failure, for a deployment that
 * means to exercise the API route and wants to be told it never will.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant/scripts/check-actor-reach
 * @covers scenarios
