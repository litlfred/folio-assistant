/**
 * Path classes for the merge pipeline: which changed paths are GENERATED,
 * which are generated REGIONS inside authored files, and which are AUTHORED,
 * plus the shared declarations two otherwise independent PRs can collide on
 * (bean `blgm`).
 *
 * @module scripts/merge-pipeline-paths
 * @graphNode none — a classifier, read by `merge-train.ts`, `merge-overlap.ts` and `merge-leftover.ts`
 *
 * ## Generated is read from the declaration, never listed here
 *
 * The generated paths are the ones `merge-conflict-patterns.ts` declares a
 * resolving strategy for: `take-base` and `qa-sidecar` are wholly generated,
 * and `generated-regions` is authored prose with generator-owned regions.
 * Everything else, including a path no pattern names, is AUTHORED. A second
 * list here would be a second answer to "what is generated", free to drift
 * from the one `merge:main` acts on. Requirement R7 in
 * `docs/proposals/merge-pipeline-requirements.md`: a conflict test that
 * counted generated paths would predict every pair as conflicting and say
 * nothing.
 *
 * ## Shared declarations ARE listed here, with reasons
 *
 * Nothing else in the repository declares "a file many PRs edit and whose
 * concurrent edits interact": that is the T3 rule, and this table is its one
 * home. Each entry says why it is shared.
