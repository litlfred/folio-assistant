/**
 * A bean and its issue reach each other — in BOTH directions, where that is
 * checkable from a checkout.
 *
 * Bean `oh78`, measured 2026-09-20: 54 proposals merged in one four-hour
 * window and **2 issues changed**, both newly opened. Issue #558 (*"Sticky pin:
 * unpinning loses the theme"*) carries no bean link although `ivfw` is its
 * subject verbatim; #464 is open on a `completed` bean.
 *
 * ## One direction is a real check; the other is honestly undetermined
 *
 * | direction | source | verdict |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | bean → issue | the bean's own body | **checked** — every reference is extracted and listed |
 * | issue → bean, for a TRACKED issue | `issue-marks/` | **checked** — a tracked issue no open bean names is a finding |
 * | issue → bean, in general | GitHub | **could not determine** — needs the API, and a checkout is not it |
 *
 * The third row is the one that must not be quietly dropped. A check that
 * reported the first two as a clean bill of health would be asserting
 * something about every issue in the repository on the evidence of two files.
 * So the third state is printed every run, named, with what would settle it —
 * the rule `could-not-determine-is-a-third-state-everywhere` already states
 * for this repository, applied to its own coverage rather than to its inputs.
 *
 * `issue-marks/` is the right offline source for row two precisely because of
 * what it is: an id and two timestamps for an issue some session decided was
 * worth tracking. An issue in there is one the work plan has already engaged
 * with, so "no bean names it" is a defect rather than an absence.
 *
 * Exit: 0 clean or nothing to check, 1 a tracked issue no bean names, 2 unknown.
