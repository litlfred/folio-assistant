/**
 * An ingested upload does not stay in the queue. Bean `q7ey`.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/check-uploads-retired
 *
 * Both graphs, because the finding is a RELATION between them — a queue file
 * whose bytes some library entry derived from — and a declaration naming one
 * would credit half the audit to nothing.
 *
 * @covers uploads
 * @covers library
 *
 * ## The rule, in the owner's words
 *
 * 2026-09-29, answering *"why are ingested things still sitting in uploads and
 * not moived to library of appropraite harness?"*:
 *
 * > no, uploads is archival copy.
 *
 * then, refining where the archival copy belongs:
 *
 * > archival (once ingested into KG and put into a proper `library/` under a
 * > harness repo) then it should be moved to fsh-guts.
 *
 * So there are three stages and `uploads/` is the only temporary one: **queued**
 * in a declared `uploads/`, **derived** into `library/<slug>/`, **archived** in
 * `fsh-guts/uploads/` with a same-basename sidecar. The reasoning is in
 * `skills/library/library-core/library-ingestion.md`.
 *
 * ## Why a check and not a sweep
 *
 * The rule was written on 2026-09-30 and swept by hand the same day. Within
 * that one commit the sweep produced **three** wrong answers, each invisible
 * from its own output:
 *
 *   - it reported **nine** sources to retire, having resolved
 *     `cat-harness/library/` alone. The answer was 28 across five harnesses.
 *   - it reported **five sources RESTORED** from `4b10661cdde` "after an
 *     earlier session deleted them". None had been deleted. All five were at
 *     `cat-harness/uploads/` continuously, and are there at HEAD; the sweep
 *     `git show`-ed a second copy of each into the archive. It believed them
 *     deleted because it looked for them in `uploads/`, where they were
 *     genuinely absent — they had been RENAMED into `cat-harness/uploads/`.
 *   - three more it processed from the right directory and copied rather than
 *     moved, leaving the original in place.
 *
 * Eight files in two places, and a recovery claim with nothing recovered.
 * Correcting the count did not correct the method that produced it, which is
 * the whole argument for this file: **a rule nothing checks is a rule that
 * holds until the next session, and this one did not survive its own commit.**
 *
 * `milnorlink.pdf` is the fourth case and the cleanest statement of it: it was
 * ingested to `folio-assistant-sci/library/`, so a sweep matching against
 * `cat-harness/library/` saw no match and read it as still queued. The finding
 * is not "somebody was careless"; it is that a one-directory answer looks
 * exactly like a whole one.
 *
 * ## What it compares, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * A queue file is RETIRED when its sha256 equals the `source_sha256` recorded
 * by some library entry's manifest. Hashes rather than filenames, because a
 * rename is the normal case — `2509.06388v1.pdf` is archived as
 * `wang-rangaiah-2026-mcdm-aggregation.pdf`, and a name comparison would have
 * called that unarchived and produced a ninth duplicate.
 *
 * It does not judge whether a queued file OUGHT to be ingested. A PDF nobody
 * has read is a legitimate queue item and reports as `queued`. The finding is
 * only ever the pair: derived AND still in the queue.
 *
 * It reports rather than deletes. `deletion-requires-confirmation`: the remedy
 * names a `git mv`, or a `git rm` when the identical bytes are already in the
 * archive, and a person runs it.
