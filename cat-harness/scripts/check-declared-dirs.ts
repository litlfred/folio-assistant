/**
 * Every declared directory exists, or says why it does not.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-declared-dirs
 * @covers cat-harness
 *
 * ## The gap, and why no existing check could have found it
 *
 * `resolveDirectories` is **existence-filtered**. A declared directory that is
 * not on disk is dropped before any consumer sees it — which is right for a
 * consumer (scanning a path that is not there is not useful) and is precisely
 * why nothing ever reported one. A declaration asserts *this directory is
 * ours*; when that is false, every consumer reports a clean run over nothing.
 * The `dh4f` shape, inside the resolver they all depend on. Bean `8mbk`.
 *
 * The neighbouring checks each answer a different question and none answers
 * this one: `check:declared-assets` verifies declared FILES and their links,
 * `check:declared-paths` refuses a literal naming a declared directory, and
 * `check:declaration-claims` compares prose against the files. A directory
 * declared into thin air passes all three.
 *
 * ## Two directions, and the second is the one that rots quietly
 *
 * - **absent, unexplained** — declared and not on disk, with no `absent`
 *   reason. A finding.
 * - **explained, but present** — declares `absent` and the directory exists.
 *   Also a finding: an exemption that outlived its cause reads as a live
 *   decision and is not one. Nothing goes wrong when this rots, which is
 *   exactly why it needs a checker rather than a reader.
 *
 * Checking only the first direction would let the escape hatch become
 * permanent the moment somebody created the directory, and the declaration
 * would go on claiming a deliberate absence forever.
 *
 * ## Where a path resolves against
 *
 * `scope: "repository"` resolves against the REPOSITORY root; anything else
 * against the declaring INSTANCE's root — the rule `KgAssetSchema.src`
 * already states for assets. Getting this backwards is not a subtle bug: a
 * first measurement for `8mbk` joined other instances' repo-scoped paths onto
 * the instance root and reported **ten** phantom absences out of 35. Every one
 * was the checker's error.
 *
 * ## Instances are DISCOVERED, not listed
 *
 * Via {@link instanceRootsIn}, the same way `check:declared-assets` does, and
 * for the reason recorded there: that gate twice reported a clean run over
 * instances a hardcoded list had never heard of.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 clean · 1 any finding.
