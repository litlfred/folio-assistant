/**
 * A voice skill's instruction body must not RESTATE its own rules.
 *
 * @module scripts/check-voice-skills
 * @covers voices, skills
 * @graphNode none — a checker over the voices graph
 *
 * ## The promise this makes good on
 *
 * `schemas/voice-skill.ts` has said, since the day it was written:
 *
 * > **No field serves two of those by restatement.** The instruction body must
 * > not enumerate rules … `check:voice-skills` enforces it.
 *
 * **It did not exist.** Bean `n8br`. Four `SKILL.md` files repeat the claim in
 * their own prose, so the promise was made in five places and kept in none.
 *
 * That is worse than an unstated rule in one specific way: an absent gate
 * nobody was told about leaves a reviewer reading carefully, while an absent
 * gate a doc comment promises leaves them reading PAST. The same shape as a
 * stale `AGENTS.md` entry, which this repository has paid for repeatedly.
 *
 * ## What restatement IS, and the four ways it gets in
 *
 * A rule lives in `voice.json` with the page and the quote it was read from,
 * and with the patterns a checker runs. Copied into `SKILL.md` as prose it
 * arrives with **neither** — an uncited assertion beside a cited one, free to
 * drift, and the uncited copy is the one a drafter reads first.
 *
 * So four signals, one per way a rule leaks across:
 *
 * | signal | what it catches |
 * |---|---|
 * | the rule's **id** | a body that indexes or lists the rules |
 * | the rule's **title** | the commonest copy — a heading per rule |
 * | the citation's **quote** | the source passage moved into the prose |
 * | a **terminology pair**, both sides | "write X, never Y" lifted out of the data |
 *
 * ## Why this can be mechanical at all
 *
 * Because the two halves are not written in the same register. A rule title is
 * a specific editorial claim — *"-ize, not -ise"*, *"Roman numerals for the
 * front matter, Arabic for the body"* — and instructions are about what an
 * actor DOES. Measured 2026-09-21 over the four voices this repository ships,
 * 37 rules: **zero hits on any of the four signals**. A check that fires on
 * every one of its subjects is a check that is wrong, and so is one that can
 * never fire — the falsification below is what separates them.
 *
 * ## The structural half
 *
 * A voice declaring `$schema: "folio-voice-skill/v1"` promises an
 * `instructions.file`. That the file RESOLVES is checkable and Zod cannot
 * check it, which is the same gap `check:declared-assets` fills one level up.
 *
 * **A voice that promises NOTHING is not missing anything.** A bare
 * `folio-voice/v1` profile may carry no instruction body at all — its guidance
 * may be a separate skill it cites — and `voiceFilesIn` reads that layout
 * deliberately. This check asked every voice for a `SKILL.md` until
 * 2026-09-21, which made a legitimate shape CRITICAL.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run check:voice-skills
