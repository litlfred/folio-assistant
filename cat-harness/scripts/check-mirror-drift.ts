/**
 * Mirror-drift audit — a content-block `.lean` sibling that restates a library
 * declaration must not disagree with it.
 *
 * ## The defect this catches
 *
 * Content-block `.lean` siblings compile standalone and cannot import one
 * another, so a sibling that needs a library type **restates it**: same
 * `structure`/`class`, same name, same namespace, fields copied across. That
 * is deliberate and mostly harmless.
 *
 * It stops being harmless when the two copies drift, because a co-located
 * `<block>.lean` wins **candidate 1** of `lean.ref` resolution
 * (`resolveCanonicalLean` / `walkBlocks` in `content/pipeline/qa-utils.ts`),
 * unconditionally and before any Lake-tree candidate. Every checker aimed at
 * that block then audits the sibling's copy and never sees the declaration
 * `lake build` actually compiles. A file can be green, compile clean, satisfy
 * every gate — and be the wrong definition.
 *
 * Measured on `litlfred/qou@main` 2026-08-23 (bean `qou-u87j`): 147 same-FQN
 * pairs, 94 faithful, **46 drifted across 39 files, and all 46 mask a block's
 * `lean.ref`** — plus **7 `regime` pairs** that the field comparison alone
 * calls faithful, and **10** of the 46 that cross the wall as well.
 * Worked example — `QOU.CRManifoldData`: the library copy carries
 * `n_pos : 0 < n` and the siblings do not; the siblings carry `contact_nondeg`
 * and `reeb_preserves_contact` and the library does not. Each side has an
 * anti-vacuity condition the other lacks.
 *
 * ## What counts as drift
 *
 * Same fully-qualified name (namespace + declaration name) declared both under
 * a package's Lake root and in a co-located sibling, where the two disagree on
 * either the `extends` list or the declared field names. Field types are not
 * part of *that* comparison — a rename or a re-ordering is drift, a whitespace
 * change is not.
 *
 * Two findings are reported separately rather than as drift, because they are
 * different problems:
 *
 *   - `regime` — the pair agrees on every field name and parent and still sits
 *     on **opposite sides of the §7c substrate→archimedean wall**, judged by
 *     the corpus's own `ARCHIMEDEAN_TYPE_RE` applied to the field *types*. The
 *     name comparison scores these as faithful mirrors; on qou that hid **7**
 *     of them. Kept out of the drift count on purpose: the fix is a wall split,
 *     not a field resync, and a §7c figure should not move when someone drains
 *     the drift backlog. Drifted pairs that *also* cross the wall are counted
 *     under `driftedRegime` and flagged in place.
 *   - `duplicate-in-library` — one fully-qualified name declared more than once
 *     inside the Lake tree. Nothing to mirror against; fix that first.
 *
 * The `regime` check exists because the wall gates cannot see this. Bean
 * `qou-6ome`: `check-wall-side` and `check-base-ring` fire on a file that
 * *mixes* regimes, so a declaration **wholly** on the wrong side passes both.
 * Passing the wall gate means "not mixed", not "on the right side of the wall".
 * Comparing a declaration against its own mirror is the cheapest way to see it.
 *
 * ## Gating
 *
 * Reports everything and exits 0 by default: a new gate that fails CI on a
 * pre-existing backlog just trains people to pass `--warn-only`. Freeze the
 * current count with `--baseline <N>` and the gate fires only on growth, which
 * is what keeps the faithful mirrors from becoming the next batch of drifted
 * ones.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  — under all gates, or `--warn-only`.
 *   2  — drifted-pair count exceeds `--max <N>`.
 *   3  — drifted-pair count exceeds `--baseline <N>` (growth gate).
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *   bun run scripts/check-mirror-drift.ts                  # summary to stdout
 *   bun run scripts/check-mirror-drift.ts --json           # machine-readable
 *   bun run scripts/check-mirror-drift.ts --tsv drift.tsv  # one row per pair
 *   bun run scripts/check-mirror-drift.ts --baseline 50    # fail only on growth
 *   bun run scripts/check-mirror-drift.ts --max 0          # fail on any drift
 *   bun run scripts/check-mirror-drift.ts --package qou    # one package only
 *
 * ## Parser limits — read these before quoting a number
 *
 * Regex, not Lean. It reads a `structure`/`class` head, then indented
 * `field :` lines until the first dedent, tracking `namespace`/`section` as a
 * stack. Consequences:
 *
 *   - A field whose type spans lines before its `:` is missed.
 *   - A `where`-clause default on its own line is not counted as a field.
 *   - A head binder written `[inst : Foo]` on its own line is indistinguishable
 *     from an instance-implicit field at the textual level, so it is counted as
 *     a field. Both sides are parsed identically, so a drift verdict stays
 *     sound; a field *list* printed in a finding may include one binder.
 *   - Name + namespace collision is treated as "same declaration". Two
 *     genuinely unrelated declarations sharing a fully-qualified name would be
 *     reported as drift — which is a defect deserving the same attention.
 *
 * The faithful-mirror count is the control: a parser mis-reading fields at
 * random could not produce a high exact-match rate. `--json` reports
 * `identical` alongside `drifted` so the ratio stays visible, and the summary
 * prints it. If that ratio collapses, suspect the parser before the corpus.
 *
 * `scripts/tests/check-mirror-drift.test.ts` pins the mistakes earlier versions
 * of this parser made — named and anonymous sections corrupting the namespace
 * stack, docstring prose read as fields, `extends` unparsed or dropped when
 * wrapped, a lowercase-only field pattern dropping `M : Type*`, and splitting
 * an `extends` clause on commas *before* stripping `.{u, v}` (which tears
 * `B.{u, v} R` into two entries and reports every explicitly-universed mirror
 * as drift). Every one of them moved a count.
