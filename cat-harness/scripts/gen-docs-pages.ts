/**
 * Emit `docs/<slug>.md` from a `content/docs/<slug>/<slug>.ts` webpage manifest.
 *
 * This is the missing code path. Every existing renderer targets LaTeX
 * (`render-latex.ts`), one assembled Markdown file (`render-markdown.ts`), or
 * the viewer — nothing has ever emitted into the Jekyll site from content. The
 * shape here is deliberately copied from `gen-skill-docs.ts`, which has been
 * emitting 107 pages into `docs/reference/skill-instructions/` for months:
 * derive the front matter, wrap the body, write, and gate on `--check` so the
 * generated copy cannot drift from its source.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BUYS OVER A HAND-WRITTEN PAGE, concretely:
 *
 *   1. Anchors stop depending on heading text. `heading_anchors: true` derives
 *      `#extract-structure` from the words in the heading, so a retitle
 *      silently breaks every inbound link — including the subprocess links
 *      `render-bpmn.ts` derives from a node's `asset.source`
 *      (`process-presentations.ts`). Each node's `id` is pinned with
 *      kramdown's `{: #id }` instead.
 *   2. Every node gets an edit link to ITS OWN source. Jekyll knows only
 *      `page.path`, so a per-node link is impossible from the theme: the
 *      node -> file mapping exists only here, in the thing that assembles the
 *      page. That is the whole argument for generating the page at all.
 *   3. An asset's edit link points at the `.bpmn`, never at the generated
 *      `.svg`. `render-bpmn.ts` is explicit that the SVGs are never
 *      hand-edited; a link inviting someone to do so would be worse than none.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/gen-docs-pages.ts            # write
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/gen-docs-pages.ts --check    # fail if any page is stale
 *
 * @covers docs

 * ## Why "not swept" moved out of the page
 *
 * It was server-rendered, as an inert `<span>`, on the argument that whether a

 * embedded it went stale on every checkout that had not fetched: with
 * `test/results/` absent `--check` read all 17 generated pages as stale
 * (`docs:pages:check`, `check:ci-invocations`).
 *
 * So the page carries one uniform placeholder per (subject, family), and the
 * per-page `qa-index.json` — its own small JSON asset, generated beside the
 * projections at site-build time and fetched by `paintQaBadges` — says which
 * of four things each one is:

 *   - `corpus: "absent"`: the results were not fetched for this build, so
 *     whether it was swept is unknown — "not available in this build";
 *   - the index would not load, or has no row: could not determine.
 *
 * "Not swept" and "could not determine" stay distinct facts; they are decided
 * one file over now. (An absent simulators directory rendered as "this folio
 * has no simulators" is the collapse this repository has paid for.)

 * are not published. The index is a few KB and one request; the projection is

 * The page-level `TR` badge — one panel for every translation verdict on the

 *
 * The per-node `TR` icon is honest and almost always empty: a block gets a
 * translation sidecar only when a PO actually carries its strings, and this
 * site is 3% translated, so 114 of 115 of those icons are "not swept" with
 * nothing under them. A reader of a translated page had no translation
 * evidence to open anywhere on it. The page-level round-trip badge that once
 * stood in that spot was deleted (bean `ktt2`) because it scored 36 strings
 * against a 6-entry back-translation map and published every unmeasured one as
 * drift — right to remove, and nothing replaced it. Issue #687, bean `r3ez`.
 *
 * ## It is the SAME control as every other badge, deliberately
 *
 * Same placeholder, same `data-qa-*` contract, same `qa-index.json`, painted
 * by the same `paintQaBadges` and opened by the same `qaToggle`. The only new
 * fact is the subject, which is a page rather than a node, and
 * `rollUpWitnessDocs` labels every criterion with the block it came from so
 * the panel still says which one a failure belongs to.
 *
 * No roll-up at all is `unswept` in the index — nothing to open — and, as for
 * every other badge since bean `4l4d`, that is the index's answer rather than
 * the page's.
 *
 * The badge rides a `fa-page-qa-badges` paragraph under the `h1`;
 * `mountTranslationBadges` in `docs-ui.js` hoists it into the coverage/sweep
 * row so the page carries one badge row rather than two.

/**
 * What `--check` gates, and what it merely reports.
 *
 * Three kinds, because two would put a live measurement behind a red X:
 *
 *   - **`page`** — a `docs/*.md`. Gated on exact content. Everything it now
 *     carries is structure, so a difference is somebody who added a node,
 *     renamed a block, ran a first sweep, or moved a sidecar, and did not
 *     regenerate. That is a real omission and a reviewer reads the page in the
 *     diff, so it must not drift.
 *   - **`data`** — `assets/todos/index.json`, likewise a projection of files a
 *     human authored. Gated on exact content for the same reason.
 *   - **`verdict`** — a witness projection or a page's verdict index. Gated on
 *     EXISTENCE only. Its contents are a function of the QA sidecars AND of
 *     the working tree (`readWitnessDoc` recomputes `freshness` by hashing the
 *     live subject), so it moves whenever a sweep re-runs or a block is
 *     edited — neither of which anybody forgot to do. A missing file IS an
 *     omission: the badge would point at a 404 forever.
 *
 * **Not gating the contents costs the reader nothing, and that is checkable
 * rather than argued.** `docs-site.yml` and `feature-staging.yml` both run
 * this generator in full before copying `test/results/witnesses/` into
 * `_site/assets/qa/`, so the projections a reader actually fetches are
 * regenerated at publish. The committed copies are a cache for local work and
 * for review; gating them could only ever fire on a graph that changed, which
 * is precisely what bean `d2kp` exists to stop the gate doing.

 * The `qa` graph, projected as one panel per family — bean `py74`, issue #635.

 * from `declared` to `live` the moment `assets/<id>/index.json` exists, so
 * this file is the whole of what was missing — no generator, schema or route
 * change.
 *
 * **The directory comes from the DECLARATION, not from a literal.** `qa` is
 * declared once, at `test/results/`, and `directoryForGraph` throws rather
 * than picking silently if that ever stops being true — the `wggr` failure,
 * where resolving `cat-harness` to the first of several matches wrote 37
 * sidecars against the wrong subjects on a run that exited 0. The neighbouring
 * `QA_ASSET_DIR` above still composes its path by hand; it is not changed here
 * because it names a SUBDIRECTORY of the graph (`witnesses/`) that no
 * declaration distinguishes, which is a different question and another bean's.
 *
 * Existence-gated, like the bean index and for the same reason: every QA
 * sweep rewrites this graph, so the projection moves whenever anybody runs
 * one. A content gate would go red on a projection that is fresh on the branch
 * and fresh on main and stale only against their union — bean `d2kp`.

/**
 * Publish a translation projection for every HAND-AUTHORED docs page that has

 * ## Why this loop exists beside the generated-page loop above
 *
 * A generated page's translation verdicts live on its BLOCKS, and `pageQaIcons`
 * rolls those up. A hand-authored page has no blocks; `translation-block-qa.ts`
 * measures the page itself, one sidecar per locale. Those are the pages this
 * site actually has translations of — `docs/index.md` in all five target
 * locales — and nothing published their verdicts. Bean `pp93`.
 *
 * ## It emits from HERE rather than from its own script, and that is forced
 *
 * The orphan sweep immediately below deletes everything under `QA_ASSET_DIR`
 * that this run did not emit. A second writer into that tree would have its
 * files removed by the next `gen-docs-pages` run — silently, since a projection
 * nobody links to is a projection nobody notices is gone. One writer, one
 * prune.
 *
 * ## The page slug is the page's PATH, not its basename
 *
 * `docs/index.md` and `docs/cat-harness/index.md` are different pages with the
 * same stem. `assets/qa/<slug>/` keyed on the basename would give them one
 * directory and one of the two would overwrite the other — the same collision
 * the PO resolution in `translation-block-qa.ts` just had to be taught to
 * refuse, one layer down.
 *
 * That pair went away on 2026-09-21 (bean `8h42`, and the generated page that
 * took the route is `published-graphs.md`, not a second `index.md`). The rule
 * stays: it is about stems, not about those two files, and the next pair to
 * share one will not announce itself.
