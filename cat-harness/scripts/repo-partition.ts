/**
 * Repo partition — Phase 0.2 of the separation-of-concerns migration (#223).
 *
 * Replaces the filename heuristic in `docs/architecture/current-state.md` with
 * a real import-graph partition. Answers two questions:
 *
 *   1. Which modules would land in each of the five proposed repositories?
 *   2. Which import edges cross a proposed boundary IN THE WRONG DIRECTION?
 *
 * Question 2 is the point. That cross-edge list is Phase I's worklist: every
 * entry is a module that must move, a dependency that must invert, or a
 * documented exception.
 *
 * ## BOTH QUESTIONS ARE ASKED WITHIN ONE INSTANCE
 *
 * `ROOT` is this instance, and `SCAN_ROOTS` are relative to it, so question 2
 * is "which edges cross a proposed boundary **among this instance's own
 * modules**". It is silent about imports between instances that already exist
 * side by side in the checkout. Bean `p11x`; the report says so in its own
 * output, because a bare "0 wrong-direction edges" was cited as the wide claim
 * on #1465 and had to be corrected by comment.
 *
 * The cross-instance axis belongs to `kg:detangle:direction`, where a node's
 * layer is the instance it lives in — the owner's Option 2 ruling of
 * 2026-09-30. It is blocking in CI. The two are not each other's second
 * opinion: this one partitions a future layout by path rule, that one checks
 * a present layout against declared `needs`, and Phase I.1 needs both.
 *
 * ## Three states, not two
 *
 * A module this tool cannot classify is reported as `unassigned`, never
 * silently bucketed into core. Same discipline as `readme-sections.ts`: "could
 * not determine" is a distinct answer from "determined to be core", and
 * collapsing the two is how a wrong partition looks like a clean one.
 *
 * Every assignment carries its provenance:
 *
 *   - `rule`    — an explicit path rule. Trustworthy.
 *   - `triage`  — a per-file judgement someone made by hand, by the bean
 *                 `dh4f` question: does this read or write PLATFORM, or
 *                 CONTENT? Recorded separately from `rule` so a decision
 *                 stays visible as a decision, and can be revisited without
 *                 first working out which entries were judgements.
 *   - `keyword` — a domain keyword in the path. Probable, worth a human look.
 *   - `default` — fell through to core because nothing else claimed it.
 *                 This is the weakest signal in the report and is counted
 *                 separately so it cannot be mistaken for evidence.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/repo-partition.ts                 # summary to stdout
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/repo-partition.ts --edges         # + every cross-edge
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/repo-partition.ts --markdown      # report as Markdown
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/repo-partition.ts --repo sci      # one repo's modules
 *   bun run cat-harness/scripts/repo-partition.ts --strict        # exit 1 if cross-edges
 *
 * @module scripts/repo-partition
 * @covers code — every module and every edge between them; a module it cannot classify is
 *   `unassigned` and a finding

// This file was 1,194 lines: the algorithm, this instance's 272 lines of
// exception data, and 532 lines of rationale for that data, in one module.
// The algorithm is now `partition/engine.ts` and takes a spec; the data is
// `partition/instance-rules.ts` and keeps every comment, positioned where it
// was. What is left here is argument handling and the report — the two parts
// that are genuinely about running the tool from a terminal.
//
// `classify` and `analyse` are re-exported at their old names and old arity,
// bound to this instance's spec. Nothing imports them today (the partition
// tool is standalone; every other mention of it in the tree is prose), but
// the gate is invoked by name from CI and by hand constantly, and a rename
// nobody needed is a rename that costs somebody a confused minute.

  // ── SCOPE, printed WITH the number rather than assumed by the reader.
  //
  // Bean `p11x`. This tool's ROOT is ONE instance, so every wrong-direction
  // count it has ever printed is scoped to that instance's own modules and is
  // silent about edges between already-extracted siblings. A PR citing the
  // bare number therefore made an over-broad claim, which had to be corrected
  // by comment on #1465 — and the bean's own line is that the fix belongs
  // here rather than in per-PR prose.
  //
  // The owner ruled Option 2 (2026-09-30): this tool STAYS instance-scoped
  // and `kg:detangle` owns the cross-instance axis. Option 3 — print the
  // scope — was NOT the option chosen, and its substance comes along anyway
  // because the two are not alternatives any more. Option 3 was rejected as
  // a fix-substitute: it "stops the over-broad read without making anything
  // visible". Under Option 2 something IS visible, so the same print line
  // stops standing in for a fix and becomes the pointer TO one.
  //
  // It goes further than Option 3 asked, deliberately. A bare
  // `(scope: cat-harness/)` tells a reader the number is narrower than it
  // looks and leaves them to find the wide one; naming the check that owns
  // the other question ROUTES them instead. A reader who knows a number is
  // incomplete and cannot find its complement is not much better off than
  // one who never doubted it.
  //
  // DERIVED from `ROOT` and `SCAN_ROOTS`, never spelled out: this instance's
  // name is exactly the thing the bean recorded as wrong to assume, and a
  // literal here would go stale on the next relocation while still reading
  // as authoritative.

  // ── What this gate ENFORCES. Both axes, as of 2026-09-20.
  //
  // `check:partition` ran in CI WITHOUT `--strict`, so its only failing path
  // was one nothing invoked: it reported 8 wrong-direction edges and exited 0
  // while the board read 43/43, and three of those edges had been introduced
  // that morning. A gate that CANNOT fail is indistinguishable, from the
  // outside, from one that passed — bean `xom7`, one level up from the
  // workflow it was written about.
  //
  // The repository's precedent for switching a reporter into an enforcer is
  // the ruff comment in `code-quality-gates.yml`: **a check is an error only
  // once its count is zero.** Turning a red gate on just teaches the next
  // agent to append `|| true`.
  //
  // So it was applied per axis as each reached zero. Unassigned reached zero
  // first (bean `4j3h`) and was enforced then; the comment there said to
  // delete the distinction once the edges followed. They have — `jcmx`
  // retired the last one, `src/types.ts -> schemas/types.ts`, by declaring
  // the structural minimum a harness signature needs instead of importing
  // the content model. Both axes are now zero and both are enforced.
  //
  // `--strict` is kept as an accepted no-op so existing invocations do not
  // break; there is no longer a laxer mode for it to select.
  //
  // ── BOTH AXES ARE ZERO AND ENFORCED WITHIN ONE INSTANCE, and that is not
  // the same sentence as "the layering holds". Bean `p11x`, corrected
  // 2026-09-30 on the owner's Option 2 ruling.
  //
  // The paragraph above was read — here, in the migration plan, and on at
  // least one PR — as discharging Phase I.1, whose gate is "the cross-edge
  // list is empty or every survivor has a written reason". It does not,
  // because `ROOT` is this instance and the scan never leaves it. `bf5l`
  // measured the gap rather than arguing it: with a real wrong-direction
  // import in place (`cat-harness/schemas/intake.ts` importing
  // `folio-assistant-core`), `check:instance-graph` said no cycle, THIS TOOL
  // said 0, and `kg:detangle` said 1. Three green checks did not mean the
  // layering held.
  //
  // So I.1's gate is now BOTH this tool and `kg:detangle:direction`, which is
  // blocking in CI and whose node layer IS the instance. Neither discharges
  // I.1 alone; they answer different questions and are not each other's
  // second opinion. Option 1 — widening `ROOT`/`SCAN_ROOTS` to the checkout —
  // was considered and NOT taken: the path rules here are written against
  // instance-relative paths, so it would have meant a large reclassification
  // across ~17 instances to reach a fact another tool already reports.
