/**
 * The merge queue's ORDER — live facts in, the reprioritisation table's
 * answer out.
 *
 * Bean `hfag`. The queue STORES decisions (`schemas/merge-queue.ts`); this
 * module COMPUTES the facts a decision is made from, at the moment it is
 * made, and hands them to `processes/sdlc/decisions/merge-priority.dmn`. It
 * writes nothing: what the steward acts on is recorded as a queue entry by
 * the steward, and the facts it was computed from stay GitHub's.
 *
 * Three pieces, each the place one rule lives:
 *
 * - {@link authoredPaths} / {@link touchesShared} — technique **T3** of the
 *   requirements note on `claude/merge-pipeline-library`
 *   (`cat-harness/docs/proposals/merge-pipeline-requirements.md` §5): the
 *   cheap conflict test. Independence is decided on AUTHORED paths and
 *   shared declarations (R6; SQ19 §5.2, pp. 7–8), with GENERATED paths
 *   excluded (R7), because `merge-conflict-patterns` already resolves those
 *   mechanically and counting them makes every pair conflict. "Authored" is
 *   asked of that registry — a path its declared patterns would REFUSE —
 *   rather than restated here.
 * - {@link deriveFacts} — the inputs the table reads, by the names
 *   `MemberFactsSchema` fixes, so the tools that emit them (`merge:overlap`
 *   on `claude/merge-pipeline-tools`) and this reader agree.
 * - {@link placeAll} / {@link orderQueue} — evaluate the table per PR, then
 *   order: owner overrides at their positions, the admitted by rank then PR
 *   number (oldest first), the handed-back last.
 *
 * SQ19 = Ananthanarayanan et al., *Keeping Master Green at Scale*, EuroSys '19.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/scripts/merge-queue
 * @covers none — a library the merge steward and the tile call; it judges no declared graph
