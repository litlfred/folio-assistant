/**
 * Does every arrow point from the dependent to the general node?
 *
 * The rule is data-modelling step 8: when two nodes are related, the one that
 * depends on the other holds the pointer, and the general node names none of
 * its dependents. #1168 flipped the arrows that broke it — lanes, voices,
 * stories, scripts, `satisfiedBy`, a graph kind's skill, a test's subject.
 * This is what stops the next one being written (B5).
 *
 * Which nodes are general is a MODELLING DECISION, so it is declared, never
 * inferred: a schema declaration whose doc comment carries `@general`
 * (`schema-graph.ts` reads it). Two sources are checked:
 *
 * - **Schemas.** A `@general` declaration may `@ref` only another `@general`
 *   one. A field pointing from a general node at anything else is the
 *   general node naming a dependent.
 * - **Processes.** A BPMN diagram is the authored form of a Process, which is
 *   general, so each `<folio:…>` element that points at another artefact
 *   must point at a general one. {@link PROCESS_POINTERS} lists the elements
 *   that do; any other element carrying a pointer attribute is a finding.
 *
 * What it cannot see is stated rather than implied: a bare string field with
 * no `@ref` holds no arrow this reader can follow (B8 types those), and a
 * general node's PROSE naming its dependents is not parsed here.
 *
 * @module scripts/arrow-direction

/**
 * The part of `schema-graph.ts`'s reading this check uses, declared here
 * rather than imported: the reader is a core module and this one is harness,
