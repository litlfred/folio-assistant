*What happened to `STAGING/<slug>`?* — `_render-log/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl` at the
branch ROOT, outside `STAGING/` so `rm -rf "STAGING/$SLUG"` cannot reach it.

A full replace does NOT preserve it: `CARRIED_PREFIXES` in
`restore-staging.ts` carries it across, and `--verify` checks the carry as well
as the previews. Add a prefix there, never a third code path. Skill:
[`ui-core/render-logging.md`](../skills/ui/ui-core/render-logging.md).
