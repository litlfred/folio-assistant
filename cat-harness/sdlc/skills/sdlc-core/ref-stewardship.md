# Ref stewardship — one ref, many writers, one steward

A **watched ref** is a long-lived branch that several processes write and that
something downstream consumes serially. `main` is one. `gh-pages` is one. Each
`cat/cat-harness/*` store branch is one. A feature branch is **not** — it has
one writer and no downstream serialisation, and giving it a steward buys
nothing and adds a single point of failure.

A watched ref is `main`, `gh-pages`, or a branch a declaring directory's
`storage` (or `source`) names. There is no central table. A ref nothing
declares is not a watched ref, and this skill does not apply to it.

## What a steward is FOR, and what it must not become

[`role-model`](../../../skills/process/process-core/role-model.md): nothing *is* a
steward. An actor **acts as** one inside a process, for the duration of a lane,
over **one named ref**. The ref is a parameter of the lane instance, not a
property of the persona — which is why `merge-steward` names no ref in its own
description and why a second contended ref can acquire a steward without a
schema change.

The rule it inherits from [`merge-queue`](merge-queue.md):

> **A steward stores DECISIONS. It never stores a fact the host already
> knows.**

So a window may record *when it opened, when it must close, who holds it, and
who takes over*. It must never record the ref's tip SHA, a deployment's
conclusion, or whether the site is live. Those move, and a stored copy is a
second answer that goes stale on the next push.
`MergeQueueEntrySchema.FORBIDDEN_FACT_KEYS` refuses the tempting ones by name;
a ref window is a sibling object under the same rule.

## A window is NOT a hold, and the difference is what ends it

Per [`merge-queue` §"A hold has an EXPIRY and a trigger"](merge-queue.md), a
hold ends on **the observation that lifts it, not a time**. A hold whose reason
you cannot restate from current facts is a habit.

A coalescing window looks like a hold and is a different object:

| | **hold** | **coalescing window** |
|---|---|---|
| what it is waiting for | a condition to become true | **more arrivals** |
| what ends it | the observation that lifts it | the clock, *and* a bound |
| why not the other way | a time cannot know the condition cleared | *"no more arrivals"* is only ever observable by waiting |

A window is timed because it waits on the absence of a future event, which has
no observation; a hold waits on a present condition, which does.

**A hold that never ends starves, and a window that never closes starves
identically.**
So a window carries a hard maximum and closes at it even while pushes keep
arriving. A window that extends on every arrival is not a window, it is an
outage with a timer.

## Coalesce into one write per window

The shape, for a ref with *n* writers arriving in bursts:

1. A write request **does not push**. It records its intent against the ref's
   open window, opening one if none is open.
2. The window closes at its deadline — never later, whatever is still arriving.
3. The steward performs **one** write for the window, composing the requests.
4. Anything that arrived after the close belongs to the next window.

**Composition is only sound when the writes do not contend**, and for a
route-keyed store they do not: `branch-store`'s `keyedBy: "route"` gives each
route one owning generator, so *"nobody authored either side, so the newer
generation wins"*. Two requests for **different** routes compose
by union. Two for the **same** route compose by taking the newer.

**The case that must still be reported:** two same-route requests where
different authors wrote both sides. Route keying says the newer wins, and that
is correct for a regenerated page and wrong for authored content. A steward that
silently takes the newer in that case has deleted the only signal that the two
writers disagree. Report it; do not resolve it.

### Why a GitHub concurrency group is not a window

`cancel-in-progress: false` governs the RUNNING job, not the pending one, and
**GitHub cancels a PENDING job when a newer one queues for the same group.** So
a concurrency group keeps at most one pending run. It is not a queue, and
`cancel-in-progress: false` is not coalescing — it protects the job in flight
and silently drops the intermediate ones. It is worth having to protect the
job in flight, and must not be described as coalescing. No concurrency setting
can coalesce bursts of writes to a ref like `gh-pages`; that needs a steward.

## The window's four durable fields — because of HANDOVER

A window that lives in one agent's head is lost at handover, and the next
steward then either waits for a window that will never close or opens a second
one and double-pushes. **So the window is committed state, in the
`workflow-state` graph under `beans/workflows/`, not a variable.**

The four fields are `HoldSchema`'s (`schemas/sdlc/merge-queue.ts`), for the
same reason
([`bean-blocking`](../../../work-plan/skills/work-plan/bean-blocking.md)'s `## Blocked on`):
a window with no expiry cannot be told from an abandoned one.

`schemas/sdlc/ref-window.ts` is the type. Three fields are `HoldSchema`'s verbatim
and the fourth is narrowed:

| field | for a window | without it |
|---|---|---|
| `ref` | the watched ref — `HoldSchema`'s `waitsOn`, narrowed from prose to a declared ref | a reader cannot tell which ref this window is for |
| `since` | when it opened | the deadline cannot be checked, only trusted |
| `expires` | the hard close — **after `since`**, enforced by refine | abandoned and open are indistinguishable |
| `handoff` | who takes it if this steward stops | the next steward cannot tell "mine to close" from "someone else's in flight" |

Two more the type carries for the same reason. `heldBy` says whose window it
is, and `closedAt` says whether the single write happened — **absent means open
OR abandoned, and `expires` is the only thing that tells those apart**, so a
reader must never take an absent `closedAt` for "still collecting".

There is **no `extend`**, and the object is strict, so an extra field is
refused rather than ignored: `expires` is set once, at open, as a property of
the type rather than a promise in prose. A hold's expiry
stops it outliving its justification; a window's expiry *is* its
justification, and also stops it outliving its burst.

## The two gaps a steward reports rather than fixes

A declaration can disagree with the world in **both** directions, and a sweep
that checks one direction reads as clean while the other is broken:

- a declared writer that no longer writes the ref — the declaration is stale;
- **a workflow that writes the ref and is not declared** — the declaration is
  incomplete, and this is the one a grep over the declaration cannot find,
  because it is looking in the wrong file.

For example, an action that defaults `publish_branch: gh-pages` writes the ref
without naming it. Adding the missing line is the symptom; the fix is a gate
comparing declared against measured and failing either way.

And a sweep **prints its denominator**
([`generalise-the-fix`](generalise-the-fix.md) §1.2a) — `parsed 35 of 35`
beside the verdict — and parses rather than matching text, since a plain string
match also counts comments.

## What this does not do yet

- **No steward runs over `gh-pages`.** The ref is declared; until its
  producers write through `branch-store`'s route keying there is no window to
  hold.
- **No steward runs over the `cat/cat-harness/*` refs.** They are seeded and
  declared and, per their declarations, *"not authoritative"*. A steward over a
  ref nobody reads from would be ceremony.
- **Nothing writes a window yet.** `schemas/sdlc/ref-window.ts` types one and
  `ref-window.test.ts` holds it to the handover rules, but no steward opens one,
  because there is nothing to coalesce until the producers stop pushing
  directly. The type comes first so that a steward's handover is tested
  before the steward exists.
- **The parity between the window and the hold is behavioural, not structural.**
  `SHARED_LEASE_FIELDS` is the declared list and the test removes each field
  from both schemas and requires both to refuse. A key-list comparison would
  not work: a `.refine()` does not expose its inner object, and a parity check
  that silently compared two empty lists would pass forever.
