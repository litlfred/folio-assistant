# CRDM — the data-modelling phase

**This skill says WHEN and WITH WHOM. It does not say how to model.** That is
[`data-modelling`](../../../skills/kg/kg-core/data-modelling.md), and it is deliberately free of CRDM so
a folio modelling data outside a requirements process can read it without
inheriting a methodology it is not running.

Where the two disagree, **the technique wins and this page is wrong**.

## Where it sits, and why there

Between **requirements** (phases 2–4) and **sign-off** (phase 5).

Requirements are statements about things; the model says what the things ARE.
The entities come from the business-process analysis (phase 2), and phase 5
must not sign off requirements whose nouns were never pinned. Drafted too
early, the model is invented from nothing; drafted too late, two stakeholders
approve the same sentence meaning different things.

`Call_DataModel` in `crdm-requirements.bpmn` is the `callActivity` after
`Call_Requirements` and before `Call_Signoff`.

## What it consumes

| from | what |
|---|---|
| phase 1, needs | the domain vocabulary the BA actually used |
| phase 2, BPA | the activities — every verb whose object is a candidate entity |
| phases 3–4, requirements | each requirement's nouns, which the model must be able to express |

**A requirement the model cannot express is a finding, not a modelling
failure.** It means the requirement is about something nobody has named, and
the remedy is to name it. That is why this phase sits after requirements
rather than before.

## The sign-off, and who gives it

The agent drafts; the **BA confirms the entities are the ones they meant**;
the **stakeholders confirm the cardinalities**. Those are two different
questions and are asked of two different lanes on purpose:

- *Are these the things?* — a naming question, and the BA owns the domain
  vocabulary.
- *Is it really one per?* — an operational question, and the people who run
  the process know where the exceptions are.

The agent asks both and decides neither: the BA knows the domain, the agent
does not guess, because a wrong cardinality is invisible until the data
arrives.

## What it hands on

A declared model, readable by a tool, per step 6 of the technique. Phase 5
signs off requirements **against** it: whether each requirement is
expressible, not only whether it is wanted.

## The loop, and when to leave it

Like every other CRDM phase this one loops until confirmed, and the gateway
is the phase. **Leave when the BA recognises the entities and the
stakeholders have answered every cardinality** — not when the model looks
complete, because an unanswered cardinality is a hole exactly where the
exceptions live.

## Not decided by this skill

Whether the model is expressed as Zod, JSON Schema, a class diagram or prose
is `placement`'s question and the folio's choice. This phase requires only
that the artefact is **declared**, so the next phase can read it rather than
be told about it.
