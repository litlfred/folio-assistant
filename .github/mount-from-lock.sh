# Lay down every remote mount `index.lock.json` records, on a checkout that has
# none of them yet.
#
# The replayer is `scripts/mount-from-lock.ts` in cat-harness-tools (in
# cat-harness until bean 70lx moved the harness's code out), and that instance
# is itself one of the mounts — so on a fresh clone the tool that would mount
# it is not on disk. This breaks that loop the smallest way: read the commit
# the lock pins for it, fetch ONLY that one file at that commit, and run
# it. The script imports nothing but `node:*` (see its header), so one file is
# all it needs; every decision — instances, commits, directories, digests — is
# still the lock's, and the script still verifies each tree digest.
#
# CI calls this before anything else in a job, and so does the session-start
# hook. It is idempotent: a mount already on disk and intact is reported
# `current`. Extra arguments go to the replayer (e.g. `--check`).
#
# Usage: .github/mount-from-lock.sh [--root <dir>] [replayer args…]
