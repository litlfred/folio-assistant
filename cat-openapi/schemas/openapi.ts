/**
 * The OpenAPI harness's shapes: what an instance declares, what an ingest
 * records, and how an OpenAPI document's OPERATIONS become nodes with IRIs.
 *
 * @module cat-openapi/schemas/openapi
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * ## The node is the document; the operation is a node inside it
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-03 (bean `s4ta`): *"kind is an OpenAPI node. need page + IRI
 * for each operation."* So a directory of graph kind `openapi` holds OpenAPI
 * documents, one node each, and every operation in a document is a node of
 * its own, addressable the way `harness-requirements` §"Serialisations"
 * requires of every node: `<…>/<doc>/<operation>.jsonld` and `.json`, with
 * its rendering — a thin page — at `<…>/<doc>/<operation>/`.
 *
 * ## The operation's id
 *
 * The document's own `operationId` where it gives one, because that is the
 * name the API's authors chose and a client generator already uses. Where it
 * gives none, `<method>-<path>` made filename-safe. The two cannot collide
 * silently: {@link operationsOf} refuses a document in which two operations
 * would share an id, rather than suffixing one and minting an IRI nobody
 * chose.
 *
 * ## Why the document is validated so little
 *
 * {@link OpenApiDocumentSchema} checks what this harness READS — the version,
 * `info.title`, and `paths` with their operations — and passes everything
 * else through. A full OpenAPI validator would refuse documents the published
 * API serves today over a detail no page here renders; the source of truth
 * for the API is its authors, and the harness renders what they published.
