/**
 * The QA icon has to OPEN, and what it opens has to name its witnesses.
 *
 * Bean `g6yr` shipped the icon as a dead `<span>` with counts in a tooltip, and
 * closed with the honest note that how it looks was never verified. This spec
 * is the missing half: a real browser, the real `docs-ui.js`, and the real
 * `qa-witness/v1` files the generator wrote — not a hand-made fixture that can
 * agree with the code while the code disagrees with the corpus.
 *
 * Every assertion below is about a fact a reader would otherwise have to take
 * on trust:
 *
 *  - a criterion's verdict is reachable at all;
 *  - the witness behind it is named, with the hash of the checker that ran;
 *  - a verdict measured against a file that has since changed says STALE, and
 *    names the file that moved;
 *  - a field the sidecar does not record prints "not recorded" rather than
 *    blank — `kg-audit.ts` writes no timestamp, and a blank cell reads as a
 *    value the reader missed;
 *  - a fetch that fails says so, naming the file. A panel that opens empty is
 *    indistinguishable from a subject with nothing to report.
 *
 * The page is served through `page.route` rather than from a committed fixture:
 * the harness is the theme's structure plus one icon, and the JSON is read off
 * disk, so nothing here can drift from what the generator produces.
