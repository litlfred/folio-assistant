/**
 * Which languages a MODEL is good at, and whether anybody checked.
 *
 * @module bootstrap/schemas/model-registry
 * @graphNode schema
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-21: *"note if agent was not trained primaruily in english,
 * the agent/person staring the bootstrap on that model should potentially use
 * other lanuges than english (especially if human validated) should clarify
 * each new model added to bootstrap which of the preferred languages"*.
 * Bean `46uh`.
 *
 * ## Why this lives in bootstrap
 *
 * The same reason everything else here does: an agent reaching for the
 * language it should communicate in **has not yet loaded the harness that
 * would otherwise answer**. A model registry in cat-harness would be
 * unreachable in exactly the case it exists for — the opening steps of a
 * session on a model nobody has looked at.
 *
 * ## "Especially if human validated" is the whole design
 *
 * A model's own claim about which languages it handles well **is not
 * evidence**. It is a generated assertion about a generated system, and this
 * repository draws the line between a determined answer and an assumed one
 * everywhere else — a QA sidecar's `reviewer.kind`, an interaction
 * preference's `source`, a lane that DECLARES its performer varies rather
 * than merely having no role.
 *
 * So {@link ModelEntry.validation} is required and has three values, and the
 * middle one is the point: `self-reported` is not a weaker `human-validated`,
 * it is a DIFFERENT KIND OF CLAIM. Collapsing them to a boolean would make
 * "somebody checked" and "the model said so" the same fact.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT license
 *
 * **An agent choosing a language because its model prefers one.** The owner
 * was explicit and the reasoning is not subtle: a model strong in a language
 * the person cannot read is *worse* than the fallback, not better. These
 * languages are ONE INPUT to a determination the
 * [`communication-language`](../skills/communication-language.md) skill makes,
 * ranked below the person's stated preference and below the language of their
 * own turns. A registry that was read as the answer would be a regression
 * dressed as a feature.
