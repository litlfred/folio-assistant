Each shipped once:

1. **Modules prefixed `QOU.`** regardless of the folio's Lake library. Now
   read from `lakefile.toml`, and left **unprefixed** when no lakefile names
   one — *a wrong namespace is worse than none*, because it is what a reader
   pastes into an `import`.
2. **Workflow descriptions from a hardcoded map of twelve `qou` filenames**,
   consulted *before* the workflow's own `name:`. Now always the `name:`.
3. **The simulator directory as the literal `folio-assistant/simulators`.**
   Now `<name>.config.json`, and the fallback is the folio-root `simulators`
   — the platform has no such directory since 2026-09-19.
