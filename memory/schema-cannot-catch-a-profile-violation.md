`content/pipeline/profile-check.ts` runs on every `content_validate` and
catches what **Zod structurally cannot**: a `theorem` is a valid `theorem`
whatever folio it sits in, and `constraints.ts` cannot read
`<name>.config.json`.

Two rules: kind-within-profile, and (document only) **no `lean` field and no
`.lean` sibling** — because `remark`, `example`, `algorithm` and `simulator`
all *declare* an optional `lean` that the type permits and the profile
forbids.
