summary: "a page is a translation because it declares `lang`, never because of its directory's name"

`docs/fr/index.md` is French because it carries `lang: fr` and
`translation_source: index.md`. **Never** match a directory name against a
list of language subtags: a `no/` chapter is hidden, a `translated-fr/` one is
shown as source, and neither announces itself. Do **not** add a graph kind for
translated content — a translation is the same kind of thing as the page it
translates, differing by a field the FILE declares. Translatability is a
property of a FORMAT within a content type (`schemas/translation-tools.ts`,
`isTranslatable`), per the owner: *"its not so much the node schema itself but
its content (e.g. markdown, bpmn) should be translatable"*. `nav_exclude: true`
is the half JS cannot do — just-the-docs builds the nav once, for every
reader, before anybody picks a locale. Full rule:
`skills/folio-core/translation-manager.md#the-navbar-filters-by-locale`.
