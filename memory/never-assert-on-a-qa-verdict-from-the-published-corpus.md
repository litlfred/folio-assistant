`test/results/witnesses/**` is live state. A test that reads a VERDICT out of it
breaks when somebody fixes or adjudicates the finding — which is the system
working, not a regression.

**Read the document live and flip the ONE criterion you test, BY ID, where it
sits.** Do not freeze a captured copy: freezing the criterion freezes its
witness, so the hash literal outlives the checker. And never hoist the failure
to `criteria[0]` — the generator already sorts worst-first, so a panel that
sorted nothing would pass.

<!-- detail -->

Measured 2026-09-19 (bean `tywj`): `test/qa-panel.e2e.ts` pinned the first row
to `voice-status-leak`/`fail`/`critical`, the fold count to `47` and the checker
hash to `5af6856733f3`. An adjudication in `c8fbad385` turned that criterion
`pass`; four assertions went red for reasons unrelated to the panel.

The settled answer (#319) keeps only the script witness, so the hash the spec
asserts is still the corpus's own.

I tried freezing a captured copy and withdrew it: reading the value out of a
frozen document makes the assertion self-consistent, not correct — the same
defect one field down.

`severity`, `evidence` and `changed` exist only in states the corpus is not in,
so no live sidecar vouches for them. Beans `tywj`, `qjyi`, `iumj`.
