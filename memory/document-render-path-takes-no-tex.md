`content/pipeline/render-markdown.ts` assembles the folio to one Markdown
file; `document_render_{md,html,pdf}` take it through pandoc, the PDF via
weasyprint/prince/wkhtmltopdf. It **never** falls back to `latexmk`,
deliberately — a PDF that silently came out of LaTeX would misreport what the
folio needs to build, and the next person on a clean machine pays for that.
Registered for **both** content types, because it is the render that works
while drafting on a machine with no TeX.
