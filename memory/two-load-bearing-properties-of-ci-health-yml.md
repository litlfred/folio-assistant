Not incidental; do not simplify either away.

- **`fetch-depth: 0`.** The `superseded` rule asks `git log` when a workflow
  file last changed, and a shallow clone cannot answer — which would
  resurrect the false fires the rule exists to retire.
- **On "could not check" (exit 2) it leaves the tracking issue UNTOUCHED and
  fails the job**, rather than closing it. A watchdog going blind must not
  read as good news. A red `ci-health.yml` is itself reported by next week's
  run.
