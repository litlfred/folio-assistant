  // `auap`): `test/` because a declaration in `harness.json` pointed at
  // `test/results/`, `tests/` because this one line pointed here. An id in a
  // declaration is the expensive thing to move, a `testDir` is one line, so
  // the specs came to the declaration rather than the other way round.
  // `cat-harness/test`: the specs moved with the instance (bean `wggr`) while
  // this config stays at the REPOSITORY root, beside `package.json`, because
  // `playwright test` is run from there. A stale `testDir` does not error — it
  // collects ZERO specs and reports a clean run, which is the `dh4f` shape and
  // exactly what a green e2e job over nothing would have looked like.

  // runners on separate conventions is what stops an e2e spec reddening the
  // unit-test gate. It is also what makes sharing a directory with
  // `test/results/` (504 committed JSON verdicts) and `test/health/*.test.ts`
