title: 'FEATURE-STAGING: the workflow definition comes from the BASE but the checkout is the PR HEAD, so a newly-added step fails every branch that predates it'

## The split

`.github/workflows/feature-staging.yml:190` checks out the PR **head**:

```yaml
ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref || inputs.branch || github.ref }}
```

But for a `pull_request` event GitHub takes the workflow **definition** from the
BASE branch. So the steps that run are `main`'s, while the tree they run
against is the PR's head. Those two disagree the moment a step is added that
invokes something new.

## Measured 2026-10-03

A step `Publish the identifier lookup` landed on `main` in `d8207832fea` at
**14:24:38** (bean `1br0`, #1972 step 3). PR #2001's head `11ae41ee55a`
branched before that:

```
$ git cat-file -e 11ae41ee55a:cat-harness-tools/scripts/publish-id-lookup.ts
fatal: path '...' does not exist in '11ae41ee55a'
$ git cat-file -e origin/main:cat-harness-tools/scripts/publish-id-lookup.ts
(exists)
```

So the run executed `main`'s step 17 against a tree with no such script, and
`stage` failed at exactly that step. The seven runs that passed between 15:01
and 15:14 were all on branches that had merged `main` after 14:24:38; the one
that failed, at 15:21, had not.

## Why it is worse than a plain stale-branch failure

**The failure names a file the author never touched**, so the natural reading
is "my branch broke the staging build". It was nearly read that way here: the
failing branch was the ONLY failure in 30 runs of this workflow against 7
successes, and a 1-in-30 statistic points hard at the one. The branch was
innocent; it was merely old.

This is the one place in this repository where *"the workflow is the
authority"* and *"the checkout is the head"* disagree, and nothing says so.

It also fires in **bursts**: an arc landing in steps (#1972 is landing in
steps) adds a step, and from that instant every open PR that has not merged
`main` fails staging until it does. With ~20 open PRs that is ~20 misleading
failures per added step.

## Not fixed here, and the options are not equivalent

Three shapes, and they differ in what they give up:

1. **Check out the merge ref** instead of the head, so the definition and the
   tree come from the same place. Closest to correct; changes what a preview
   previews (the merge result, not the branch) — which may be what a reviewer
   wants anyway, or may not.
2. **Guard each step** on the existence of what it invokes. Keeps previewing
   the branch; pays a conditional per step forever, and a skipped step is the
   `1xhc` shape unless it reports.
3. **Leave it and document it**, so the next reader is not misled.

Option 1 changes the meaning of a preview and that is a decision, not a fix.

## Done when

- [x] the owner picks a shape, or rules that documenting it is enough
- [x] whichever lands, a stale branch's staging run no longer names a script
      its author never touched
- [x] the hazard is written where somebody debugging a red `stage` will find
      it, not only in this bean (landed on `main` in `folio-assistant#2618`, `7b7d0736b2`, in `.github/workflows/feature-staging.yml`)

## Note (2026-10-10, drain ml9h)

Lane B scrapped the cat-harness-tools copy because the subject lives in folio-assistant / cat-harness; THIS copy is the owning one and stays open.

_2026-10-22T00:40Z_ — Lane C (session https://claude.ai/code/session_018NFVUeJjQJdrEU32AS1Mco): still live on main (`feature-staging.yml` checks out the PR head under the base's step list). Done-when #3 is up as folio-assistant#2618, a comment on the checkout step and no behaviour change. The owner decision is in that PR: (1, recommended) check out the merge ref, (2) guard each step, (3) document only. Default 3.

## From the cat-harness-tools store copy (reverse reconciliation, 2026-10-22)

_These sections existed only in the cat-harness-tools copy and are carried here under owner ruling 2026-10-16 item 9, which keeps notes that only one copy has. They are historical and do not change this bean's status. The forward direction is litlfred/cat-harness-tools#558. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BiusQ9uAZiHP6TUhfwZ2h6._

### Reasons for Scrapping

Scrapped 2026-10-10 in the cat-harness-tools store (lane B drain): **the subject is not in this repository.** It concerns folio-assistant's `.github/workflows/feature-staging.yml` (definition from BASE, checkout from HEAD), and its first done-when is the owner choosing one of its three shapes for that workflow. The copy of this bean in the `cat/cat-harness/beans` store (litlfred/folio-assistant) sits with that subject and is the live one. It should stay open there and not be closed as a mirror.

_2026-10-16T06:30:00Z_ — Store reconciliation: status `scrapped` → `todo` (Owner ruling 2026-10-16, item 9: "based on semantic content"; the copies said folio-assistant: todo, cat-harness: scrapped, cat-harness-tools: scrapped). Evidence: same as 197s: scrapped only as "not in this repository"; the owner has not chosen among the three feature-staging shapes. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01Pc8vSeXCwp5Ckvmz56cMDs.

_2026-10-22T17:10Z_ — Lane C (session https://claude.ai/code/session_018NFVUeJjQJdrEU32AS1Mco): **resolved.** The owner chose option 1 on 2026-10-22 ("Check out merge ref"). folio-assistant#2624 (merged as 6cf10d9) makes `feature-staging.yml` check out `github.sha` on `pull_request`, which is the PR's test merge commit: the steps and the tree they run against now come from the same merge, so a step added on main runs against a tree that has its script. Push and workflow_dispatch are unchanged. Its own staging run built from the merge commit (0aa9d5f), not the head. The comment from #2618 stays on the checkout step (done-when 3).
