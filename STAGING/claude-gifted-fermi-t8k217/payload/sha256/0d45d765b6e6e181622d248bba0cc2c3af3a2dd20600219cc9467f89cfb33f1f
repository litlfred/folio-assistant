PR #2055, handed back by the Merge Manager on 2026-10-04 (BACKFILLED at 14:50Z: the hand-back was made as a PR comment and a queue entry only, without this bean. Owner: "Backfill + enforce").

## Refused
- `merge:steward` at 14:30Z: Rule_HeadNotGreen: conflict declared, own CI missing-required.
- Queue entry (`beans/queue/litlfred--folio-assistant--2055.json`, status `waiting-on-author`): Covered by the owner's standing approval (it was in the queue at 12:15Z). Takeover plan posted (the author stalled): conflicts with main only on the LSI trio (generated). The body's 'Special-branch budgets' and 'health re-run' items are done (ec2edc0, 78994a5), but staging-preview-size reads unknown in the shipped report. Couples with #2080 (same author, 9 shared paths) and #2066. (Previously: STATUS UNKNOWN on the 13:40Z all-PR review (open, not in the queue), triaged as: CI red and conflicted, no push for 5h. Its follow-up #2080 (same author, 5hox) is open alongside it.)
- No bean named in the PR; parented under the steward epic `nok9`.

## Roles
- Fix: whoever holds #2055: its author or a takeover session that names itself in the PR body.
- Land: the Merge Manager, through `merge:guard --merge` with the owner's yes.

## Brief
Takeover plan (measured state, ordered steps, owner questions): https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/pull/2055#issuecomment-5980838458

## Report to
A comment on PR #2055, plus a message to the Merge Manager role.

## Done when
- [ ] #2055 merges main cleanly (merge commit; `git submodule update --init` before staging; no dropped `*/test/results/*` files)
- [ ] the owed `pull_request` CI is green on that head
- [ ] the body names the owning session; `ready-to-merge` label; signed `ready: <head sha>`
- [ ] `bun run merge:guard 2055` passes all 7 checks, and it lands (or the owner closes it)
