Owner approved 2026-10-01 late (~17:30, session_01ToWZR4RgTRCWeSsgxsSQfT) as speed-up 4 of 4 for the merge treadmill (S2 `0mf0`, epic `7x5n`). Siblings: input-hash skip, parallel checks, CI merge:main (`d33q` part B).

## What
Three CI changes to `.github/workflows/code-quality-gates.yml` (and the other gate workflows):
1. **Sharding** — split the long `gates` job (and `bun test`) into parallel shards with a final aggregate status, so the slowest job sets the wall-clock rather than the sum.
2. **BPMN cache** — cache the rendered BPMN / UML outputs keyed by the hash of their inputs, so `render:bpmn:check` and friends do not re-render unchanged diagrams.
3. **Shallow checkout** — `fetch-depth` as small as each job allows; jobs that genuinely need history (merge-base, rename detection) say so.

## Falsifier
A shard that silently runs nothing is green. So: the aggregate must check that every gate ran in exactly one shard (the union of shards = `gates.ts`'s derived list). A cache keyed on less than the real inputs serves stale renders; key on the same declared inputs as the input-hash skip. A shallow job that needs history must fail loudly, never fall back to "no renames" (cf. the reference-direction ratchet's `could not determine renames`).

## Note
Another agent is editing `code-quality-gates.yml` for this; other PRs keep their workflow edits to single added steps so merges stay trivial.

## Done when
- [x] parallelism: `bun test` as four SEQUENTIAL shards (Bun `--parallel` hung — measured); e2e as 3 shards; each behind an aggregate that keeps the check name and is red unless every part succeeded; unrun-gates step in its own job
- [x] ~~BPMN render cache keyed on inputs~~ — measured, not worth building (see Re-scoped)
- [x] ~~per-job fetch-depth~~ — already depth 1 everywhere in this workflow (see Re-scoped)
- [x] measured: CI wall-clock before/after over ≥3 runs — 8m18s–8m36s → 3m25s–3m49s (see "After")

Re-parented 2026-10-02 from `7x5n` to the merge-pipeline epic `hfag` on the owner's ruling; `hfag` blocks `7x5n`, so the arc still waits on this.

_2026-10-02T22:08:54Z_ — Claimed by claude/zealous-thompson-y8dcf1 — pushed to main so sibling sessions see it before this branch has a PR (bean 35nj).

## Baseline, measured 2026-10-02 (session_01Jf39Vh4B8EQT6TBYzTtMCA)

`Code-quality gates` on `main`, last three completed push runs, job and step
times read from the Actions API (not estimated):

| run (merge) | wall-clock | TypeScript job | its `bun test` step | Repository gates | e2e | `render:bpmn:check` | checkout |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1895 `49c3ff2fe` | 8m18s | 8m14s | 7m30s | 5m40s | 5m25s | 2s | 10–13s |
| #1911 `909678c89` | 8m36s | 8m33s | 7m45s | 5m35s | 5m36s | 2s | 10–12s |
| #1923 `d59cab3bc` | 8m33s | 8m30s | 7m43s | 4m55s | 7m05s | 4s | 11–19s |

The critical path is the TypeScript job, and ~90 % of it is one step.

## Re-scoped by that measurement — two of the three items buy nothing

- **BPMN render cache: not built.** `rendered BPMN SVGs are current` takes
  2–4 s, inside `e2e`, which is not the critical job. The most a cache could
  save is 4 s of a job that is already off the wall-clock path.
- **Shallow checkout: nothing to do here.** `code-quality-gates.yml` sets no
  `fetch-depth` anywhere, so every job already takes the `actions/checkout`
  default of 1. Checkout costs 10–19 s per job, run in parallel.
- **What remains is `bun test`.** Bun 1.3.14 (the pinned version) has both
  `--shard=i/N` and `--parallel=N`; runners have 4 cores.

A constraint the work must respect: `gatesFrom` (`gates.ts`) splits a `bun`
line on whitespace and runs it with NO shell, so a `${{ matrix.* }}` or `$VAR`
in a `bun` line reaches the local gate run as literal text — the `9zok` shape.

## After `bun test --parallel` — measured, and the count gap explained

Local (4 cores, `BUN_OPTIONS=--smol`): sequential 903 s, 14,136 pass / 57 skip
/ 4 fail (all four 5.4–6.7 s timeouts against Bun's 5,000 ms default — this
container's slowness, all four green in CI); `--parallel` 364 s, 14,140 pass /
52 skip / 0 fail. CI, dispatched run on `16c43cf40`: the `bun test` step
**3m28s** (was 7m30s–7m45s), the TypeScript job 4m13s, the workflow 5m20s —
e2e (5m16s, playwright 4m33s at `workers: 1`) became the critical path, which
is why e2e was sharded and the 1m46s–2m28s unrun-gates step split out.

**The 5 tests the parallel count lacks are never-executed ones, and their
absence is the correct state.** All 5 are the per-package block in
`lean-projects.test.ts` (`for (const pkg of LEAN_PACKAGES) describe.skipIf(!folio)…`),
skipped in BOTH modes because the platform has no folio. They are REGISTERED
sequentially only because `lean-ref-coverage.test.ts` calls
`configureLeanPackages()` and leaves the module-level registry populated for
every file loaded after it. Under `--parallel` (which implies `--isolate`) each
file starts with the registry empty, so the loop registers nothing. Measured by
per-test JUnit over the full sequential run vs the same 11 skip-bearing files
run alone: identical skip sets except those 5 names. No test that executes is
lost; the leak is a latent order-dependence `--isolate` removes.

**Bun defect found on the way:** `bun test --parallel --reporter=junit` hung
for 2,086 s (one worker at 99 % CPU) on 11 files that finish in 5 s without
`--reporter=junit`. CI does not use that reporter; anyone who adds it to the
parallel step will hit this.

## Parallel tests surfaced three tests that wrote into the real checkout

`--parallel` runs test files concurrently against ONE working tree. Three
latent races appeared, each a different pair of files per run — the shape that
gets called a flake and re-run. None is a Bun bug; each is a test writing where
another test reads.

| writer | what it wrote | reader that broke | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `navbar-consistency.test.ts` | planted `"icon": "no-such-image"` in the REAL `cat-harness.json` / `folio-assistant.json`, restored after | any test reading the declarations (MCP tool groups, implementing-path) | CI shard 1 on `1b77432d2`; local error text names the planted icon |
| `repo-files.test.ts` | an untracked probe in the real `cat-harness/scripts/` | `ns-export-skos.test.ts` (enumerates the tree) | paired: 4/4 fail; alone 0/3; after the fix 0/6 |
| 4 tests with an in-tree `__test_*__` dir (`po-resolve`, `pipeline-plugins`, `contributions`, `harness-config` — the last holds a fake instance declaration) | scratch directories inside the checkout | anything that enumerates untracked files | latent; moved pre-emptively, all 80 of their tests green from `tmpdir()` |

Fixes: the navbar test plants in a symlinked COPY of the tree; the repo-files
probe lives in a throwaway `git init` repository; the four scratch dirs moved
to `mkdtempSync(tmpdir())`. Rule for the next author: **a test writes under
`tmpdir()`, never under the checkout** — the parallel runner makes every
in-tree write somebody else's race.

`registry.test.ts` still renames `.claude/skills/registry.json` (untracked,
generated) and restores it; nothing measured reads it concurrently, so it is
left and named here rather than changed blind.

## A `bun test --parallel` HANG at 3+ workers — mitigated, not root-caused

CI shard 1/2 on `ca3468d19` ran 13+ minutes against a 2-minute norm (stopped by
the 20-minute job cap added for exactly this); a local run showed one worker
at 97 % CPU with every other worker gone. Reproduced on nine test files
(`block-placement`, `editorial-cycle-detection`, `folio-root`,
`infrastructure`, `lake-cache`, `latex-lean-coverage`, `lean-projects`,
`uses-hygiene-remedy`, `vocab-mapping-fhir`), 12-30 s cap per run against a
~2.5 s norm:

| workers | hangs |
|---|---|
| 2 | **0 / 72** |
| 3 | 8 / 20 |
| 4 (default) | 7 / 32 |
| `--isolate`, no workers | 0 / 12 |
| any single file alone, 4 workers | 0 / 72 (8 per file) |

Dropping each file in turn (3 workers, 12 runs): every removal still hung
except `uses-hygiene-remedy.test.ts` → 0 / 12. Its tests are all skipped
without a folio and its imports (`qa-checkers-uses`, `content-graph`,
`qa-utils` → `block-module`) do no visible module-level looping, so the
trigger is an interaction at 3+ workers, possibly in Bun itself — NOT yet
root-caused. **Mitigation:** `bun test --parallel=2` across THREE shards
(6 workers in all, vs 2 × 4), so the wall-clock holds. Open question for a
follow-up: what in that import graph spins, and does it reproduce on a newer
Bun.

### Update — 2 workers hung too; `--parallel` dropped

CI run 2 on `ff9d8ebb4` (3 shards × `--parallel=2`): shard 2/3's `bun test`
sat 8+ minutes against 1m14s–2m34s for its siblings — the same hang, at TWO
workers. The 0 / 72 above was a nine-file sample; the full suite reaches it.
So `--parallel` is out entirely: `bun test` runs SEQUENTIALLY in four shards on
four machines (`BUN_OPTIONS=--shard=i/4`). Sequential `bun test` has never hung
here, and separate machines share no working tree, so the in-tree races
cannot recur either. Expected per shard ≈ 7.6 min / 4 ≈ 2 min plus imbalance.
The Bun hang itself remains open (trigger set includes
`uses-hygiene-remedy.test.ts`; worth reporting upstream with the nine-file
reproduction).

## After — three green runs of the final shape on `ed8eae27b` (2026-10-03)

| run | event | wall-clock (created → done) | bun-test shards |
|---|---|---|---|
| 37088984861 | pull_request | 3m48s (first job start → last end) | 1m33s / 3m40s / 1m07s / 2m20s |
| 37089387632 | workflow_dispatch | 3m49s | — |
| 37089853408 | workflow_dispatch | 3m25s | — |

**Before: 8m18s–8m36s (three `main` runs). After: 3m25s–3m49s — about 57 % less
wall-clock.** No hang in any of them (four sequential shards, no `--parallel`).
Final shape: `typescript-static` + four sequential `typescript-test` shards +
`typescript` aggregate; `gates` and `gates-unrun` side by side; three e2e
shards (one Playwright worker per core) + `e2e` aggregate; every aggregate
carries the old check name and is red unless all its parts succeeded.

Next lever, NOT done here: bun's `--shard` splits by file COUNT, so shard 2/4
(3m40s) is the critical path while 3/4 takes 1m07s; a duration-balanced split
would bring the workflow to ~3 min.

## Summary of Changes

PR litlfred/folio-assistant#1930. `Code-quality gates` wall-clock 8m18s–8m36s
→ 3m25s–3m49s over three runs each.

- **Workflow** (`code-quality-gates.yml`): `typescript` split into
  `typescript-static` (lint, tsc) + four sequential `bun test` shards
  (`BUN_OPTIONS=--shard=i/4`, so `gatesFrom` still runs the whole suite
  locally) + an aggregate keeping the cited check name; `e2e` split into three
  Playwright shards (`E2E_SHARD`, `workers: '100%'` on CI) + aggregate; the
  1m46s–2m28s "registered and never run" step moved to its own `gates-unrun`
  job; 20-minute caps on shard jobs.
- **Tests made parallel-safe** (they wrote into the checkout): navbar-consistency
  plants in a symlinked copy; repo-files probes in a throwaway git repo; four
  in-tree `__test_*__` scratch dirs → `tmpdir()`; e2e `_kg/` generation moved to
  a Playwright `globalSetup`; gates.test and workflow-yaml.test read the job
  graph rather than one job.
- **Measured and NOT built:** BPMN render cache (2–4 s, off the critical path);
  shallow checkout (already depth 1).
- **Found and recorded:** Bun 1.3.14 `--parallel` worker hang (open, with a
  nine-file reproduction); `--parallel` + `--reporter=junit` hang; the 5-test
  count gap explained (`lean-projects` registry leak).
