Found while re-measuring my own four claims about the `merge:main` defect class
(PR #2086). THREE OF THE FOUR did not survive measurement; this is the one that
did, and it was not where I said it was.

## The defect

`merge-base.ts` had ONE message for every non-zero `regen` exit:

    if (regen.status !== 0) abort("the gate set could not reproduce the
      resolution (regen reported unrepaired checks)");

g5kt's whole achievement was making regen say which of three things happened
(`exitCodeFor`, four named reasons, code 2 for `not-settled`). Its only caller
then collapsed them back. The sentence is FALSE in three of the four cases:

- exit 2 `not-settled` — regen reported NO unrepaired check. It reported that
  it could not reach a fixed point, so it cannot stand behind the count it
  printed. Its own words: "this is NOT a clean regeneration".
- exit 1, every bad check `no-browser` — regen labels that could-not-determine
  in as many words: "not a finding about the tree, and it is not a pass either".
- exit 1 `no-writer` / `writer-failed` — a verdict about the TOOL, which is the
  distinction i1q7 exists to keep.
- any other code, or a signal — regen itself failed and nothing was measured;
  the message described that as a measurement.

The ABORT was right in every case: none of them may push. Only the recorded
reason was wrong.

## Why it is 1xhc's shape and not just bad wording

Two measured consequences, both now pinned by tests.

1. The abort line is the one place the reason is written down, and the PR
   comment is built from it. So a could-not-determine reached the PR's AUTHOR
   as "**Error** (exit N) — merge-base failed ...", asserting a defect in their
   branch where regen had either measured nothing or explicitly declined to
   judge.

2. The three verdicts shared ONE SIGNATURE. `no-browser` prints "  ? ..."
   which `SALIENT` does not match, and `not-settled` prints no "✗" line at
   all — so the identical abort sentence was the only salient line for each.
   `classifyVerdict` then read the second DISTINCT failure on one head as a
   `repeat` and suppressed its notification. A gate that does not fire is
   indistinguishable from one that passed, one layer out from where 1xhc
   usually bites.

## The general lesson, which is the part worth keeping

g5kt did not fail. g5kt's fix was UNDONE BY ITS CALLER, and nothing failed
when that happened, because a three-state verdict read through a
`!== 0` test is indistinguishable from a two-state one at the call site.
Every tool here that reports could-not-determine has callers, and this is the
first measurement of one of them. Worth asking of the others:
`merge-leftover` (3 verdicts), `regen` (4 outcomes + 3 exits), `survey:owed`
(4 states), `audit:coverage` (4 per-kind states), `check:ci-health`
(3 + cancelled). The question is not whether the tool distinguishes, it is
whether anything fails when a caller stops distinguishing.

## Done when

[x] merge-base names the verdict regen actually reported, per exit code
[x] the decode is a pure, exported, tested function living BESIDE `exitCodeFor`
    (`regenExitMeaning`), with a test asserting the two stay inverses over the
    codes `exitCodeFor` actually emits — built from `exitCodeFor`, so adding a
    verdict there fails in the decode's test
[x] exit 1 deliberately names all four kinds rather than picking one: the code
    cannot distinguish them, and asserting one would be this defect again
[x] the PR comment says "Could not determine" where regen could not determine
[x] the verdict crosses the module boundary through a DECLARED tag
    (`REGEN_VERDICT_TAG`), not matched prose, with a test pinning both ends and
    that the false sentence does not come back
[x] a test asserts the three verdicts no longer share one signature
[x] the five other could-not-determine tools above: does anything fail when a
    caller flattens them? MEASURED 2026-10-04 — see the census below


## Second instance, measured 2026-10-04 — `state:mount`

Found on PR #2074, on the line DIRECTLY ABOVE the one this bean fixes, added by
the PR that fixed the mount-before-merge defect:

    if (mount.status !== 0) abort("state:mount against the merged declarations failed");

`state-mount.ts:322` is

    process.exit(r.state === "failed" || r.state === "partial" ? 1 : 0);

so `partial` and `failed` share exit 1, and the abort records a partial mount as
a failure. The tool's own report text contradicts it in as many words — "a
partial mount is not a rollback, and nothing was discarded" — and lists what DID
mount so a reader does not conclude the whole mount is gone. The caller throws
that away.

The abort is right (do not push a tree whose graphs may not be mounted); the
recorded reason is wrong, which is this bean's shape exactly. `state:mount`
already takes `--json` and returns `r.state`, so the caller can name the state
without parsing prose.

Reported on #2074 rather than fixed here: it is that PR's own line and its
author's call. Not folded into #2086, which does not touch it.

TWO instances found in TWO modules, in one sitting, on adjacent lines — so the
unmeasured hand-off above is not hypothetical, and the next step is to look
rather than to reason about it.

## The census, measured 2026-10-04 — the defect is LOCALISED, not diffuse

I handed the general question on as unmeasured. It is cheap, so here it is.
Every subprocess call site in non-test code under `cat-harness/scripts` and
`cat-harness/src` that runs a multi-state tool:

| tool | states | subprocess callers | flattened? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `regen` | 3 exits + crash | 1 — `merge-base.ts` | YES — fixed, PR #2086 |
| `state:mount` | `partial` != `failed`, ONE exit | 1 — `merge-base.ts` | YES — reported on #2074 |
| `qa:resolve-conflicts` | 2 (0/1) | 1 — `merge-base.ts` | no: genuinely two-state |
| `merge:leftover` | 3 verdicts | 0 | n/a |
| `survey:owed` | 4 states | 0 | n/a |
| `audit:coverage` | 4 per-kind states | 0 (CI steps only) | n/a |
| `check:ci-health` | 3 + cancelled | 0 | n/a |

BOTH flatteners are in `merge-base.ts` and nowhere else. The four tools whose
could-not-determine discipline is most elaborate have NO subprocess caller at
all: they are run by a person or as a CI step, where the step's own red/green
is the whole contract and there is no caller to flatten anything.

So the risk is not spread across the could-not-determine tools. It is
concentrated in the one module that shells out to several of them, and it
appeared TWICE there within two days.

## Three correct handlers the repo already contains

Worth naming, because the fix is a pattern to copy rather than one to invent:

- `milestone-status.ts:332` branches on `status === 0`, `status === 1` and
  everything else separately; `:383` checks `status === null` for a signal.
- `qa-refresh.ts:309` carries `r.status` forward as `exit` rather than
  booleanising it, so the caller's caller still has the code.
- `check-published-packages.ts:308` names the exit code and GLOSSES the one
  that misleads — pytest's exit 5 becomes "COLLECTED NO TESTS" — rather than
  asserting a single cause. That is exactly the shape of #2086's fix, written
  before it.
- `detect-live-corpus.ts` booleanises one writer's exit, which is a real
  two-state question there, and still carries an explicit `undetermined` field
  for the case where the answer is not established.

## NOT proposing a gate, deliberately

The obvious next move is a check that refuses `!== 0` on a multi-state tool.
I am not proposing it, and the census is why: the whole population is seven
call sites, both defects were in one file, and such a gate would need a
DECLARATION of which tools are multi-state — a new declared list, kept by
hand, over a population small enough to read. That is more machinery than the
finding supports, and an unmaintained declaration is how `dh4f` happens.
What the finding does support: when `merge-base.ts` gains a shell-out to a
tool, check that tool's exit codes. Three good patterns to copy are named
above.
