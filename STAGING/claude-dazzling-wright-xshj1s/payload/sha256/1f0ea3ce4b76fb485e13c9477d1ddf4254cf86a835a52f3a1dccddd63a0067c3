The brief for an agent taking a **local, experimental** fork of the FHIR IG
Publisher, so that an AST can be emitted and cached.

## Which repositories, and why only one

| repository | holds | needed for |
|---|---|---|
| `HL7/fhir-ig-publisher` | orchestration, the loaded resources, **`DependencyAnalyser`**, `CqlSubSystem`, the metadata exports | the dump, the toolchain record, **the logic-layer dependency edges** |
| `hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core` | the renderer, the validator, dependency loading | **page-fragment provenance** only |

**Corrected 2026-09-30, by reading the code.** This skill said a
publisher-only fork could not satisfy the central requirement because the
logic-layer edges are produced in core. They are not.

- `DependencyAnalyser` is in the **publisher**
  (`org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/.../igtools/publisher/`). Its `analysePD` and
  `analyseAD` are empty stubs, and Library and Measure are not dispatched.
  That is the whole criterion-2 gap.
- `CqlSubSystem` already attaches CQL `depends-on` to each Library
  (`AdjunctFileLoader`), so Library→Library edges exist in memory; nothing
  exports them.

Only page-fragment provenance needs core. Read upstream before re-quoting
either claim: this one was wrong for a week and was served to every agent that
read the declaration.

## The shape taken: a library ON TOP, not a fork IN it

Owner, 2026-09-30: *"a library building on top... DO NOT change existing code,
unless absolutely have to. remarshal/reuse/sub-class"*. So the work is
`ast-export/`, a separate Maven project on branch `claude/ast-export` of
`litlfred/fhir-ig-publisher`. It depends on the **released**
`org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core` from Maven Central, is not a module of the root
pom, and changes no Publisher file.

- `AstPublisher extends Publisher` and overrides nothing. It reads
  `getFileList()` after `execute()`.
- `AstFieldsAccess` is a read-only view of package-private `PublisherFields`,
  declared in the Publisher's package **inside the library**. A rename
  upstream fails to compile rather than failing at run time.
- Upstream's `DependencyAnalyser` is **reused unchanged**; `LogicEdges` sits
  beside it.

That makes "behind a flag, default byte-identical" true by construction for
the Publisher itself: a stock build never loads the library. What still needs
measuring is that `AstExportCli`'s own build writes the same `output/` as a
stock one.

## The tools an agent runs

In the fork, under `ast-export/`:

| tool | what | network |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/run-real-igs.sh [work] [--byte-identical]` | W1/W2 on smart-trust and smart-immunizations, W2 per resource type | packages.fhir.org, tx.fhir.org |
| `scripts/w7-round.sh <work>` | one incremental round on a one-CQL-file change | same |
| `AstExportCli`, `AstPlanCli`, `IncrementalBuildCli` | export, plan a delta, rebuild the cone | export and rebuild: yes; plan: no |

Here, [`ig-ast-delta`](ig-ast-delta.md) lists, checks, diffs and renders what
those produce. Owner: **no GitHub Actions for now**, and any CI added later
**calls these same scripts**.

## Without packages.fhir.org: seeding the cache from trusted sources

Some environments reach GitHub and `registry.npmjs.org` but not
`packages.fhir.org` (this one, 2026-09-30). `ast-export/scripts/seed-fhir-cache-from-npm.py`
(Tool `fhir-cache-seed-npm`) fills the FHIR package cache from sources that
are each a **trust anchor**: named by the owner, or the package's own
publisher. Nothing else is consulted.

| source | trust | what it holds |
|---|---|---|
| npm, account `grahamegrieve` | **owner: trusted**. Grahame Grieve founded HL7 FHIR | mostly the latest version of each HL7 package; core packages under `@hl7/` |
| a publisher's own published-site repository on GitHub (the seeder's list) | the publisher's own published site | every released version that publisher hosts there |
| a template's own repo at HEAD | `FHIR/ig-registry/templates.json` names it; **owner: `fhir.base.template` is trusted** | templates, `#current` included |
| `--mirror` | whoever ran `mirror-fhir-packages.sh` (Tool `fhir-package-mirror`) | what the others lack |

Rules:

- **Exact versions only.** A pin is never satisfied by another version. The
  owner chose exact-only over an "approximate" build with substituted versions.
  The one exception is the Publisher's own rule: a patch wildcard (`1.1.x`)
  resolves to the highest `1.1.N` a source lists, and the resolution is
  recorded.
- **Verified.** npm tarballs against npm's sha512. Every other source must
  carry a `package/package.json` naming exactly the requested package and
  version. npm's `0.0.1-security` malicious-package placeholder is refused.
- **Nothing computed once and kept.** Owner, 2026-10-01: *"dynamically load
  from repos... dont calc once and assume fixed. avoid drift"*. The template
  registry, the IHE folder listing and any mirror clone are fetched fresh every
  run into a scratch directory deleted at exit. There is no table of package
  locations in the script that could go stale behind the registry.
- **Provenance** in `ast-export-npm-provenance.json`: the source, URL or
  commit, and hash of every package.

**Where it stands, measured 2026-10-01** over the two IGs bean `a9tx` measures: 20
packages install, including both templates. Missing are the pinned HL7
versions (IPS, terminology, extensions, CQL, CRMI, SDC, IPA), `fhir.cqf.common`
and `us.nlm.vsac`.

To close the gap:
1. Run the seeder with `--missing-out missing.txt`.
2. Run `mirror-fhir-packages.sh <repo> missing.txt` on a machine that reaches
   packages.fhir.org.
3. Run the seeder again with `--mirror <repo>`.

**A template the registry does not list** is named by the caller with
`--template-repo <name>=<owner/repo>`, on the command line, never stored. The
case met so far, and the upstream ask that would remove it, are in bean `a9tx`.

**The one fixed table** is the seeder's list of publishers' site
repositories, which maps a package-name prefix to the publisher's own GitHub
repo. It is fixed knowledge, so it can drift. That is tolerated only because
every package fetched through it must name itself exactly in its own
`package.json`, so a stale entry fails as "missing", never as a wrong
package. It lives in the fork, not in this layer: which publishers exist is
not something fhir-harness may know.

## The measurement that justifies the work

From bean `nsbb`, using the Publisher's current metadata exports as an AST
proxy across two real IGs:

| export | smart-trust | smart-immunizations |
|---|---|---|
| `valueset-ref-list.json` ValueSet→CodeSystem edges | 17 over 14 | 431 over 252 |
| `codesystem-ref-list.json` `uses` populated | 0 of 15 | 0 of 14 |
| `usage-stats.json` extension→path | 6 | 35 (+5 profiles) |

Two findings:

1. **`uses` is declared and never populated** — in *both* IGs.
2. **Nothing exports Library / PlanDefinition / Measure dependencies** — 458
   artefacts, **61 % of smart-immunizations**, the decision-logic core, with
   zero edges.

Re-derive both before quoting them. They are the reason for the fork; if a
later Publisher release closes either, the fork's scope shrinks accordingly and
that is a good outcome, not a wasted brief.

## Acceptance criteria

The AST must carry:

- [ ] **one structured record per resource**, keyed by canonical URL *and*
      version — an id alone collides across versions
- [ ] **dependency edges among Library, PlanDefinition and Measure** — the gap
      above. Built as `LogicEdges`; **not yet measured** on smart-immunizations
- [ ] **`uses` actually populated**, or an explicit statement that it cannot be
      — a declared-and-empty field is worse than an absent one, because a
      consumer cannot tell "no dependencies" from "not computed"
- [ ] **page-fragment provenance** — which source produced which output
      fragment, so a rendered page can be traced without re-running
- [ ] **the resolved dependency closure with pinned versions**
- [ ] **terminology expansion provenance** — which server, which version, and
      whether expansion actually happened; a build against a dead `tx` must be
      distinguishable from an IG with thin ValueSets
- [ ] **a `toolchain` object** — publisher version, core version, SUSHI
      version. `publisher.jar` is re-downloaded from the *latest* release on
      every WHO build, so without this an AST cannot say what produced it

And the fork itself must satisfy:

- [ ] **emitted behind a flag**, with default behaviour byte-identical when the
      flag is absent
- [ ] **upstreamable shape** — a flag and an additional writer, not a rewrite.
      A fork that cannot be offered back is a maintenance burden with no exit,
      and this one is explicitly *experimental*
- [ ] **no change to validation or rendering semantics.** If a fork build's
      `qa.json` differs from an upstream build's on the same input, that is a
      defect in the fork, and it is the first thing to check

## What the agent must not do

- **Do not treat the AST as an authority.** It is a cache: its indices,
  dependency edges and versions are unverified until a full run. Anything
  written to consume it says so — see
  [`ig-publisher-reduction`](ig-publisher-reduction.md) §P3.
- **Do not vendor either repository into this one.** The fork lives at its own
  remote. `toolchain-ownership`'s cutover rule is the general form: after a
  move, exactly one repository runs a thing.
- **Do not add WHO, DAK or SMART concepts to the fork.** The AST is a property
  of a FHIR IG. A DAK-shaped field in it makes the fork unofferable upstream
  and re-imports the layering violation `fhir-harness` exists to prevent.
- **Do not fix `uses` by inferring it.** If the information is not there,
  report that it is not there. An inferred edge in a dependency graph is
  indistinguishable from a real one downstream, and every ordering metric
  computed from it becomes unfalsifiable — the same argument `uses[]` carries
  on the editorial side.

## Reporting

A fork round reports: which repositories at which commits, which criteria are
met, which are not, and **what was measured rather than what was implemented**.
A criterion is met when an AST from a real IG is shown to carry the thing —
smart-immunizations is the right subject, because it is the IG whose 61 % gap
motivated the work.
