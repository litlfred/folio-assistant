## The defect, in one line

`ranAs` matches a run on **name and event** and never reads its `conclusion`:

```ts
function ranAs(runs: RunRow[], t: WorkflowTrigger, event: string): boolean {
  return runs.some((r) => r.name === t.name && r.event === event);
}
```

`RunRow` already carries `conclusion`. The data was in hand and not consulted.

A `pull_request` run that completes **`action_required`** was created and
**never executed**: no job ran, no gate was evaluated. It satisfies
`ranAs` anyway, so `coverageFor` reports `ran: true` and the CLI prints
`✓ all N workflow(s) owed for `pull_request` ran`.

This is the direct sequel to bean `9x9r`, which fixed *"a run of the wrong
event counts"*. Same shape one field over: **a run that did not run counts.**
`9x9r`'s own docblock states the intent this violates — *"{@link runsForHead}
answers 'is there a run', which is a strictly weaker question than **did the
gates fire**"*.

## Measured 2026-10-03, on the two heads the merge sweep flagged

`bun run check:head-has-run c975c7da7b9b1ce32e3466abd1028e29e34dbb29` (#1819):

```
  c975c7da7b — 5 run(s):
    Code-quality gates                   pull_request     action_required
    Feature Staging (GitHub Pages)       pull_request     action_required
    JSON-LD generated-file drift         pull_request     action_required
    JSON-LD generated-file drift         workflow_dispatch success
    Code-quality gates                   workflow_dispatch failure

✓ c975c7da7b — all 1 workflow(s) owed for `pull_request` ran.      exit 0
```

**Exit 0 on a head that is both unverified AND red.** The only run that
executed `Code-quality gates` at all is the `workflow_dispatch` one, and it
**failed**. `#1808` (`ead7c138ab`) is the same shape with a passing dispatch.

So the ✓ is not merely optimistic: it is printed over a *failure* that is
visible two lines above it in the script's own output.

## Why the ✗ cannot simply be "missing"

Three states must stay apart, and folding `action_required` into the existing
`missing` set would lose the one that tells the operator what to do:

| state | means | remedy |
|---|---|---|
| **ran** | a `pull_request` run executed | read its conclusion |
| **blocked** | a `pull_request` run exists and **never executed** | NOT a dropped event. Nothing to wait for and nothing to dispatch-fix |
| **absent** | no such run at all | the three `3pqn` / `52cz` causes |

`missingRequiredAdvice`'s `mergeable` branch says *"their absence is
unexplained (bean `3pqn`)"* and *"Dispatching against this ref is safe HERE"*.
Both sentences are **false for a blocked run**: its absence IS explained, and a
dispatch is what has been masking the problem rather than fixing it. Printing
`3pqn`'s advice here is the hazard this file has twice been fixed for — giving
advice that makes things worse.

## Root cause of the `action_required` itself — confirmed, not inferred

Bean `0qjq` recorded it as a hypothesis from `merge-main.yml`'s comment. Now
measured directly, on both heads, via
`actions/runs?head_sha=<sha>` → `actor.login` / `triggering_actor.login`:

| | |
|---|---|
| every `action_required` run's `actor` and `triggering_actor` | `github-actions[bot]` |
| `head.repo.fork` | `false` — **not** an outside-contributor gate |
| `head.repo.full_name` | `litlfred/folio-assistant` |
| PR author | `litlfred` — so actor ≠ author |

The bot-actor diagnosis in `merge-main.yml` is **confirmed**. The fix is the
one already named in `0qjq` and issue **#1829 D1** — a push credential whose
pushes trigger the PR's own runs (`MERGE_MAIN_TOKEN`, proposed rename
`PUSH_BRANCH_TRIGGERING_CI`). `merge-main.yml` already carries the
`HAS_TOKEN` branch, so **setting the secret is the whole change** — and it is
the owner's to make, not a code change.

## Done when

- [ ] `coverageFor` reports `blocked` distinctly from `ran` and from `absent`
- [ ] the CLI exits non-zero on a blocked required run
- [ ] the advice for `blocked` names the bot-actor cause and does NOT recommend
      a hand dispatch
- [x] `check:prs-have-runs` stops calling an all-blocked head `has-run` —
      but see the CORRECTION below: that is NOT the #1819 shape, and this
      box as originally written overclaimed
- [ ] tests over every new branch

## A fifth state, NAMED but deliberately NOT built

Raised by the Merge Manager 2026-10-03, and recorded here rather than
implemented, because it is a different mechanism rather than another reading of
`conclusion`.

> a green on step 65 does not mean it was never broken — "passed" and "passed
> because somebody else's regenerate happened to land first" are not the same
> evidence.

**Their measurement:** `Code-quality gates` step 65, *"Every declared
directory's README is current"*, was red on `main` itself — `8688288494a`,
`268c0911a06`, `70882785607` — from one stale generated file (`uploads/README.md`,
six PDFs added with no rows). It was repaired **by accident, three times in two
hours**, by unrelated PRs whose own `readme:subgraphs` run happened to land
first. The last time on the Merge Manager's own PR while writing up the first two.

**Independent confirmation from this branch**, which is the cheap half:
`readme:subgraphs:check` on this branch's tree reports **0 stale**, while the
same step fails on its `pull_request` run. A `pull_request` run tests the head
merged with `main`, so the failure is entirely the BASE's — the
`github-state-inspection` rule *"ask whether the BASE moved before calling any
verdict non-deterministic"*, arriving as a gate that is red for a reason the
branch cannot see or fix.

**Why it is not built here.** This bean's states are all readable from a run
object: `conclusion` says whether the run executed. "Was this gate green on its
own merits, or repaired under it" is not in the run at all — answering it needs
the history of the generated file and which commit last touched it. Adding a
fifth state on a guess would be the failure
[`audit-coverage`](../../cat-harness/skills/kg/kg-core/audit-coverage.md) names:
a measurement must not become a term in itself. So it is written down with its
evidence and left for the owner to scope.

It is bean `1xhc`'s shape one level above a single gate, and the reason it
belongs on this bean rather than a new one is that both are the same sentence:
**a gate that did not judge you is indistinguishable from one that passed.**

## CORRECTION — the sweep half does NOT catch #1819 or #1808

Measured 2026-10-03 by running the thing rather than reasoning about it:
`bun run check:prs-have-runs --min-age-minutes 0`

```
  ✓ #1819  has-run   Glass strip: pinned tiles first, "+N more", hidden until
  ✓ #1808  has-run   Theme sidebar takes the viewer rail's layout: one scroll
```

**Still `has-run`, after the fix.** The `## Done when` box above claimed
*"`check:prs-have-runs` stops calling an all-blocked head `has-run`"* and the
first draft of PR #1942 said the sweep *"marked both heads ✓ has-run"* as though
this change addressed it. It does not, and the claim was wrong.

**Why.** `anyExecuted` asks whether ANY run at the head executed, and these
heads carry `workflow_dispatch` runs that **did** execute. So they are not
all-blocked. The `blocked` state fires only when *every* run at the head failed
to execute, which is a narrower shape than the one this bean was filed about.

**What the change is actually worth**, stated without inflation: it closes the
all-blocked case, and it stops the sweep's `clean` verdict being vacuously
satisfied by run objects that never ran. That is real and tested. It is not the
#1819 shape.

**Why it was not then extended to the owed event.** That question —
*did a run of the event the PR OWES execute* — is `coverageFor`'s, and
`coverageFor` already answers it correctly (the event match predates this bean,
from `9x9r`). `check:head-has-run` and `ci:watch` compose it and both now
report these two heads as findings, verified: exit **1**, `! Code-quality gates
required — DID NOT EXECUTE`. Teaching the broad sweep to answer the same
question a second way, in an unattended CI job, is the *"two answers to one
question are free to disagree"* failure that
[`github-state-inspection`](../../cat-harness/skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/github-state-inspection.md)
§"A clean check set and a COMPLETE check set are different questions" names
explicitly — *"Do not build a second reconciliation"*. The sweep's own docblock
scopes it to *"no CI run of any kind"*, and that scope is deliberate: it is a
cheap pass over every open PR, where the per-head tool does the reconciliation.

**So the honest split**, and the thing a reader of this bean needs:

| question | instrument | #1819 verdict |
|---|---|---|
| is there any CI on this head? | `check:prs-have-runs` | ✓ yes (a dispatch ran) — and that is TRUE |
| did the gates the PR owes execute? | `check:head-has-run`, `ci:watch` | ✗ **no** — exit 1 |

Reading the first as the second is the whole of bean `1xhc`. The sweep is not
the instrument for a merge decision, and nothing here makes it one.

PR #1942 opened and pushed (4 commits). Blocked on #1946 for a base-side step-65 red that is not this diff. Not merging; the Merge Manager merges.

DONE 2026-10-03. PR #1942 green on ffa5b2e66e5 (12 checks, 0 red), labelled ready-to-merge, not merged by this session. Root cause confirmed as measurement (bot actor, non-fork); one config change (#1829 D1) un-blocks 2 of 33 PRs, NOT the 15 conflicted ones -- there is no single fix, stated plainly.
