Findings from the as-is wireframe `cat-harness/docs/wireframes/library/` (intent.md, as-is.html, checks/), observed at 1280×800 and 390×844. Verbatim from its `## Findings`; a finding tagged → is also covered by that cross-cutting bug.

1. **Five columns are off-screen even at desktop width.** The page action is now reachable: "Pull out to folio" moved to the first cell, so finding 1 of the earlier drawing (the action past the right edge) is fixed. But the first cell is now 391 px and does not wrap, and the table has grown to 1820 px. At 1280 px **Pages**, **Words**, **Size**, **Referenced by** and **Source** are past the right edge of the scroll box, and nothing on screen shows there is more to the right.
2. **On a phone the listing is one column.** At 390 px only the first cell is in view: the cover, the slug and the pull-out button. Title, words, size, OCR and source, the metadata the listing exists to show, all need a sideways scroll inside a box. The uploads table shows only "Unit" at 390 px. (→ `folio-assistant-2r2n`)
3. **The fixed Folio handle covers the page title on a phone.** At 390 px the `▾ Folio` button sits over "Library — the L1 corpus" (it reads "Library — th… ▾ Folio …s"). At 1280 px it clears the title. (→ `folio-assistant-015u`)
4. **Entries cannot be opened.** Neither the slug, the title nor the cover is a link, in either view. Rows and cards carry a `data-fa-library-href`, but nothing on the page lets a reader reach an entry's sections or source. (→ `folio-assistant-qgjh`)
5. **The titles shown are extraction artefacts.** "Abies" is the title shown for `who-pub-tps-931` (the WHO editorial style manual, per the uploads table). "PUBLICATION AND INFORMATION" is cut short, and "Handbook forGuideline" is missing a space. The same text is also the pull-out button's accessible name ("Pull Abies out to your folio glass"). At 34 × 46 px the cover is too small to settle what an entry is, so the reader still has to cross-check against the uploads table.
6. **"Referenced by" details are in a `title` tooltip only.** The pill "1 catalogue, 1 voices" puts the referencing file paths in its `title` attribute, which touch and keyboard users cannot reach.

When fixed, re-draw `cat-harness/docs/wireframes/library/` and re-run `bun run wireframe:check` and `bun run check:wireframes`.

## Re-verified 2026-09-29 on `main` 35402147f

Each finding re-measured on a local build of that commit, at 1280×800 and 390×844, both colour schemes where contrast is involved. 5 still present, 1 fixed, 0 could not be determined. FIXED means observed on the built page, not read from code.

- **STILL-PRESENT** — Five columns off-screen even at desktop width, no cue: 1280x800: the table is 1820 px wide in section.wrap (1224 px, overflow-x auto); first cell 391 px. th pages/words/size/referenced by/source start at x>=1327 (OFF) and OCR is PART. The wrap has mask-image none and box-shadow none, so there is no edge cue.
- **STILL-PRESENT** — On a phone the listing is one column (uploads shows only Unit): 390x844: box 334 px wide; only the 'slug' th is in view (56-447, partial); title..source are all OFF. Uploads table: only 'unit' is partly visible. A right-edge fade mask (linear-gradient, 40 px) is now present at 390, but the content is unchanged.
- **FIXED** — Fixed Folio handle covers the page title on a phone: 390x844: button.fa-glass-handle is at rect top 0..28, left 149..241; h1 'Library — the L1 corpus' is at top 52..81. No overlap, confirmed in a screenshot. At 1280 the handle is at 594-686, 0-28, also clear. — candidate
- **STILL-PRESENT** — Entries cannot be opened: All 3 rows carry data-fa-library-href but 0 <a> elements; tr tabIndex -1, cursor auto; the cover img is not in a link. Clicking the title cell changes neither the URL nor the page height, and opens no dialog.
- **STILL-PRESENT** — Titles shown are extraction artefacts (Abies, PUBLICATION AND INFORMATION, Handbook forGuideline): Row titles are still 'Handbook forGuideline Development 2nd edition', 'Abies' and 'PUBLICATION AND INFORMATION'. Button aria-label: 'Pull Abies out to your folio glass'. Cover img is 32x44 px.
- **STILL-PRESENT** — 'Referenced by' details in a title tooltip only: The pill span '1 catalogue, 1 voices' holds its paths only in the title attribute ('who-iris/catalogue/nodes/item-...json (1)\nwho-style-guide/skills/...'). tabIndex is -1 and it is not in a <details>.

Each finding re-measured on a local build of that commit (`preview-site.sh`, served at `/folio-assistant/`), at 1280×800 and 390×844, both colour schemes where contrast is involved. 4 still present, 2 fixed, 0 could not be determined. FIXED means observed on the built page, not read from code.

- **STILL-PRESENT** — Five columns off-screen even at desktop width, no cue: 1280×800: the table is 1820px wide in section.wrap (1224px, overflow-x auto), and the first cell is 391px. 'ocr' is PART, and pages/words/size/referenced by/source start at x≥1327 (OFF). The wrap has mask-image none and box-shadow none. (C_lib.mjs, C_lib2.mjs)
- **STILL-PRESENT** — On a phone the listing is one column (uploads shows only Unit): 390×844: the box is 334px wide. Only 'slug' is in view (56–447, PART), and title..source are all OFF. In the uploads table only 'unit' is partly visible. The 40px right-edge fade mask on the table is still the only cue. (C_lib.mjs, C_lib2.mjs)
- **FIXED** — Fixed Folio handle covers the page title on a phone: Still fixed. The h1 'Library — the L1 corpus' is at top 52–81, and the handle is at 0–28, so there is no overlap at either width. (C_lib.mjs)
- **FIXED** — Entries cannot be opened: Changed since 2026-09-29. Each of the 3 rows' title cell is now an <a> to the item's README on GitHub (e.g. who-iris/library/9789241548960-eng/README.md). Clicking the title navigates away. The row still has tabIndex −1, and slug and cover are not links. On /cat-harness/library/cat-harness/ 11 of 11 titles link, plus 7 'source' links. — #1592 (C_lib.mjs, C_lib2.mjs, qgjh.mjs)
- **STILL-PRESENT** — Titles shown are extraction artefacts (Abies, PUBLICATION AND INFORMATION, Handbook forGuideline): The titles are still 'Handbook forGuideline Development 2nd edition', 'Abies' and 'PUBLICATION AND INFORMATION'. The button aria-label is 'Pull Abies out to your folio glass'. The cover img is 32×44px. (C_lib.mjs)
- **STILL-PRESENT** — 'Referenced by' details in a title tooltip only: The pill span '1 catalogue, 1 voices' holds its paths only in the title attribute. It is not focusable and not in a <details>. (C_lib.mjs)

Claimed by claude/visualiser-wireframes (session https://claude.ai/code/session_01CVVoavPoCHMLA7AASxG8cH) — issue #1838.

## Summary of Changes

Worked on claude/visualiser-wireframes (PR #1839, issue #1838). Re-measured on main cf3e62487 at 1280×800 and 390×844. Pictures are in cat-harness/docs/wireframes/library/rendered-2026-10-02/, and the per-finding record is in that wireframe's intent.md.

1. Fixed. Long cells wrap: the table goes from 3636 px to 1552 px at 1280. The first column is pinned and a right-edge fade cues the overflow.
2. Fixed. Below 800 px each row is a labelled two-column card, and the uploads table is treated the same way. scrollWidth is 390.
3. No longer holds (recorded fixed 2026-09-29, re-confirmed).
4. No longer holds (#1592): titles are links.
5. Fixed for the named entries: a catalogue title (libraryId) outranks the extracted one, which is kept as extractedTitle. Still open: entries with no catalogue node, and the cover size (owner question on the PR).
6. Fixed. 'Referenced by' is a <details>, not a title tooltip.

Generators: cat-harness/scripts/gen-library-viz.ts and cat-harness/scripts/library-graph.ts (plus the schema in site-indexes.ts).
