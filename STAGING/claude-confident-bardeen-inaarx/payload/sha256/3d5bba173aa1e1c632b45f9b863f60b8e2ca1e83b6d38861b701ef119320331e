Measured 2026-09-30 on origin/main 0d2ec884c (worktree for g9r2): every gate passed, then gates.ts failed the run because `bun test` wrote `cat-harness/content/pipeline/script-sidecars/proof-compile-cost.script.json` and `proof-no-cost-regression.script.json`. The diff: `source_file` now reads `folio-assistant-sci/content/pipeline/qa-checkers-cost.ts` (the checker moved there), and `last_run_at`/`last_run_sha` are re-stamped. So the committed sidecars are stale against the move, AND a test writes into the tree under test, which gates.ts calls the defect (bean ymsu). Fix: regenerate and commit the two sidecars; then find the test that writes them and make it compute into a temp dir.

## Closed on evidence, 2026-09-30 (session https://claude.ai/code/session_01SiFEMuTciyB681XP5WfcbB)

Both halves had already landed; this closure only re-derives them.
- **The stale sidecars:** `proof-compile-cost.script.json`'s `source_file` on main already reads `folio-assistant-sci/content/pipeline/qa-checkers-cost.ts`.
- **The test that wrote into the tree:** the two tests that run the real QA sweep are both redirected. `profile-scoping.test.ts` passes `--dry-run`; `init-folio-qa.test.ts` passes `--script-sidecar-root <tmp>`.

**Falsified:** a full `bun test` on a clean checkout of main (13,110 pass) left `git status` **empty**. There were 2 failures, both environmental: `head-has-run`'s known timeout, and the distortion check refusing that worktree's symlinked `node_modules`. Neither writes.
