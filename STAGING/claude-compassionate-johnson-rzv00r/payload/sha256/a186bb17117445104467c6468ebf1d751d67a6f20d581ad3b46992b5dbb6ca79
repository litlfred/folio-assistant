## CORRECTED 2026-09-26 — the cause is NOT `ymsu`, and the title understates it

This bean was opened saying *"a sweep artefact"* and pointing at `ymsu` — a
gate that writes what a later gate reads. **That was wrong**, and it was a
hypothesis stated in a bean's title as though it were the finding. The actual
cause is a one-character `.gitignore` bug that distorts the CORPUS of every
worktree `check:merged` builds.

Both are kept here rather than the wrong one edited away: the wrong hypothesis
is why the first three probes proved nothing, and that is the reusable lesson.

## What was actually measured

`.gitignore` line 1 read `node_modules/`. **Git's trailing slash means
DIRECTORY ONLY.** `check:merged` symlinks the checkout's `node_modules` into
its throwaway worktree to avoid a second install — and a symlink is not a
directory, so there the path was not ignored,
`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` returned it, and `gitCorpus` handed
every consumer **one phantom entry**.

On commit `0d3c49c8`, same tree, two environments:

| environment | corpus paths | `kg:detangle:check` |
|---|---|---|
| real checkout (`node_modules` a directory) | **13666** | ✓ 29 pinned current |
| worktree (`node_modules` a symlink) | **13667** | ✗ **5 STALE** |

`comm` on the two sorted lists differs by exactly one line: `node_modules`.
Removing the trailing slash took the corpus to 13666 and the stale set from
five files to one.

So `check:merged` reported two unrelated branches' merged trees defective when
no real checkout of either was — #1392 and #1395, within one hour, which is
what opened this bean.

## The three probes that proved nothing, and why

Recorded because the method is the lesson, not the result.

1. `uml:overview:check` alone on the merged tree, in `/tmp/probe2` → green.
2. The same on `/tmp/mrg` → green.
3. `kg:audit` then `uml:overview:check` → writes nothing, still green.

Every one of those worktrees ALSO symlinked `node_modules`, so they carried
the same distortion; they differed from `check:merged` in **two** ways at once
(directory NAME and single-check vs full sweep) and therefore discriminated
between nothing. `check-merged.ts`'s own docblock says the worktree is named
`…/folio-assistant` because tests assert that name — reading that is what
exposed the flaw in the probes.

The probe that worked held everything fixed but the environment: the **same
commit** in the real checkout versus a correctly-named worktree. And the
control that clinched it: pristine `origin/main` in a worktree is red the same
way, with a SUPERSET of the same files, so the staleness was never the merge's.

## What was NOT claimed

One residual is unexplained and deliberately not attributed: with the fix
applied to a clean probe tree, `cat-harness/skills/scientific-critical-thinking.detangle.json — proseMentions`
still reads STALE in a worktree while the real checkout at that commit is
green. Four of the five files are accounted for; this one is not. Naming a
cause for it would repeat the mistake this bean was opened with.

## Done when

- [x] The cause is identified by measurement rather than hypothesis — corpus
      diff between the two environments, one entry, `node_modules`.
- [x] `.gitignore` ignores `node_modules` whether it is a directory or a
      symlink.
- [x] A test pins it **at the corpus level**, in a scratch repo where the
      defect can actually occur (this repo's `node_modules` is a real
      directory, so the bug is invisible here), with the control that keeps it
      from passing vacuously —
      `cat-harness/scripts/tests/git-corpus-symlinked-deps.test.ts`.
      Falsified: restoring the trailing slash fails it and passes the control.
- [x] `check:merged` verifies its own environment BEFORE sweeping, and a
      distorted corpus is **exit 2, could not determine** — never a red. A
      false refusal from a tool whose job is to refuse teaches everyone to
      stop running it. Falsified against a genuinely defective `HEAD`: exit 2
      with the reason, no sweep.
- [ ] The residual `proseMentions` discrepancy above: find what else differs
      between a real checkout and a worktree at the same commit.
- [ ] Re-run `check:merged` on the two recorded trees (`d698d151`,
      `240f0953`) once the fix is on `main`, and confirm both go green. A fix
      verified only forwards is `1xhc`.

_2026-09-26T12:24:17Z_ — Claimed by claude/fx5r-close — pushed to main so sibling sessions see it before this branch has a PR (bean 35nj).


## 2026-09-27 — the original cause IS fixed, and a SECOND cause of the same false report is not

The two open boxes, worked from an undistorted checkout (`node_modules` a real
directory) against a worktree pinned to the SAME commit with `node_modules`
symlinked — the exact pair of environments the bean is about.

### The residual `proseMentions` discrepancy: RESOLVED

`cat-harness/test/results/detangle/cat-harness/skills/scientific-critical-thinking.detangle.json`,
**recomputed** with `bun run kg:detangle` in each environment:

| | proseMentions |
|---|---|
| real checkout | 15 |
| symlinked worktree | 15 |

and the whole sidecar byte-identical afterwards. Corpus size likewise **14215
in both**.

**Method note worth more than the result.** My first attempt compared the
COMMITTED sidecar in the two trees and got 15 = 15. That measured nothing —
same commit, same bytes, agreement guaranteed. A comparison between two
checkouts of one commit is vacuous unless the value is RECOMPUTED in each. It
looked exactly like diligence.

### The `check:merged` box: NOT satisfied, and for a new reason

Run from the symlinked worktree, the guard behaved: no exit 2, no
"could not determine", straight to `running bun run gates on the merged tree`.
So `.gitignore`-without-the-slash did fix what this bean identified.

But `check:merged` still exits **1** on the merged tree, and the reason is not
staleness:

```
✗ every gate passed, and the run is NOT clean — 1 gate(s) changed the tree.
  167 verdict(s) above were reached against a tree that a gate had already
  repaired, so the later ones describe a state you have not committed.

✗ the MERGED tree fails the gates, though this branch may pass alone.
Merge the base into the branch, regenerate what the failing gates name, ...
```

**Every gate passed. No gate failed. There is nothing to regenerate.** The
advice is unactionable, and the first line is false as written.

`check-merged.ts:160` branches on `gates.status !== 0` and nothing else, so it
cannot distinguish "a gate failed" from "every gate passed but a gate wrote to
the tree" (`ymsu`, measured the same day at 72 `script-sidecars/` paths).

**This is this bean’s own title restated** — *reports a merged tree defective
when no real checkout of it is* — reached by a second, independent route. The
first route is closed; this one is open. So the box stays UNCHECKED.

### Also not satisfied, and not satisfiable as written

The box says re-run on the two recorded trees `d698d151` and `240f0953`. The
bean records the tree hashes but **not the (branch, base) pair** they were
produced from, and a tree object alone does not reconstruct the merge that made
it. A literal replay is therefore not available to a later reader. What IS
verified is the cause, in the distorted environment, which is strictly what the
`1xhc` parent asks for; the literal replay is not.

**Lesson for the next bean that records a tree hash: record the inputs, not
just the output.** A hash you cannot regenerate is evidence you cannot re-check.

### The fix I did NOT make, because it is the owner’s

`gates.ts` already reserves exit **2** for "could not tell" (line 1135), and the
mutation path at 1232 takes exit **1**. Its own comment argues the case for 2:
*"their passing is a verdict about a state the repository does not contain."*
This bean makes the same argument for its own guard — *a distorted corpus is
exit 2, never a red; a false refusal from a tool whose job is to refuse teaches
everyone to stop running it.*

So the one-line candidate is: that path exits 2, and `check:merged` — which
already treats 2 as could-not-determine — reports it correctly with no change
of its own.

Not done unilaterally. It changes a gate’s exit-code contract, which affects
every CI consumer, and the author reasoned about exit 2 deliberately right
next to it (*"I know exactly which steps are missing is not I could not
tell"*). `jh2j`’s exit-2 contract is already an owner item; this belongs with
it.


## 2026-09-27 — the two fixes for THIS bean now contradict each other, and `check:merged` cannot pass

Measured on `origin/main` at `b9e066ef3e7`, twice.

`qook`'s fix was to make the symlink **invisible to git** — drop `.gitignore`'s
trailing slash, so `gitCorpus` stops returning the phantom entry. That addressed
the actual mechanism and left the symlink in place, which is what
`check-merged.ts:151` needs: it symlinks the checkout's `node_modules` into its
throwaway worktree to avoid a second install, and its own comment (35 lines,
citing this bean) explains why that is correct.

`check-environment.ts:278`, hardened in #1447 and corrected in #1466, now
**refuses outright** when the root `node_modules` is a symlink — citing this
same bean. `gates.ts` runs `check:environment` first, so:

    check:merged  ->  builds worktree  ->  symlinks node_modules (by design)
                  ->  runs gates       ->  check:environment REFUSES (exit 2)
                  ->  reports "the MERGED tree fails the gates"

**Two independent runs, both refusing before any gate ran:**

| environment | root `node_modules` | `check:environment` alone | `check:merged` |
|---|---|---|---|
| this checkout, branch merged with main | real directory | **rc=0**, "not distorting a reading" | **exit 1**, "REFUSING TO RUN" |
| pristine `origin/main` worktree | (control) | — | **exit 1**, same message |

The first row is the decisive one: the checkout's own environment is clean and
`check:environment` says so, yet `check:merged` refuses from inside it. The
refusal is generated by `check-merged`'s own symlink, not by the caller's tree.

**Scope, stated precisely rather than as "always".** The refusal follows the
symlink BRANCH, `check-merged.ts:143`. It is taken when the merge leaves
`bun.lock` alone and `node_modules` exists — the normal fast path. When the
lockfile changed or `node_modules` is absent, `check-merged` runs
`bun install --frozen-lockfile` instead, producing a real directory, and the
guard passes. So the common case is broken and the uncommon one is not, which is
worse than uniformly broken: it will look intermittent.

## Why this is the interesting failure rather than a typo

The guard is **broader than the defect it cites**. The phantom corpus entry came
from git's directory-only pattern, not from the symlink as such — nothing about a
symlinked `node_modules` makes a *reading* wrong once git ignores it, which is
why this repository's own pre-push tool depends on one. So the guard bans a
sanctioned mechanism in the name of the bean whose fix established it.

And it is exactly the failure `check-merged`'s own comment warns against, in its
words: *"a false refusal from a tool whose job is to refuse teaches everyone to
stop running it, and then it is not there for the merge it exists for."* The
guard's own PR made the same argument in the other direction — #1466 loosened
equality to `major.minor` because *"a false positive on a clean tree is the worse
failure and the one I built the guard to avoid."*

## Not fixed here, and what the fix has to decide

Left for the owner because it is a judgement about which mechanism is sanctioned,
not a repair. The shapes, in the order I would try them:

1. `check-environment` distinguishes a symlink whose target is **inside this
   repository** (what `check-merged` creates) from one pointing elsewhere. Keeps
   both guards, narrowest change, and the `lstat` is already there.
2. `check-merged` stops symlinking and always installs. Correct and slow; pays a
   full install on every pre-push check.
3. `check-merged` passes an explicit "I built this environment" signal. Cheapest,
   and the worst: an escape hatch on a guard is the thing that gets set by
   whoever is in a hurry.

**Consequence until then:** `check:merged` cannot be used as the pre-push gate,
so a branch must be verified with `bun run gates` on a merged working tree
instead. That is what I did for the `groupDepthFor` change — and it is strictly
weaker, because it measures MY checkout rather than a freshly built one.
