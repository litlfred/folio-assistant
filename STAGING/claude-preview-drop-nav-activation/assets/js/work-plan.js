/**
 * The work-plan dashboard — what a harness instance's state graphs HOLD.
 *
 * ## One file, two surfaces, and that is the point
 *
 * This renderer is served two ways and exists once:
 *
 *   - the docs site loads it as a `<script>` beside `docs-ui.js`, and it
 *     mounts into the `beans-and-todos` page's container;
 *   - `scripts/state-visualizer.ts` INLINES these exact bytes into every
 *     generated visualiser page, so `<base>/<stub>/state-visualizer/` needs no
 *     network fetch for its own code.
 *
 * It lived inside `docs-ui.js` for one commit. Moving it out is what stops the
 * second surface becoming a second copy — and a second copy of a renderer is
 * two answers to "what does the work plan look like", free to disagree while
 * both look right in review.
 *
 * ## It self-mounts, so neither surface has to remember to call it
 *
 * Any page carrying `[data-fa-workplan]` gets a dashboard. A page without one
 * pays a single failed `querySelector`. `docs-ui.js` does not call in here and
 * does not need to know it exists.
 *
 * ## No dependencies, no CDN, no build step
 *
 * The same rule `kg-viewer.ts` states for its own page: a view of this
 * repository's data must be openable from a file, reviewable offline, and must
 * not add a third party to its own trust boundary.
