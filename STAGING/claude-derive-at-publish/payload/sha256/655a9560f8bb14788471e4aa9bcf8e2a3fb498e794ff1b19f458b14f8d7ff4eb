Measured 2026-09-26, by building the package rather than by reading about it.

`@litlfred/block-qa-schema` is the **only** package in this repository that
ships to npm. It is named in no `.github/workflows/*.yml`, and the root
`package.json` declares no `workspaces`, so its devDependencies had never been
installed on a runner and its `build` and `test` scripts had never run. Its
`node_modules/` did not exist in a fresh checkout.

## The cost, paid rather than predicted

[PR #914](https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/pull/914) bumped its
`typescript` from 5.9.3 to **7.0.2** and passed **ten** CI checks — not one of
which read the file it changed. It merged. The package was then unbuildable:

    TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
      (reading 'useCaseSensitiveFileNames')

**With the control, because a single failure names no cause:**

| `typescript` | `bun run build` |
|---|---|
| 5.9.3 (pre-bump) | **success** — ESM, CJS and DTS |
| 6.x | fails — `error occurred in dts build` |
| 7.0.2 (merged) | fails — the `TypeError` above |

And the fourth measurement, which is the one that decides the fix: **TypeScript
7's own `tsc` emits these declarations without complaint.** So the bump is not
the defect. `tsup --dts` is: it delegates to `rollup-plugin-dts`, which bundles
its own TypeScript 5.7.3 and reaches into compiler internals TypeScript 7
changed.

## Fixed here

- The package **owns its compiler settings** — a `tsconfig.json` of its own.
  It had none, so `tsc` walked up and found the PLATFORM's, a config written
  for a Bun application (`types: [bun-types]`, `allowImportingTsExtensions`)
  and never for something that ships `.d.ts` to npm. Inheriting by
  directory-walk accident is not configuration.
- `build` emits declarations with `tsc -p tsconfig.json` instead of
  `tsup --dts`. The owner's TypeScript 7 decision stands; the toolchain moved.
- `check:published-packages` builds every publishable package git accounts
  for, wired into `code-quality-gates.yml`. The set is DERIVED, and an **empty
  set fails** — a sweep that examined nothing has cleared nothing.

Verified end to end, not by exit code alone: CJS and ESM each load with 12
exports, and a consumer type-checks clean against the emitted `.d.ts`. The gate
was verified by BREAKING it — restoring `--dts` fails it, exit 1, and the
restored script passes, exit 0.

## Done when

- [x] The package builds under the TypeScript that is actually pinned.
- [x] A gate builds it, so the next bump cannot land green and broken.
- [x] The gate refuses to call an empty discovery a pass.
- [x] **Four scanners that broke when the gate created `node_modules/`** are
      fixed and share one statement of the rule (`scripts/git-corpus.ts`).
      Recorded against `xd1g`, which is where that survey lives.
## Corrected 2026-09-26 — this bean was closed with open boxes

It was marked `completed` while still carrying two unchecked items, which the
store's rule forbids. Both are now `folio-assistant-1s5s`:

- the package's **Python half runs nowhere** — CI's pytest step globs
  `cat-harness/scripts/tests/*.test.py`, which does not reach it;
- whether a published package should be **version-checked** against the
  platform it ships beside (`typescript ^7` here against the root's `^6`,
  which is what made this bean's breakage possible).

**The JS half is done, and was the half this bean could reach.** `bun run test`
had never passed in the package's life — `vitest run` reporting *"No test files
found, exiting with code 1"*. `tests/parity.test.ts` now holds the Zod half to
every case the Pydantic suite pins, case by case and named for its counterpart,
because the package's promise is that the two agree rather than that either
works alone. `check:published-packages` runs `test` as well as `build`, and was
falsified by making a test fail.
