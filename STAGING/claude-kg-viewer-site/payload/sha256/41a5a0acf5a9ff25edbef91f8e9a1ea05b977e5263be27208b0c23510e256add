Owner, 2026-10-06 (https://claude.ai/code/session_012qoycyCSGidZqW245vXhze), verbatim:

> LHS top navbar used to have a QR code icon that would make a QR code for the currently viewed page and show it inside the LHS navbar.

## Measured
- The generator is still shipped. `cat-harness/docs/_includes/head_custom.html:181` documents *"Site UI: a QR of the current page in the sidebar header"*, and lines 644-645 load `assets/js/vendor/qrcode.js` and `qrcode_UTF8.js` on every page.
- Commit that dropped the icon: `2d7b7d3d83b0510c89c2b0eb4c9fb24f7d6c74ee` (*"Action tiles: one launcher over the header's six actions (bean 1le7)"*, 2026-09-19) swept out the previous header action icons into the launcher grid.

## Done when
- [x] the commit that dropped the icon is named (`2d7b7d3d83b0510c89c2b0eb4c9fb24f7d6c74ee`)
- [x] the QR icon is back in the LHS top row as a declared navbar capability (the `9rq1` one-mechanism rule), on platform pages AND folio sites
- [x] clicking it shows the current page's QR code inside the LHS navbar; a second click hides it (`l4zi`: the inverse is reachable)
- [x] a navbar-inventory or e2e check fails if the icon is missing again (`test/navbar-qr.test.ts`, `test/navbar-row.e2e.ts`, `scripts/tests/navbar.test.ts`)
- [x] screenshots at desktop and phone width, sent to the owner (`rendered-verification`)

## Closed 2026-10-09
- Dropping commit identified: `2d7b7d3d83b0510c89c2b0eb4c9fb24f7d6c74ee`.
- Landed on branch `claude/5rmf-navbar-qr-icon` in cat-harness worktree, commit `9b35b760`:
  - Restored `"qr"` in `NAVBAR_ICONS` (`schemas/cat-harness.ts`) and updated `NavbarIconsSchema` max to 8.
  - Declared `"qr"` in `cat-harness.json` and generated `docs/_data/harness.json`.
  - In `docs/assets/js/navbar-row.js`, added `QR_GLYPH`, `ROW_GLYPHS.qr`, `LABELS.qr = "QR code for this page"`, button creation with accessible attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-expanded`), and `.fa-qr-panel` with SVG renderer and dynamic vendor script loader fallback. Supported toggle on click, click on panel to dismiss, Escape key to dismiss, and hashchange re-render.
  - In `docs/assets/css/navbar-row.css`, added styles for `.fa-qr-panel` inside sidebar on desktop and fixed modal on mobile (<50rem).
  - Added unit test suite `test/navbar-qr.test.ts` (7 passing), updated `scripts/tests/navbar.test.ts` (106 passing), `schemas/navbar-icons.test.ts` (14 passing), `test/navbar-row.e2e.ts`, and confirmed `bun run typecheck` clean.
  - Rendered verification screenshots captured at desktop (1280x800) and phone (375x667):
    - `af3e9a4f-087e-48f3-aa3a-7c9476128a6b/qr-navbar-desktop.png`
    - `af3e9a4f-087e-48f3-aa3a-7c9476128a6b/qr-navbar-mobile.png`

## Reopened (2026-10-10, drain ml9h)

Lane B's e2e run (possible since cat-harness-tools#69) shows the navbar QR icon still not rendered. Cause: the icon is not declared in litlfred/cat-harness's cat-harness.json navbarIcons. Fix: add "qr" between fsh-guts and launcher, regenerate docs/_data/harness.json.

## Correction (lane A)

The fix already exists: litlfred/cat-harness 9b35b76 restores "qr" in navbarIcons. The index pins cat-harness a89998b, which predates it, so it is not rendered here yet. It arrives with the next cat-harness re-pin, which needs ndp0 first (the moved scripts). Close when that re-pin lands and the e2e shows the icon.

## Progress 2026-10-12 (lane C)
cat-harness#171 and cat-harness-tools#156 are merged. The QR panel pins the bar open, so it no longer opens as a 56px sliver, and the phone card clears the top bar. The e2e check's screenshots are in `test/results/5rmf`. Still open: naming the commit that dropped the QR icon, which needs history a shallow clone of the monorepo doesn't reach.
- The dropping commit was already named on 2026-10-09: `2d7b7d3d83b0510c89c2b0eb4c9fb24f7d6c74ee`. Every done-when box is met, so the bean is completed.

_2026-10-16T07:00:00Z_ — Store reconciliation (owner ruling 2026-10-16, item 9): the `ndp0` block is lifted here. The bean was completed on 2026-10-12 with every done-when ticked, and the other two copies had already dropped the edge. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01K9Xi9QSxCNYju8QNu7EuHg.

## From the cat-harness-tools store copy (reverse reconciliation, 2026-10-22)

_These sections existed only in the cat-harness-tools copy and are carried here under owner ruling 2026-10-16 item 9, which keeps notes that only one copy has. They are historical and do not change this bean's status. The forward direction is litlfred/cat-harness-tools#558. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BiusQ9uAZiHP6TUhfwZ2h6._

### Re-triage 2026-10-10 (lane B drain)

- [x] The icon is back as a declared navbar capability. `cat-harness/docs/assets/js/navbar-row.js` (`.fa-nav-qr` → `.fa-qr-panel`) has it, and `test/navbar-qr.test.ts` passes 7/7 in the CI-shaped mount. The test checks the button, its accessible attributes, the open → hide toggle (l4zi), Escape, and the hashchange update.
- [ ] The e2e check (`test/navbar-row.e2e.ts`, "QR icon button toggles…") exists, but **the e2e suite cannot start** (cat-tools-g9m3), so it has never fired, and the screenshots for rendered verification can't come from it yet. Now blocked by g9m3.
- [ ] Not done: the commit that dropped the icon is still unnamed. The history before the move lives in the folio-assistant monorepo.


### Finding 2026-10-10: the icon is not declared, so it is not drawn

With e2e running (PR #69 for g9m3), `navbar-row.e2e.ts` fails exactly the 5rmf checks. The rendered row is `Todos, Beans, fsh-guts…, More actions`, with no `QR code for this page`. `navbar-row.js` can draw `qr`, and `NAVBAR_ICONS` in `cat-harness/schemas/cat-harness.ts` allows it, but `cat-harness/cat-harness.json`'s `navbarIcons` does not list it, so `docs/_data/harness.json` resolves `[close, todos, beans, fsh-guts, launcher]`. **The fix is in litlfred/cat-harness:** add `"qr"` between `"fsh-guts"` and `"launcher"` in `navbarIcons` and regenerate `docs/_data/harness.json` (`bun run cat docs:harness`). After that, the two e2e checks here should pass unchanged.

### Lane C, 2026-10-12: the icon is drawn, and its panel now works

- [x] **Declared and drawn.** `qr` is in `cat-harness.json` `navbarIcons` on cat-harness main. The e2e check `navbar-row.e2e.ts` "QR icon button toggles…" passes locally with a minimal Playwright config, which skips the global setup that g9m3 blocks.
- [x] **The rendered check found two defects**, both fixed in cat-harness `fix/qr-opens-rail`:
  - Desktop: the code opened as a 56px sliver inside the collapsed strip. The pointer on the icon column holds the strip shut (`.fa-nav-tip-hold`). Opening the code now pins the bar, and closing it unpins only a pin it made.
  - Phone (390px): the card's top rows sat under the fixed top bar. It now starts at 3rem.
- [x] **The e2e check now fails if the code opens in a closed bar**, or if closing it leaves the bar pinned or held open. It fails on cat-harness main and passes with the fix. `navbar-row`, `sidebar-rail`, `rail-tips`, `rail-icon-row` and `site-title-rtl` pass 100/100.
- [x] **Screenshots** (desktop 1280px, phone 390px) are in `test/results/5rmf/`, taken from the e2e fixture with the fix applied.
- [ ] **Still open:** the commit that dropped the icon is still not named. The pre-split history is in the folio-assistant monorepo, and this session's clone is shallow. This is archaeology only; nothing that ships depends on it.

_2026-10-16T06:30:00Z_ — Store reconciliation: status `todo` → `completed` (Owner ruling 2026-10-16, item 9: "based on semantic content"; the copies said folio-assistant: completed, cat-harness: completed, cat-harness-tools: todo). Evidence: every done-when ticked 2026-10-14 with evidence: QR button in navbar-row.js, test/navbar-qr.test.ts in cat-harness-tools (since d8d42ab); cat-harness#171 and cat-harness-tools#156 merged. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01Pc8vSeXCwp5Ckvmz56cMDs.
