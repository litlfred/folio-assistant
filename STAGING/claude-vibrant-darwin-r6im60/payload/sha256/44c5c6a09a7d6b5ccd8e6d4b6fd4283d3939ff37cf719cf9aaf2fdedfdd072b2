A **preventive** record, not a defect: this bean exists so the next agent that
meets this refusal twice does not "fix" it by widening a glob — which is the
mistake `merge-conflict-patterns` names in its own opening and which I came within
one step of making.

## Where it came from

Swept the merge-main bot's refusals across all 13 open `merge-main` PRs on
2026-10-03, while #2029 added the one real gap (`prov-qaqc`). Five PRs refused, on
six distinct paths. `cat-harness/scripts/artefact-verification.json` is the **only
one that recurs** — #1958 and #1955 — so it is the one that looks like an omission.

## Why it is not

It reads like a generated sidecar: under `scripts/`, a `.json`, keys derived from
`package.json`. Two facts, read rather than inferred, rule out a `take-base`:

- `cat-harness/scripts/task-io.ts:109` classifies `check:artefact-verification` as
  `READ_ONLY`. **No script writes this file.** A pattern's `regen` step runs the
  stale check's writer; there is none, so `take-base` here is a silent *discard*,
  not a resolution.
- Its own `_comment` requires every `none` entry to carry **a reason, in prose**,
  and states the file *"may only SHRINK as entries move from `none` to `verified`"*.
  A branch that adds a gated check adds an authored sentence. Taking base drops
  exactly that sentence.

So a two-branch conflict here is a genuine editorial merge: both reasons are wanted,
and which survives is a judgement. **Human merge is the correct cost of the file's
shape**, not a hole in the catalogue.

## The one thing that would change this

If a writer is ever added — a `--write` that composes the derived key set and
carries forward existing reasons — then the file becomes regenerable and a
`take-base` + `regen` pattern becomes correct. That is the falsifier, and it is a
change to `check-artefact-verification.ts`, not to the catalogue.

## Done when

- [ ] the reasoning above is reachable from the catalogue itself, so a sweep finds
  it without re-deriving: a comment in `merge-conflict-patterns.ts` naming this
  path as deliberately unlisted, with the two facts and this bean id
- [ ] (not this bean) if a writer is added, the pattern is added with it

The second item is deliberately left open rather than scheduled: nothing today
wants a writer, and inventing one to make merges cheaper would be adding a
mechanism to serve the merge tool rather than the gate.
