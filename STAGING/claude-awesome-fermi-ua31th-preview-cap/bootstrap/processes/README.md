# processes

bootstrap's [Processes](../schemas/README.md#process): `initialize-harness.bpmn`, the only one an [Actor](../schemas/README.md#actor) starts; `discussion.bpmn`, which it calls to determine the harness and repositories; `human-agent-discussion.bpmn`, the reusable discussion every diagram calls to ask a person anything; `complete-initialization.bpmn`, which checks every initialization step the declarations name; and `log-message.bpmn`, which any step may call to record what it is doing. `ns.jsonld` defines the elements these diagrams add to BPMN (skill, role, precondition), written with the prefix `bootstrap.processes:`.

Part of [Bootstrap](../README.md) 0.1.0, declared as `processes`, holding `processes`.
