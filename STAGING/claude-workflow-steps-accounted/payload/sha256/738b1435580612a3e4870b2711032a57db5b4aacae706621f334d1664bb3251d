Recorded from the qou work-plan analysis, 2026-10-04 (session https://claude.ai/code/session_01NdDGeP1SyShmoUssLuRZ91). Not started: recorded so the gap has an owner. The owner ruled 2026-10-04 for qou: use the cat-harness qa-reports branch. The folio_init template (cat-harness/templates/) still writes a layout that commits sidecars on main. Reconcile the template with skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/qa-reports.md.

## Closed 2026-10-09

Reconciled `folio_init` templates and generated guidance with `skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/qa-reports.md` (derived QA verdicts stored on orphan `qa-reports` branch, authored judgements on `main` in `test/attestations/`, working copy in `test/results/` machine-written and not committed to `main`).

- **Worktree branch**: `claude/5qy8-qa-sidecar-location`
- **Commit**: `97272f89a45ecfa39f93ea2cc2622cbf19ad3278`
- **Changes**:
  - `templates/document/github/workflows/qa-sweep.yml`:
    - Updated docblock and comments to clarify that QA sidecars produced in working copy under `test/results/` during sweep are checked for schema sanity for the `qa-reports` branch and not committed to `main`.
  - `scripts/init-folio.ts`:
    - Updated generated README/AGENTS layout: `test/results/block-qa/` documented as machine-written working copy published to `qa-reports`, and added `test/attestations/` for reviewer judgements and baseline attestations committed on `main`.
    - Removed outdated instruction "Commit those files with the edit they are about"; reconciled with `qa-reports.md` policy.
  - `scripts/tests/init-folio-qa.test.ts` & `scripts/tests/init-folio.test.ts`:
    - Verified against updated text and layout.
- **Verification Evidence**:
  - `bun test scripts/tests/init-folio-qa.test.ts`: 2 pass, 0 fail (2.45s).
  - `bun test scripts/tests/init-folio.test.ts`: 44 pass, 0 fail (5.00s).
  - Combined suite: 46 pass, 0 fail (7.00s).
  - `bun run typecheck`: 0 errors (clean).

## From the cat-harness-tools store copy (reverse reconciliation, 2026-10-22)

_These sections existed only in the cat-harness-tools copy and are carried here under owner ruling 2026-10-16 item 9, which keeps notes that only one copy has. They are historical and do not change this bean's status. The forward direction is litlfred/cat-harness-tools#558. Session https://claude.ai/code/session_01BiusQ9uAZiHP6TUhfwZ2h6._

### Progress 2026-10-10 (lane B drain, PR for cat-tools-yylt)

- [x] The scaffold's `.gitignore` now ignores `test/results/`, the QA working copy. Derived verdicts go to `qa-reports`; `test/attestations/` stays committed. Tested in `init-folio.test.ts`.
- [x] `qa-sweep.yml` and `qa-sweep-nightly.yml` already publish to `qa-reports` and commit nothing.
- [ ] **One contradiction is left, in `templates/document/github/workflows/section-title-audit.yml`.** Its comments say verdicts live on `qa-reports`, but its hard gate regenerates `{{folio}}/<document>/section-title-audit.qa.json` and runs `git diff --exit-code` on it, so the sidecar must be committed and fresh on main. The sidecar also carries the **agent** story-coherence verdicts (`agent[key]`, carried forward by `reviewed_hash`), and those are judgements, not derived results.

### Owner decision

Where do section-title-audit's agent verdicts live?

1. **(Recommended)** Move the `agent` slots to `test/attestations/section-title/…` (judgements on main, as ruling D2 says), make the sidecar a derived working copy published to `qa-reports`, and replace the freshness gate with compute-and-judge.
2. Keep the sidecar committed on main, and record it in `skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/qa-reports.md` as a named exception: a file that carries judgements.
3. Drop the agent block from the sidecar entirely and keep only the machine review.
4. Leave it as it is.

**Default if no answer:** option 2. It is documentation only: no data moves and no gate changes.

### Owner ruling 2026-10-11 (relayed by lane A, answered in their session)

**Option 1:** move section-title-audit's agent slots to `test/attestations/section-title/…`, make the sidecar a derived working copy published to `qa-reports`, and replace its freshness gate with compute-and-judge.

### Progress 2026-10-11 (lane B), owner option 1
- [x] cat-harness#142 (merged): the `section-title` family in qa-attestations/v1.
- [x] cat-harness-tools#119: verdicts go to `<attestations>/section-title/<paper>/section-title-audit.attestations.json`. The derived copy goes to `test/results/section-title/<paper>/section-title-audit.json`. A legacy sidecar's verdicts are auto-moved. The template gate is now compute-and-judge.

### Summary of Changes

Built to the owner's option 1.
- **cat-harness#142** adds the `section-title` family to qa-attestations/v1. It holds decided verdicts only, each pinned to the hash it reviewed.
- **cat-harness-tools#119** splits section-title-audit by provenance:
  - verdicts go to `<attestations>/section-title/<paper>/section-title-audit.attestations.json`, written by `--verdict`;
  - the derived copy goes to `test/results/section-title/<paper>/section-title-audit.json`. It is not `*.qa.json`, because the template's schema-sanity step requires block-qa/v1 of those.
- A legacy committed sidecar's decided verdicts move into the store on first save. Removing the legacy file from main is left to a person.
- The template's git-diff freshness gate is now compute-and-judge: it computes the derived copy, and an unreadable store exits 2.
