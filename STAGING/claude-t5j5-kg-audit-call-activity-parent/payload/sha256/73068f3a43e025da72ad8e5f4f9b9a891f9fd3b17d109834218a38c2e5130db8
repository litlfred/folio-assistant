## The defect

`content/pipeline/qa-sweep.ts` short-circuits a criterion with
`automated: false` straight to `needs-agent` **before** either scoping gate
runs. So neither `adapters` nor the new `profiles` axis can scope an
agent-adjudicated criterion — the gates are unreachable for exactly the
criteria whose adjudication is most expensive.

Found while building the profile axis (bean `g6yr`, merged in #253). It is
**pre-existing**: the adapter gate has had the same hole since it was added,
and the profile gate inherited the ordering rather than introducing it.

## Why it matters more than an ordering nit

An agent-adjudicated criterion that should have been `n/a` becomes a queued
agent request instead. That is not a wrong verdict, it is a wrong *bill* —
and it lands on the drain queue where somebody pays for the model call before
anyone notices the criterion never applied.

Measured consequence at the time of finding: **10 `script-quality` criteria**
(`does_not_default_to_float`, `respects_archimedean_wall`, …) are queued
against prose blocks with no `applies_to` restricting them.

## The fix, and the reason it is not obvious

Move the `needs-agent` short-circuit to **after** both gates. The reason it
was not done under `g6yr` is that the ordering may be load-bearing for a
reason not visible from the sweep alone: a criterion could be `automated:
false` *and* deliberately unscoped, relying on the agent to decide
applicability. Check the drain-queue consumers before reordering — if any
treats `needs-agent` as "the agent decides scope", moving the gate changes
its contract.

## Verification gate

Re-run the sweep before and after over a document-profile folio and confirm
the `needs-agent` count drops by exactly the criteria the two gates exclude,
with no change to any `pass`/`fail`. A change in a binary verdict means the
reorder moved more than the queue.

## Not established

Whether any drain-queue consumer depends on the current ordering. Nobody has
looked.
