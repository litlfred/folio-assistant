Child (e) of the merge-gate epic. These are merge-steward gaps measured 2026-10-02 while running merge trains. Each one lets a merge look proved when it is not.

1. `regen-after-merge.ts` has no writer pair for `check:l1-complete`, nor for `smart-base:smart-kg-l1` (the `--entry` form). Both run in `code-quality-gates.yml`, so a train's single `regen` can report "current" while CI then goes red.
2. `merge-base.ts` resolves a submodule gitlink conflict to main's side even when the branch's pin is a fast-forward of main's. The pin bump is silently reverted.
3. GitHub does not trigger `pull_request` CI while a PR has conflicts, so a PR can enter a merge train with no CI on its head. `pr-checks-present` (`3pqn`) finds this hourly, but the train does not ask.
4. `merge-main.yml` adds `needs-merge-human` on refusal and never removes it after a later successful merge, so the label goes stale.

## Done when
- [ ] (1) regen has a writer for each of the two checks, or a declared reason why it cannot; regen-vs-CI parity is tested
- [ ] (2) a gitlink conflict takes the descendant pin when one side fast-forwards the other, and refuses when the pins diverge; tested both ways
- [ ] (3) the merge train refuses a PR whose head has no completed CI run (reusing `check:head-has-run`)
- [ ] (4) a successful merge:main run removes `needs-merge-human`
