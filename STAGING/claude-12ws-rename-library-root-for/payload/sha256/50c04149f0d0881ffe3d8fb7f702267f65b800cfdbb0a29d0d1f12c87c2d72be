Reported 2026-10-06 by session A (session_01FrpbCpM7BWxGCPsu618MLr). On #2273, and on #2192 earlier, `slice-sqlite.e2e.ts` failed with ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED: the Playwright webServer (`node test-server.mjs`) died partway through the shard. One re-run passed each time.

'Flake' is not a root cause. A server that dies under one spec is a defect either in that spec (a payload or slice size that crashes the server, a resource limit) or in the server.

## Done when
- [ ] The server's exit is captured: its stderr and exit code are attached to the Playwright report when a shard sees connection refused.
- [ ] The cause is named: which request kills it, and why.
- [ ] It is fixed at that layer, and a test reproduces the crash before the fix.
