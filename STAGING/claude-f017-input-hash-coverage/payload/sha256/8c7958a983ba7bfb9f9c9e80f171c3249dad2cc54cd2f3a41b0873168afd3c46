Owner goal 2026-10-05 "CI build speedup" (session_01VfkKocGaQW7Msro2t5S66U): make code-quality-gates.yml wall time as short as possible without dropping or weakening any gate. Follows `dlqu` (SPEED-UP 4).

## Measured before
main run 37253911158 (98ab8cd, green): ~9m20s wall. Critical path = `Repository gates (hard)` 8m33s, of which `check:cat-harness-standalone` alone is 4m09s (added by #1977). Next longest: bun test shard 1 3m36s.

## Plan
1. `check:cat-harness-standalone` into its own parallel job.
2. Remaining gates steps into two balanced parallel jobs; `Repository gates (hard)` kept as the check NAME on a roll-up that is green only if all three succeeded (same shape as `typescript` / `e2e`).
3. qa-publish waits only for the two corpus parts, so it runs beside the standalone ratchet.
4. Cache Playwright Chromium in e2e shards.

## Done when
PR CI is green apart from main's known reds, every step that ran before still runs (step-name diff), and the PR carries a before/after job timing table.


Issue: #2153


## Measured after (PR #2154, run 37269610652, attempt 1)
Wall 4m52s (05:51:13 to 05:56:05) against 9m24s on main run 37253911158. Parts: gates-standalone 234s, gates-docs 176s, gates-kg 160s, roll-up 3s, qa-publish 39s (starts after gates-docs instead of after all 85 steps). Reds: the standalone ratchet, the same 17 new failures main's tip run 37268420795 shows (tools/voices/viewer tests, not this change). On main those also SKIP the 22 steps after it; here those steps run in gates-docs and pass. Shard 4/4 had one 5.46 s timeout in check-tools and passed on rerun (attempt 2).
