  While idle or waiting on a long-running async task (a build, a long compute
  script, a CI run, a background agent), pull the applicable backlog in priority
  order and work non-conflicting items instead of stalling. Generalises AGENTS.md's
  5-minute idle trigger into a reusable skill. Use whenever blocked on an async
  wait with no substantive output to produce.

# idle-backlog

Generalises the AGENTS.md §"5-minute idle trigger" / "Work the queue while idle"
policy: an agent waiting on an async result should **not** sleep or poll — it
should pull the next applicable backlog item and advance it.

## When to fire

- A long-running task is in flight (a build, a > 5 min compute script,
  a CI run, a background `Agent`/`Bash`), **and**
- you would otherwise produce no substantive output (only TICKs / status polls /
  "still waiting").

## What to do — priority order

Walk the queue top-down; take the first item that is **applicable** (see below):

1. **Right-scoped Beans** — run `beans list` to find pending beans (issues) whose scope overlaps with your current work or branch. The `beans` CLI natively supports hierarchies (epics, milestones, parents, dependencies).
2. **QA backlog for the project's audit axes** — if no beans are found, systematically work through the QA backlog for the project's defined audit axes. You must:
   - Run a stale refresh
   - Populate unpopulated items
   - Resolve existing issues
3. **Current PR todos** — the open PR's body checklist + unresolved review-comment
   threads (`mcp__github__pull_request_read get_review_comments`).

## "Applicable" = non-conflicting with the in-flight task

- Content/doc work (`.md`/`.ts`/docs) is applicable while a **build** runs
  (different files; the build is unaffected).
- A **different-domain** tranche can be started on a **fresh branch via
  `git worktree`** — never `git checkout` on the build's checkout mid-build (it
  disrupts the running compile). The worktree shares `.git` but has its own
  working dir, so the in-flight build is untouched.
- Do **not** start work that edits the files the in-flight task is consuming, or
  that needs the in-flight result to verify (e.g. authoring new source to be
  built — wait for the baseline build first, per the build discipline).

## Always

- **Narrate** in chat as tasks are taken up and completed (owner directive).
- Microcommit + push each completed item.
- When the async task finishes, return to it (report green/red), then resume the
  backlog.

## Stop

Stop pulling backlog when the in-flight task completes (handle its result first)
or the owner redirects.
