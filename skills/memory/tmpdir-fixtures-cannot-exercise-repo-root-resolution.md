A check that has stopped working still passes such a test, because the test
never reaches the path that broke. Measured 2026-09-19: every pre-existing
`no-orphan-sidecar` fixture was `mkdtemp`, so none noticed that check becoming a
no-op returning a clean bill of health.

Build a miniature folio and `process.chdir` into it, restoring in `finally`.
Stubbing the root is worse than nothing — the test then agrees with the code by
construction.
