`<block>.qa.json` (block-qa/v1) carries per-criterion reviewer entries;
`<criterion-id>.script.json` is qa-script/v1. Producing types are
`schemas/block-qa.ts`. `qa-staleness.ts` reports; `qa-sweep.ts` repairs.

<!-- detail -->

A sidecar is **stale** when the recorded source hashes or a reviewer
`script_hash` drift from the current file contents. Refresh by deleting the
stale `criteria.<crit>` entry and re-running
`bun run content/pipeline/qa-sweep.ts <path> --only <crit>`.

**A standalone library `.lean` file has no sidecar** and escapes every
per-block checker. Nothing but an agent checks it.
