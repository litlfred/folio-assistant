`bun run check:ci-health` reports each workflow's state on the **default
branch**: consecutive failures, days since the last green, whether it has run
recently at all. The session-start sweep prints it, so it lands where you
already look.

1. **"Could not check" is never rendered as green.**
2. A red that has not re-run in a week is flagged **possibly stale**, not an
   active fire.
3. A red whose **workflow file changed after the failing run** is reported
   `superseded` — a later edit is evidence the failing version is gone, not
   evidence the new one works. Never green, never a live failure.
