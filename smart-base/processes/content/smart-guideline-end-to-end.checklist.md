# Checklist — SMART Guideline end to end

> **Generated, and not the authority.** This is `smart-base/processes/content/smart-guideline-end-to-end.bpmn` (process `Process_SgEndToEnd`) walked as a state machine. The diagram and the workflow engine decide; this list only reads them. Follow the `next:` line of each step rather than the order on the page, and record each step with the call it names, so the engine's committed state — not this list — says which edge was taken.

From a use case to a consuming application: identify the L1 guidelines, ingest them into an L1 knowledge graph, choose the L2 DAKs to build on, create or adapt the L2 assets, choose the L3 IGs to build on, produce the L3 assets, then build the L4 consuming application the requester describes.

## Begin — Use case to support (`StartEvent_Need`)

- Begin here: Someone needs a SMART Guideline, new or adapted, for a use case.
- Call `workflow_start` with `process: "Process_SgEndToEnd"` and the subject this run is about; keep the instance id it returns.
- next: → `Task_DescribeUseCase` (0 · Describe the use case)

### 1. 0 · Describe the use case (`Task_DescribeUseCase`)

- Who: the `Requester (country team / implementer)` lane (role `user`).
- Skill: `guideline-use-case`.
- What: Population, setting, jurisdiction, interventions in scope.
- Record it: `workflow_complete` with `node: "Task_DescribeUseCase"`.
- next: → `Task_IdentifyL1` (1 · Identify L1 guidelines and recommendations)

### 2. 1 · Identify L1 guidelines and recommendations (`Task_IdentifyL1`)

- Who: the `Authoring agent` lane (role `authoring-agent`).
- Skill: `dak-l1-library`.
- What: Component 1 sources of any DAK already in scope first, then WHO IRIS and the jurisdiction's own guidelines.
- Record it: `workflow_complete` with `node: "Task_IdentifyL1"`.
- next: → `Fork_L1`

### Do all of — `Fork_L1`

- Work every branch; none is optional. Branches: → `Task_AdjL1` (Adjudicate the L1 source list), → `Gateway_InKg` (All sources in an L1 KG?)
- The engine passes through this gateway itself; there is nothing to record here.

### 3. Adjudicate the L1 source list (`Task_AdjL1`)

- Who: the `Human adjudicators` lane (role `reviewer`).
- Skill: `content-review`.
- What: Clinical SME: each source with why it was included or left out.
- A subprocess (`Process_Review`): `workflow_next` reports its own steps; complete those — this call activity itself is not completable.
- next: → `End_AdjL1` (Adjudicated)

### Decide — All sources in an L1 KG? (`Gateway_InKg`)

- Call `workflow_complete` with `node: "Gateway_InKg"` and `outcome` set to the label that holds:
  - «no» → `Task_IngestKg` (2 · Ingest into the L1 KG)
  - «yes» → `Gateway_KgMerge`

## Done — Adjudicated (`End_AdjL1`)

- The instance completes here. `workflow_next` then reports nothing enabled — that, not this line, is the record of completion.

### 4. 2 · Ingest into the L1 KG (`Task_IngestKg`)

- Who: the `Authoring agent` lane (role `authoring-agent`).
- Skill: `recommendation-extraction`, `dak-l1-library`.
- What: Per source not yet extracted: cat ingest into library/, the generic-document layer (l1-library), then the L1 layer (recommendations, remarks, practices, scenario candidates) into library/<bib>/l1-extraction/.
- Record it: `workflow_complete` with `node: "Task_IngestKg"`.
- next: → `Fork_Kg`

### Merge — `Gateway_KgMerge`

- Nothing to do or decide: the paths meet here and the engine passes through.
- next: → `Task_DepsL2` (3 · Choose L2 dependencies (WHO / jurisdiction DAKs))

### Do all of — `Fork_Kg`

- Work every branch; none is optional. Branches: → `Task_AdjKg` (Adjudicate the L1 KG), → `Gateway_KgMerge`
- The engine passes through this gateway itself; there is nothing to record here.

- Who: the `Authoring agent` lane (role `authoring-agent`).
- Skill: `l2-dependency-choice`, `smart-base-tools`, `decision-comparison`.
- What: From the L1 KG: which existing DAKs to reuse, adapt, extend or reject, each with evidence and reason.
- Record it: `workflow_complete` with `node: "Task_DepsL2"`.
- next: → `Fork_DepsL2`

### 6. Adjudicate the L1 KG (`Task_AdjKg`)

- Who: the `Human adjudicators` lane (role `reviewer`).
- Skill: `content-review`, `recommendation-extraction`.
- What: l1-extraction-reviewer signs exclusions and coverage; Clinical SME reviews recommendations beside the printed page.
- A subprocess (`Process_Review`): `workflow_next` reports its own steps; complete those — this call activity itself is not completable.
- next: → `End_AdjKg` (Adjudicated)

### Do all of — `Fork_DepsL2`

- Work every branch; none is optional. Branches: → `Task_AdjDepsL2` (Adjudicate L2 dependencies), → `Task_L2` (4 · Create / adapt L2 DAK assets)
- The engine passes through this gateway itself; there is nothing to record here.

## Done — Adjudicated (`End_AdjKg`)

- The instance completes here. `workflow_next` then reports nothing enabled — that, not this line, is the record of completion.

### 7. Adjudicate L2 dependencies (`Task_AdjDepsL2`)

- Skill: `content-review`, `decision-audit`.

- Record it: `workflow_complete` with `node: "Task_L2"`.
- next: → `Fork_L2`

## Done — Adjudicated (`End_AdjDepsL2`)

- The instance completes here. `workflow_next` then reports nothing enabled — that, not this line, is the record of completion.

### Do all of — `Fork_L2`

- Work every branch; none is optional. Branches: → `Task_AdjL2` (Review each L2 asset (before / after if adapted)), → `Task_DepsL3` (5 · Choose L3 dependencies (WHO / jurisdiction IGs))

- Record it: `workflow_complete` with `node: "Task_DepsL3"`.
- next: → `Fork_DepsL3`

## Done — Adjudicated (`End_AdjDepsL3`)

- The instance completes here. `workflow_next` then reports nothing enabled — that, not this line, is the record of completion.

### Decide — L1 extraction and L2 assets exist, review requested? (`Gateway_L3Ready`)

- Decided on Task_L3Ready's ready: yes only when every L3 asset about to be written has an L2 asset upstream, every L2 asset an L1 node, and each review has been requested (opened and staged, verdict not awaited).
- Call `workflow_complete` with `node: "Gateway_L3Ready"` and `outcome` set to the label that holds:

- A subprocess (`Process_Review`): `workflow_next` reports its own steps; complete those — this call activity itself is not completable.
