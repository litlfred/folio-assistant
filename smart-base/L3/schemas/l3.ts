/**
 * Knowledge-graph layer L3, version 3.0, as typed data.
 *
 * MIGRATED from WorldHealthOrganization/smart-kg `ontology/l3/l3.json` at
 * commit 3f5e477b9628fa818e71a2b2298371196c5af97c (main), the commit L1 was migrated from.
 * Every note, predicate, edge, grounding and omission is carried verbatim. What is
 * NEW is each property's type, Zod schema and FHIR mapping, and the value sets
 * that bind properties smart-kg named in prose (each says so in its note).
 *
 * smart-kg is deprecated (owner, 2026-10-16): this file is the source of truth.
 * `npm run build` in smart-base/L1/schemas/ regenerates `generated/` and the FSH.

  note: "The FHIR layer, as a THIN TYPED INDEX and nothing more. Each class carries a canonical URL, a resource type, the profile the artefact actually declares, and status metadata -- no action trees, no element definitions, no bindings, no CQL. That is docs/SCOPE.md's corollary applied: FHIR has canonical references, a validator and a publisher, so it is indexed by URL and never re-represented. What this layer adds that FHIR cannot answer is which L2 component an artefact implements, and therefore which L1 recommendation it ultimately rests on.",
  profileNote: "NO CLASS ASSERTS A PROFILE. WHO's own sources disagree: smart-base defines 15 SG* profiles (SGPlanDefinition, SGDecisionTable, SGLogicalModel and so on), while the published SOP in smart-ig-starter-kit/input/pagecontent never mentions them and directs authors to CRMI, CPG, CQFM and SDC profiles instead. The immunizations IG settles it in practice -- all 138 of its PlanDefinitions declare cpg-recommendationdefinition and all 41 Measures declare proportion-measure-cqfm; not one SG* profile is used. Rather than hard-code either answer, `profile` is a property read off the artefact, and the disagreement is recorded here for the technical working group.",
