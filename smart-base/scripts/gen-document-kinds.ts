 * components, one section each, built from `DAK_COMPONENTS` (the list) and
 * `DAK_CARDS` (each component's title and description). Both already state the
 * components; restating them by hand in a JSON file would give the repository a
 * third copy free to drift. `--check` regenerates in memory and fails on a
 * difference, which is what makes a hand edit visibly a defect.

 * `dak.coverage.<ig>.json` — the DAK view of each ingested IG's artefact
 * index, written into the `document-kinds` directory that IG's OWN instance
 * declares ({@link coverageDirFor}); only this layer's own coverage is
 * written here.
 *
 * `l1.json` and `dth.json` are authored, not generated: their sections are
 * read from publications (owner, 2026-10-01: the SMART Guidelines paper, the
 * WHO guideline-development handbook and the DTHs), not from code.
