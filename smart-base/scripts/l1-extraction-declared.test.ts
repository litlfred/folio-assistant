/**
 * Every `l1-extractions/<entry>/` is DECLARED, with the `l1-extraction`
 * typology — and every such declaration names a directory that is there.
 *
 * Until 2026-10-30 the output sat inside its library entry, at
 * `library/<entry>/l1-extraction/`. The handbook's sections then moved to
 * who-iris (who-iris#107), and a library folder holding only the extraction
 * read as a second copy of the entry, so folio-assistant's library ingest
 * refused the duplicate slug. The extraction is smart-base's own (owner,
 * 2026-10-16), so it moved to `l1-extractions/<entry>/` here.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-12, bean 8pzh item 1: the extraction output stays beside its
 * library entry AND is published with the source — "if its a part of the KG it
 * should be published". It was not published because it was not part of the
 * declared KG: plain files under `library/`, which no typology named. The
 * library publisher (`cat-harness-tools/scripts/gen-library-viz.ts`) publishes
 * the directories declared inside an entry whose kind is `within: "library"`,
 * so an undeclared `l1-extraction/` is an unpublished one, silently. This test
 * is what makes the declaration checked rather than assumed.
 *
 * Read from the files alone — the declaration and the typology node — so it
 * runs in this repository without the harness mounted.
