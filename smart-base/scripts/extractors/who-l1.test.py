Exercise the WHO L1 extractor, `who-l1.py` beside this file.

It moved here from cat-harness-tools (`scripts/tests/who-l1-extractor.test.py`)
with the extractor (bean saqd, row 6). It runs the extractor two ways:

  - **directly**, by loading `who-l1.py` and calling `extract` on the
    fixture's sections. Always runs: no other layer is needed.
  - **through the shared CLI**, cat-harness-tools'
    `scripts/extract-candidates.py`, with this layer as the only extractor
    root, when that layer is mounted (`<repo>/cat-harness-tools`, a sibling
    clone, or `$CAT_HARNESS_TOOLS_ROOT`). This is what pins
    `document_class` and the `"validated": false` flag in `candidates.json`.
    When it is not mounted that half says SKIP, never ok.

## What this does and does not establish

It builds a **synthetic** L1 fixture from the structure documented in
`local/document-intake` §"WHO-Specific Processing" and asserts the
extractor finds each normative element and maps it to the right block
kind. That is a logic test.

It is **not** validation against a real WHO guideline. No L1 PDF exists
in the corpus and `who.int` / `iris.who.int` are 403-blocked by the egress
policy (measured 2026-08-15), so the real-layout question — do
recommendations survive Stage A's text extraction as recognisable lines
once they have been through a *ruled box*, does a GRADE table survive as
anything parseable — is untouched by this file and remains open.

Read a pass here as "the regexes do what they claim on well-formed
input", not "the L1 path works". `candidates.json` reports
`"validated": false` for this class for exactly that reason, and should
keep doing so until a real guideline has been run.

RECOMMENDATION 1: Daily oral iron and folic acid supplementation is
recommended for pregnant women to prevent maternal anaemia.

(Strong recommendation, moderate certainty of the evidence)

GRADE: ⊕⊕⊕◯ moderate

Remarks: Implementation should account for local anaemia prevalence and
existing supplementation programmes.

Good practice statement: Counselling on side-effects should accompany
every supplementation contact.

Research priority: The optimal dosing interval in settings with high
malaria burden has not been established.

RECOMMENDATION 2: Ultrasound scan before 24 weeks of gestation is
recommended for pregnant women to estimate gestational age.
