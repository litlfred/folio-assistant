/**
 * dak-data-dictionary-diff.ts: what changed between two DAK data-dictionary
 * annexes, term by term. It is the diff a glossary or core-data-element
 * reviewer reads.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-14: every L2 component's agent-edit, human-review
 * subprocess documents its skills and tools, and builds a missing tool when
 * it is small. `l2-component-edit-review.bpmn` renders a glossary change for
 * its reviewer as a TERM diff: which data elements were added, removed or
 * changed, and in which cells. A word diff of the annex JSON is unreadable,
 * because a reordered sheet moves every line. A picture of the rendered
 * table hides a one-cell edit in a 400-row workbook.
 *
 * ## Keyed by the data element id, never by position
 *
 * Both annexes are `dak-data-dictionary/v1` (`schemas/dak-annexes.ts`), so
 * each names its `idColumn`. A row is matched to its counterpart by that id.
 * Cells are matched by column KEY (`headerKey`), so a column that moved is
 * not a change, and a column added or dropped is reported once per sheet
 * rather than once per row. An id that moves to another sheet is reported as
 * moved, not as a removal plus an addition.
 *
 * ## What it does not judge
 *
 * Whether a change is right. That is the reviewer's call. Whether ids are
 * unique and references resolve is `check-web-annexes.ts`, the glossary
 * checker that runs beside this diff in the same subprocess. A duplicated id
 * in either input is refused here (exit 2), not diffed, because "which row
 * is IMMZ.C.DE.1" would have two answers.
 *
 *   bun run smart-base/scripts/dak-data-dictionary-diff.ts <before.json> <after.json> [--json]
 *
 * Exit: 0 no term changed · 1 terms changed (the diff is printed) · 2 an
 * input is unreadable or ambiguous.
