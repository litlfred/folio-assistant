/**
 * L1 bound to the library it is read from — an extension layer over L1 3.0.
 *
 * Owner rulings, 2026-10-07 (folio-assistant session on the immunizations L1
 * library), which this layer encodes:
 *
 * 1. **Layering: every layer points only upstream.** L3 → L2 → L1 → library.
 *    The library — the ingested source document, its sections and blocks — is
 *    upstream of L1, so L1 MAY point at it; L1 never points down at L2 or L3.
 *    This refines 3.0's "nothing in L1 points out of L1", which was written
 *    before the library was a layer: the downstream half of it stands.
 *
 * 2. **L1's layout classes specialise the library's.** A `publication` IS a
 *    library source document, a `publication-section` IS a library section,
 *    and a `publication-element` IS a library block, each with L1's extra
 *    properties. Whatever sectioning strategy the library adopts — pages, an
 *    outline, a consensus TOC — L1 inherits it rather than inventing its own.
 *    Two levels:
 *      - class: `rdfs:subClassOf` ({@link SPECIALISES}), emitted as JSON-LD;
 *      - instance: `specializationOf` (PROV, "shares all aspects of the latter,
 *        and additionally presents more specific aspects") from each L1 layout
 *        node to the library node it specialises. L1 keeps smart-kg's IRIs
 *        (3.0 `iriPattern`), the library keeps its own, and the edge is what
 *        makes them one thing in two vocabularies — without `owl:sameAs`,
 *        which would merge every statement about both.
 *
 * 3. **A source the library holds but that is not L1** (a DAK, a technical
 *    specification) is still a resolution target: a DAK's reference entry
 *    resolves upstream to its library node rather than staying unresolved.
 *
 * 4. **Implementation guidance is not a guideline** (owner ruling 1b,
 *    2026-10-12). A publication whose publicationType is
 *    `implementation-guidance` "makes no recommendations of its own" (handbook
 *    §1.9), so what it prints as practice is an `implementation-practice` node,
 *    not a `recommendation` of some new kind. It lives HERE rather than in
 *    `l1.ts` for the same reason as the rest of this file: `l1.ts` stays the
 *    migrated 3.0 layer, unextended. L1 3.0's `remark` cannot
 *    attach to it — its IRI is minted under a recommendation — so that waits
 *    on an upstream change.
 *
 * The extension lives here, beside the migrated 3.0 layer and not inside it, so
 * the 3.0 layer stays as migrated and this stays a layer of its own. (It was
 * to be proposed to smart-kg; smart-kg is deprecated, owner 2026-10-16.) A document that uses it names
 * `l1-library.context.jsonld`; smart-kg's `validate.mjs` cannot check such a
 * document until the layer is upstream, and `validate.ts` here can.
