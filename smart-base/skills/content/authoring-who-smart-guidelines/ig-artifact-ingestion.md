The artefact index of a FHIR Implementation Guide is a knowledge graph keyed
by the IG's own canonical URLs, linking each artefact to its JSON, JSON Schema
and JSON-LD representations. No IG publishes such an index itself, so it is
always **assembled**, and it records what each part was built from. This
skill says how an index is assembled in this harness; it does not judge
whether an IG's content is correct (that is `fhir-validation`'s job).

## Which IGs carry the IG API overlay

Every IG gets an index; the JSON Schema and JSON-LD links come only from an
**IG API** (WHO calls it the DAK API): the per-artefact sidecars and the
enumeration schemas (`ValueSets.schema.json`, `LogicalModels.schema.json`)
that [`dak-postprocessing`](dak-postprocessing.md) steps 3–6 produce. The
index's `sidecarApi` says which:

- `present` — sidecars were found and bound to artefacts;
- `absent` — the source was read and held none;
- `unknown` — nobody looked. **`unknown` is not a kind of `absent`**: only
  `absent` is a reason to stop.

An IG with no IG API is a thin index, not an error.

## Where the index is built: at publish, from the AST

An IG instance does not commit its `fhir-artifact-index/`. fhir-harness's
`ig-index:build` (`fhir-harness/scripts/build-ig-indexes.ts`) writes it at
publish:

| document | schema | built from |
|---|---|---|
| `index.json` | `folio-fhir-artifact-index/v2` | the IG's cached AST, by `ast-to-artifact-index.ts`; its manifest says `authority: "cache"` |
| `menu.json` | `folio-ig-menu/v1` | the IG's own `sushi-config.yaml` `menu:`, at the commit the checkout's lock pins (`buildMenu`) |
| `releases.json` | `ig-releases/v1` | the repository's GitHub releases, as pointers to their assets; a failed read writes no file, because no list is not an empty list |
| `package.tgz` | — | the AST's resources, as `package/<Type>-<id>.json`, with a `package/package.json` from `sushi-config.yaml` |
| `sidecars/` | — | the IG API sidecars a layer above writes (`ig-site:sidecars`), bound to the artefacts |
| `contexts/` | — | each `.jsonld` under `input/images/` whose only key is `@context` |

`ig-identity.json` (`folio-ig-identity/v1`: id, canonical, version,
**status**, read from `sushi-config.yaml`) sits beside them when present. An
IG with no identity file has no status this pipeline can state and draws no
watermark; that is not "published".

Each document has a **different source**, so each carries its own
provenance. Folding two together would give one file two answers to "where
did this come from".

### The menu is the IG's own ordering of itself

`sushi-config.yaml`'s `menu:` is a nested **map**, and order is the file's
order. Never sort it: that would re-navigate somebody else's IG. Read it from
the source config, never from a screenshot: a picture carries no hrefs, and a
closed dropdown looks like an empty one.

### The chrome comes from a chain, and only part of it is the IG's own

An IG declares its appearance in **no file it owns**: it comes from the
`fhir.template` chain its `ig.ini` names, for example

```
local-template  →  who.template.root 0.5.0  →  fhir.base.template 1.0.0
```

So the chrome (`folio-ig-chrome/v2`) is keyed by the chain's top template and
lives once, in smart-base's `themes/chrome.json`, worn by every IG on that
chain. It carries `layers` base-first, and every token records which package
**won** it and what it **overrode**, which is how to answer *whose value is
this?* For example `who.css` styles no `#publish-box`, so the yellow box is
HL7's: the token comes out `from: "fhir.base.template"` with `overrides: []`.

**An overlay is not a merge.** `--toc-box-border` is `1px solid navy` in HL7
and `navy` in WHO — each right in its own layer, but together they make HL7's
rule resolve to `border: navy`, which is invalid. Every layer parses on its
own, so a naive merge ships a broken rule silently.

### Upstream defects are recorded, never corrected

The chrome mirrors its sources, defects included, and records whose each
defect is:

- **`shape`** — one token name carrying different kinds of value across
  layers, as above.
- **`malformed`** — a value that is not valid CSS on its own terms, such as
  `--breadcrumb-text-color: ##555555` (a doubled `#` in HL7's
  `project.css`).

A carried defect shows up in generated pages looking exactly like an ingest
bug, which is why the record names its owner. The detector matches one
narrow pattern: a false positive would accuse someone else's stylesheet of a
fault it does not have.

`ingest:ig-chrome:check` compares the committed chrome with the template
chain. CI cannot fetch the template repositories, so with no source it exits
**2** (`could not determine`), never 0, and it is registered as a `report`,
not a gate. Run it by hand after cloning the IG and its templates.

## What the AST does not carry

- **Category.** The Publisher assigns editorial categories when it writes
  `artifacts.html`, after the AST is taken. The index uses the Publisher's
  default grouping by resource type and names every artefact where a
  published grouping differs (`--keep-published-grouping` keeps the grouping
  of a committed index still on disk).
- **Where it is published.** A canonical URL is an identity, not an address.
  The published base is the committed copy's `source.of` when that names a
  published site, else the instance declaration's `iriBase`, else none, and
  the run says which. Never derive either the published base or
  `canonicalBase` from the other.

AST-built artefacts are `materialized` with purpose `compiled`, and carry the
gates of `folio-assistant-core/schemas/materialization.ts`. `sourceLoss` and
`copyright` stay `unknown` until someone establishes them; a `permitted` there
would claim "no restrictions known" without having looked.

## What is never invented

- **`canonical` is optional.** Examples and instance resources have no
  canonical URL and are most of a large IG. Minting one produces an
  identifier that resolves to nothing while looking authoritative.
- **`category` absent never means "Other".** The IG's own artefact page has a
  literal `Other` section; a second one would make the word mean two things.
- **A lossy field is left absent, not repaired.** An absent field is a fact; a
  repaired one is a guess.

## When the source is a published site

The schema also accepts an index read from a published IG (`source.kind`
`gh-pages`, `output` or `url`), with `provenance` naming the published file
each part came from. These are different evidence: `output/` is a **local
build**, `gh-pages` is **what the world can see**; never label one as the
other. A published IG offers four partial views, none sufficient alone:

| file | holds | misses |
|---|---|---|
| `canonicals.json` | canonical URL, version, name | every artefact without a canonical |
| `package.tgz` → `package/.index.json` | every artefact's type and id | titles, categories, canonicals |
| `artifacts.html` | the editorial **category** and human title (per-row `title` is `ResourceType/id`) | anything machine-readable |
| `package.manifest.json` | package id, version, FHIR version, build date | — |

Traps:

- **Read the source, not the page about it.** `dak-api.html` links the
  enumeration schemas under `schemas/`, but they sit at the published root.
- **`openapi/openapi.json` is not the IG API.** On the WHO SMART Trust IG it
  is the DDCC Gateway API, subject matter that lives there. Key the overlay
  off each artefact's own stem (`<ResourceType>-<id>.openapi.json`), never a
  directory scan.
- **`.index.json` is lossy** (Organization entries can carry a truncated
  `"type": "["`). `canonicals.json` is the spine for anything canonical; a
  field seen only in `.index.json` stays absent.

## Running it

```sh
bun run cat ig-index:build -- [--only <instance>] [--work <dir>] [--plan]
```

`--plan` prints what would be built and touches nothing. Exit 0: every IG
found was built; 1: one or more failed (each named); 2: usage.

An IG instance is found, with no declaration of its own, when it needs
fhir-harness (directly or through a layer above), declares a `repository`,
and that repository carries an AST branch family. An instance missing any of
the three is skipped, and the run says which and why. To add an IG, give it
those three; never commit or hand-edit the index it produces.
