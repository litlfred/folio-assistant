/**
 * The ONE file in this instance that names where the platform lives.
 *
 * smart-base is staged here ahead of becoming its own repository
 * (`litlfred/smart-base`, plan `smart-separation-2026-10-01`, issue #1767,
 * bean `n3ni`). Every platform symbol the instance uses is re-exported from
 * here, so the day it leaves, re-pointing the platform is a one-file edit —
 * the same reason a folio's block manifests import `../schemas/builders`
 * and never folio-assistant directly. `instance-separation-imports.test.ts`
 * holds the rule: no other file here may reach outside the instance.
 *
 * The one split is `./schema.ts`, re-exported first below: the symbols of
 * the files the platform loads by glob (`themes/`, `schemas/`,
 * `pipeline/qa-checkers-*`), kept apart so those files do not carry this
 * barrel's IG-site imports into every check that loads them. The platform's
 * location is still named in this directory only.
 *
 * Grouped by the platform module each symbol comes from; a module that
 * moves is one line to change. Includes one test-support export
 * (`writeInstanceConfig`), because a test in this instance uses it.
 *
 * @module smart-base/platform
