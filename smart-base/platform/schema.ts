/**
 * The platform symbols of the files the platform itself loads by glob.
 *
 * The platform reads three of this layer's paths without being asked:
 * `cat-harness-tools/schemas/ui/theme-by-ref.ts` imports `themes/themes.ts`,
 * `schemas/kg/kind-validator.ts` imports `schemas/**`, and
 * `schemas/kg/harness-config.ts` imports `pipeline/qa-checkers-*.ts`. Each
 * then sits in the closure of every check that loads a theme, a kind or the
 * QA checkers, such as `skill:register:check` and `kg:audit:check`. Through
 * the full barrel (`index.ts`) those files also loaded fhir-harness's IG-site
 * and AST readers, whose unannotated input sites left those checks' CI
 * input-hash fingerprint undetermined (beans folio-assistant-x35i, vgfp,
 * k3vv). So they import from here, and `schema.test.ts` holds both halves:
 * they do not import `index.ts`, and this module's closure reaches no
 * fhir-harness file and no platform script.
 *
 * `index.ts` re-exports this module, so the barrel's surface is unchanged and
 * the platform's location is still named in this directory only.
 *
 * @module smart-base/platform/schema
