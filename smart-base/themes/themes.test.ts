/**
 * The theme is re-derived from `upstream/who.css`, never compared to itself.
 *
 * @module smart-base/themes/themes.test
 *
 * `who-iris/themes/themes.test.ts` set this bar and the reason is its own:
 * *"does not compare these constants against a copy of themselves … If the
 * capture is ever re-taken and IRIS has re-skinned, the tests fail rather than
 * the theme quietly describing a site that no longer looks like this."*
 *
 * The same risk is sharper here, because `local-template` depends on
 * `who.template.root#current` — upstream can re-skin at any time and the IG
 * picks it up on its next build. `UPSTREAM.template.sha` pins WHICH version
 * this theme describes; these tests assert the vendored bytes still say what
 * the theme claims they say.
 *
 * ## What is NOT tested here, deliberately
 *
 * That the rendered page looks like the IG. A theme is colour and geometry, the
 * top navbar is deliberately not reproduced (owner: *"navbar on LHS not top"*),
 * and a green test here is not a rendered page — which is the whole argument
 * for `bun run preview:site` existing.
