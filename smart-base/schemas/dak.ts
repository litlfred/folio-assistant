/**
 * The **DAK** content type — a repository that is a WHO SMART Guidelines
 * Digital Adaptation Kit.
 *
 * **This is a placeholder, and the placeholder is the point.** A repo declares
 * itself a DAK by carrying a {@link DAK_INDEX_SECTION} section in its root
 * `index.config.json`, as it declares itself a harness instance by carrying
 * `harness.json`. That
 * much is settled and is modelled here, and so is the wrapper each of WHO's
 * nine components uses (url, canonical or inline instance). What this module
 * does *not* model is the inside of an inline instance, nor the tenth component,
 * scheduling logic, which WHO's model lacks (`DAK_UNFORMALIZED_COMPONENTS`):
 * it **records the components without restating their contents**.
 *
 * ## Why a placeholder rather than waiting
 *
 * Because the marker is what a consumer needs first, and it does not depend on
 * the model. "Is this repository a DAK, and where does it publish?" is
 * answerable today; "what is inside `healthInterventions[0]`?" is not. Blocking
 * the first on the second would leave the type unrepresented for however long
 * the LM takes, and a type nothing can name is a type nothing can scan for.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT model
 *
 * **The inside of a component's inline instance.** Each of WHO's nine is
 * declared `0..* <Name>Source` in `smart-base`'s `input/fsh/models/DAK.fsh`,
 * and every `<Name>Source` in `DAKComponentSources.fsh` is the same wrapper:
 * a `url`, a `canonical`, or an inline `instance`, exactly one. Both models are
 * `#active` (bean `cz17`, 2026-10-24), so the cardinality and the wrapper
 * are enforced ({@link DakComponentSourceSchema}). The `instance` itself is
 * still `unknown` and is carried through untouched: typing nine instance
 * models here would be a second copy of WHO's, which is the argument
 * `schemas/dak-blocks.ts` already makes about `ValueSet.compose.include`.
 * Scheduling logic, which WHO's model does not have yet
 * (`DAK_UNFORMALIZED_COMPONENTS`), has no wrapper to follow, so its elements
 * stay `unknown`.
 *
 * **Anything else a real DAK declaration carries.** The schema is
 * {@link DakDeclarationSchema | passthrough}: unknown keys survive a
 * parse-and-write round trip. A placeholder that silently dropped the fields it
 * had not learned about yet would be worse than no placeholder — it would
 * destroy data from a real DAK on the first tool that read and rewrote one.
 *
 * ## Where the component vocabulary lives
 *
 * `smart-base/schemas/dak-kinds.ts` (core's `block-kinds.ts` until bean
 * `1335`), not here: {@link DAK_COMPONENTS} names the ten,
 * {@link DAK_COMPONENT_FIELDS} maps each to its field in WHO's own model, and
 * `smart-base/schemas/dak-blocks.test.ts` checks those names against a real
 * `DAK.fsh` when a `smart-base` checkout is present — reporting `n/a`, never a
 * pass, when it is not. This module builds its shape **from** that table rather
 * than restating it, so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * @module schemas/dak
 * @graphNode schema
