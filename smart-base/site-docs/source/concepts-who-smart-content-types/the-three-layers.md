WHO SMART Guidelines names **five** knowledge layers. FHIR content lives in
the first three, and those three are the clearest available vocabulary for
FHIR content generally:

| layer | what it holds | form |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** Narrative | narrative guidance — the publication a recommendation comes from | prose, figures, tables |
| **L2** Operational | the Digital Adaptation Kit — its ten components, from health interventions to test scenarios | BPMN, DMN, structured tables |
| **L3** Machine readable | the FHIR Implementation Guide | FSH → FHIR resources |
| L4 Executable | reference applications and services that execute the static algorithms | software |
| L5 Dynamic | dynamic algorithms trained and optimised on data — the precision-health model | models, analytics |

The five names and their meanings are from the WHO *Digital transformation
handbook for primary health care* (2024), §1.2 pp. 20–21
(`who-iris/library/9789240093362-eng`). Its ref. 18 is the primary source:
Mehl G. et al., *WHO SMART guidelines: optimising country-level use of
guideline recommendations in the digital age*, Lancet Digital Health
2021;3(4):e213–e216 (`smart-base/library/mehl-2021-who-smart-guidelines`,
CC BY 3.0 IGO), which presents the same five as "knowledge layers (L1–L5)".

**This page stops at L3.** L4 and L5 are software and trained models. They
consume what L1–L3 publish, but they are not authored as FHIR content, so
nothing in this platform validates them as content.

**They are layers, not stages.** All three are live at once: an L2 decision
table and the L3 `PlanDefinition` derived from it are both published and both
can change. Treating L2 as scaffolding that L3 replaces lets the two drift
apart unnoticed. An instance may also hold any one of the three without the
others: an L1 corpus with no DAK, or an IG with no L1.

**The SMART layers are not the platform's layers.** `cat-harness`, the content
core and the science layer are layers of *this software*; each depends on the
one before and inherits its skills and directories. L1–L5 are layers of
*guideline knowledge*. A WHO folio holds L1–L3 *content*; the platform layers
author and check it, and none of them is "the L2 layer". The deck that sets
the two side by side is `cat-harness/library/content/kg-folio-asst-2026-09-30`
(slide 1).
